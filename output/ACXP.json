(NASDAQ: ACXP) (\"we\" or \"Acurx\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, announced today that the Company's Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to $1 million in Bitcoin to hold as a treasury reserve asset.\n\n\"As demand for Bitcoin grows, and so does its acceptance as a major and primary asset class, we believe that Bitcoin will serve as a strong treasury reserve asset for cash not needed over the next 12 to 18 months\" said David P. Luci, President & CEO of Acurx. \"With the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the growing support from government agencies and institutional investors, it is a great addition to our treasury strategy. Its limited supply and inflation-resistant characteristics provide a functional store of value. This new treasury strategy is a finance strategy and has no impact on our overarching drug development plans.\"\n\n**About Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nAcurx Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections.

(NASDAQ: ACXP) (\"we\" or \"Acurx\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, announced today certain financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nHighlights of the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, or in some cases shortly thereafter, include:\n\n  * In July 2024, results from the ibezapolstat (IBZ) Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with C. _difficile_ Infection (CDI) were presented at the 17th Biennial Congress of the Anaerobe Society of the Americas by Taryn A. Eubank, PharmD, BCIDP, Research Assistant Professor, University of Houston College of Pharmacy delivered an oral presentation entitled: \"Clinical Efficacy of Ibezapolstat in CDI: Results from Phase 2 trials.\" \n  * Also in July 2024, and very timely given our late-stage development progress, the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) granted Acurx a new patent for ibezapolstat which specifically encompasses the \"treatment of _C. difficile_ Infection while reducing recurrence of infection and improving the health of the gut microbiome\". This patent expires in June 2042 and we believe will provide an important downstream competitive advantage. \n  * In August 2024, we submitted our request to FDA for a meeting to review our manufacturing processes and specifications for drug substance and final product and packaging (a \"CMC Meeting\") in order to commence Phase 3 clinical trials. This FDA submission is customary and follows our successful End of Ph2 clinical meeting with FDA which confirmed our Ph3 clinical trial readiness. We anticipate convening a meeting with FDA regarding CMC in the fourth quarter. \n  * In September 2024, a presentation was given by Executive Chairman, Bob DeLuccia, at the World Antimicrobial Resistance Scientific Congress held in Philadelphia. In his presentation at the Innovation Showcase session, he highlighted that we have a complete roadmap, not only for the required components of our phase 3 clinical program, but also what's required for ultimate filing of an NDA (or New Drug Application) which is to be followed by submissions for Marketing Authorizations in other countries around the world. He also presented an update on the Company's preclinical GPSSÂ® (Gram Positive Selective Spectrum) program for systemic oral and IV treatment of other gram-positive infections including, MRSA, VRE and DRSP. \n  * Also in September 2024, we participated at the 8th Annual _C. Difficile_ Symposium (or ICDS) in Bled, Slovenia, which is the premier global scientific venue for the review of _C. Difficile_ research. At the ICDS Meeting, two presentations were made on behalf of the Company. \n  * Additionally in September 2024, we announced that selected ACX-375 DNA pol IIIC analogues demonstrated in vitro activity against _B. anthracis_ (or Anthrax), which is a Bioterrorism Category A pathogen, including activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant Anthrax. This work was performed at two independent qualified laboratories including the University of Florida. Planning is underway for an Anthrax bioterrorism development program. \n  * In October 2024, we participated at IDWeek in Los Angeles, the annual scientific conference of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Drs. Kevin Garey and Taryn Eubank presented a scientific poster showing that in the Phase 2b clinical trial, ibezapolstat had comparable clinical cure and sustained clinical cure rates and safety profile to vancomycin. Also, 5 of 5 ibezapolstat patients who were followed for 3 months after end of treatment (EOT) experienced no recurrence. Ibezapolstat-treated patients showed decreased concentrations of fecal primary bile acids, and higher ratios of secondary to primary bile acids than vancomycin-treated patients. \n  * International regulatory filing initiatives will continue in Q4 2024.\n\n\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024****Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position** :The Company ended the quarter with cash totaling $5.8 million, compared to $7.5 million as of December 31, 2023. During the third quarter, the Company raised additional proceeds under its ATM financing program, with gross proceeds of approximately $1.6 million. \n  * **R &D Expenses**:Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.2 million compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in manufacturing related costs during the quarter of $0.1 million, offset by a reduction in consulting fees of $0.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 research & development expenses were $4.6 million compared to $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $0.5 million primarily due to $0.9 million increase in manufacturing related costs, offset by $0.4 million decrease in consulting fees. \n  * **G &A Expenses**:General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.6 million compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $0.2 million. The decrease was primarily due to $0.2 million increase in professional fees, a $0.1 million increase in compensation costs, offset by a $0.5 million decrease in non cash share-based compensation related costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were $6.7 million compared to $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $1.3 million. The increase was primarily due to $1.1 million increase in professional fees and a $0.2 million increase in legal costs. \n  * **Net Income/Loss** :The Company reported a net loss of $2.8 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of $3.1 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a net loss of $11.3 million or $0.71 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.77 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for the reasons previously mentioned. The Company had 16,770,378 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAs previously announced, David P. Luci, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert G. Shawah, Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call to discuss the results and provide a business update as follows:\n\nDate: |  Wednesday, November 13, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime: |  8:00 a.m. ET  \nToll free (U.S. and International): |  877-790-1503  \nConference ID: |  13749688  \n  \n**About Ibezapolstat**\n\nIbezapolstat is the Company's lead antibiotic candidate preparing to advance to international Phase 3 clinical trials to treat patients with _C. difficile_ Infection (CDI). Ibezapolstat is a novel, orally administered antibiotic being developed as a Gram-Positive Selective Spectrum (GPSSÂ®) antibacterial. It is the first of a new class of DNA polymerase IIIC inhibitors under development by Acurx to treat bacterial infections. Ibezapolstat's unique spectrum of activity, which includes _C. difficile_ but spares other Firmicutes and the important Actinobacteria phyla, appears to contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome.\n\nIn June 2018, ibezapolstat was designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the treatment of patients with CDI and will be eligible to benefit from the incentives for the development of new antibiotics established under the Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act. In January 2019, FDA granted \"Fast Track\" designation to ibezapolstat for the treatment of patients with CDI. The CDC has designated _C. difficile_ as an urgent threat highlighting the need for new antibiotics to treat CDI.\n\n**About Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nAcurx Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. The Company's approach is to develop antibiotic candidates with a Gram-positive selective spectrum (GPSSÂ®) that blocks the active site of the Gram+ specific bacterial enzyme DNA polymerase IIIC (pol IIIC), inhibiting DNA replication and leading to Gram-positive bacterial cell death.

Ibezapolstat is a novel,\norally administered antibiotic being developed as a Gram-Positive Selective Spectrum\n(GPSSÂ®) antibacterial. It is the first of a new class of DNA polymerase IIIC inhibitors under\ndevelopment by Acurx to treat bacterial infections. Ibezapolstat's unique spectrum of activity,\nwhich includes C. difficile but spares other Firmicutes and the important Actinobacteria\nphyla, appears to contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome.\nIn June 2018, ibezapolstat was designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nas a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the treatment of patients with CDI and\nwill be eligible to benefit from the incentives for the development of new antibiotics\nestablished under the Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act. In January\n2019, FDA granted \"Fast Track\" designation to ibezapolstat for the treatment of patients with\nCDI. The CDC has designated C. difficile as an urgent threat highlighting the need for new\nantibiotics to treat CDI.\nAbout Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAcurx Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a\nnew class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. The\nCompany's approach is to develop antibiotic candidates with a Gram-positive selective\nspectrum (GPSSÂ®) that blocks the active site of the Gram+ specific bacterial enzyme DNA\npolymerase IIIC (pol IIIC), inhibiting DNA replication and leading to Gram-positive bacterial\ncell death. Its R&D pipeline includes antibiotic product candidates that target Gram-positive\nbacteria, including Clostridioides difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n(MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and drug-resistant Streptococcus\npneumoniae (DRSP).\nTo learn more about Acurx Pharmaceuticals and its product pipeline, please visit\nwww.acurxpharma.com.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAny statements in this press release about our future expectations, plans and prospects,\nincluding statements regarding our strategy, future operations, prospects, plans and\nobjectives, and other statements containing the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\"\n\"expects,\" and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning\nof The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

INC.**\n\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n\n**NOTE 1 â NATURE OF OPERATIONS**\n\nBusiness\n\nAcurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly Acurx Pharmaceuticals, LLC (the âCompanyâ) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company formed in July 2017, with operations commencing in February 2018. The Company is focused on developing a novel class of antibiotics that address serious or life-threatening bacterial infections.\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, a global pandemic. This outbreak caused major disruptions to businesses and markets worldwide as the virus continued to spread. Previously, the Companyâs clinical trial operations were directly and indirectly adversely impacted, and could continue to be directly and indirectly adversely impacted, by the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the effect on the Companyâs operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, and governmental, regulatory and private sector responses, direct and indirect economic effects as a result of inflation, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Although the Company is unable to estimate the financial effect of the pandemic, at this time, if the pandemic continues over a long period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on the Companyâs business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The financial statements do not reflect any adjustments as a result of the pandemic.\n\nIn February 2018, the Company purchased the active pharmaceutical ingredient, the intellectual property and other rights to an antibiotic product candidate known as GLS362E (renamed ACX-362E and now approved for non-proprietary name, ibezapolstat) (the âAssetâ) from GLSynthesis, Inc. The Company paid $110,174 in cash, along with granting 100,000 Class B Membership Interests, profits interests as defined in the operating agreement, with an exercise price of $0.10 per share. The Company was also required to make certain milestone payments totaling $700,000 in aggregate if certain milestones are achieved, $50,000 of which has already been paid by the Company and royalty payments equal to 4% of net sales for a period of time equal to the last to expire of any applicable patents, as defined in the asset purchase agreement. The purchase of the Asset has resulted in our lead antibiotic product candidate, ibezapolstat, which targets the treatment of _C. difficile_ infections (âCDIâ).\n\nThe Companyâs primary activities since inception aside from organizational activities have included performing research and development activities relating to the development of its two antibiotic candidates and raising funds through equity offerings including its initial public offering (âIPOâ) consummated in June 2021. The Company has not generated any revenues since inception.\n\nThe Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. The Company has needed to raise capital from sales of its securities to sustain operations. On June 29, 2021, the Company completed the IPO, issuing 2,875,000 shares of common stock at a price of $6.00 per share, with gross proceeds of approximately $17.3 million. On July 27, 2022, the Company completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement, issuing 1,159,211 shares of common stock and 130,769 pre-funded warrants and Series A Warrants to purchase 1,289,980 shares of common stock and Series B Warrants to purchase 1,289,980 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $4.2 million. On May 18, 2023, the Company completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement, issuing 601,851 shares of common stock, 731,482 pre-funded warrants, Series C Warrants to purchase 1,333,333 shares of common stock and Series D Warrants to purchase 1,333,333 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $4.0 million. On November 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement and established an âAt-the-Marketâ offering (the âATM Programâ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through A.G.P/Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the ATM Program, the Company sold a total of 2,692,190 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $9.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $5.8 million, which based on current estimates will not be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance of the condensed interim financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024. Management believes that the Company will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and will need additional resources to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever. Management plans to seek additional equity financing and grant funding, but cannot assure that such financing and funding will be available at acceptable terms, or at all. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that the Companyâs research and development will be successfully completed or that any Company product \n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ncandidate will be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (âFDAâ) or any other worldwide regulatory authority or become commercially viable. The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biopharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative arrangements, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements.\n\nâ\n\n**NOTE 2 â SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (âGAAPâ) and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim reporting. In the opinion of management, these unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the Companyâs financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The unaudited interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may occur for the full fiscal year. The year-end condensed interim balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. Management believes that the disclosures provided herein are adequate when these unaudited condensed interim financial statements are read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of December 31, 2023 filed in Form 10-K.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company estimates an annual effective tax rate of 0% as the Company incurred net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in an estimated net loss for both financial statement and tax purposes. Therefore, no current federal or state income tax expense has been recorded in the financial statements.\n\nBased on the Companyâs history of generating operating losses and its anticipation of operating losses for the foreseeable future, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits from those net operating losses would not be realized and a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets has been recorded. Should the Companyâs assessment change, tax benefits associated with the historic net operating loss carryforwards could be limited due to future ownership changes.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company applied for a qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities in the amount of $51,127 and is included within the âOther Receivableâ on the accompanying condensed interim balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nThe Company maintains the majority of its cash balance in one financial institution. The balance is insured up to the maximum allowable by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (âFDICâ). The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant risk of loss on cash. At times, the cash balance may exceed the maximum insured limit of the FDIC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of approximately $5.8 million in U.S. bank accounts which was not fully insured by the FDIC.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe Company expenses research and development costs when incurred. At times, the Company may make cash advances for future research and development services. These amounts are deferred and expensed in the period the service is provided. The Company incurred research and development expenses in the amount of $1,198,184 and $1,348,985 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $4,578,777 and $4,100,954 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nCosts for certain research and development activities, such as the provision of services for clinical trial activity, are estimated based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks which may use data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to the Company by its vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as applicable. The estimates are adjusted to reflect the best information available at the time of the financial statement issuance. The Companyâs estimate of the status and timing of services performed could differ from the actual status and timing of services performed.\n\nShare-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company accounts for the cost of services performed by employees, directors and consultants received in exchange for an award of the Companyâs common stock or stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense based on the requisite service period.\n\nCompensation expense associated with stock option awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the option at the grant date determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected price volatility. The Companyâs employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value computation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Because there is no public market for the Companyâs stock options and very little historical experience with the Companyâs stock, similar public companies were used for the comparison of volatility and the dividend yield. The risk-free rate of return was derived from U.S. Treasury notes with comparable maturities.\n\nShare-Based Payments to Vendors\n\nThe Company accounts for the cost of services performed by vendors in exchange for an award of common stock, stock options, or warrants based on the grant-date fair value of the award or the fair value of the services rendered, whichever is more readily determinable. The Company recognizes the expense in the same period and in the same manner as if the Company had paid cash for the services.\n\nMajor Vendor\n\nThe Company had three major vendors that accounted for approximately 44% of the research and development expenditures for the each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a major vendor that accounted for approximately 59% and 66% of the research and development expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were three vendors who accounted for approximately 65% of the total accounts payable and accrued expenses and as of December 31, 2023, these vendors accounted for 54% of the total accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\n**NOTE 3 â ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES**\n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n\nâ\n\nâ| â| â| â| â| â| â  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nâ| **September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \nAccrued research and development| â| $|  2,968,508| â| $|  2,263,934  \nAccrued compensation expenses| â|  247,210| â|  716,307  \nAccrued professional fees| â|  83,950| â|  58,388  \nOther accounts payable and accrued expenses| â|  19,097| â|  3,809  \nTotal| â| $|  3,318,765| â| $|  3,042,438  \n  \nâ\n\nâ\n\n**NOTE 4 â ISSUANCE OF EQUITY INTERESTS**\n\nOn June 23, 2021, Acurx Pharmaceuticals, LLC was converted into a corporation and renamed Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The pre-funded warrants sold to the 2023 Investor have an exercise price of $0.0001 and were immediately exercisable. All of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in June 2023.\n\nThe gross proceeds to the Company from the 2023 Registered Offering were approximately $4.0 million and net proceeds after deducting the placement agentâs fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company were approximately $3.5 million.\n\nIn a concurrent private placement (the â2023 Private Placementâ and together with the 2023 Registered Offering, the â2023 Offeringsâ), the Company issued to the Investor Series C warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 1,333,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.26 per share and Series D Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 1,333,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.26 per share. The Series C Warrants were exercisable commencing on November 18, 2023 and will expire on November 18, 2025. The Series D Warrants were exercisable commencing on November 18, 2023 and will expire on November 19, 2029.\n\nIn connection with the 2023 Offerings, the Company also entered into a Warrant Amendment Agreement with the 2023 Investor. Under the Warrant Amendment Agreement, the Company amended its existing Series A warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,230,769 shares of the common stock and Series B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,230,769 shares of the common stock (collectively, the âExisting Warrantsâ) that were previously issued in July 2022, such that the amended Existing Warrants have a termination date of May 18, 2029. The Company used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the change in the value of the aforementioned Series A and Series B Warrants attributable to the change in the termination date, with an estimated increase in fair value of approximately $2.0 million. This amount was recorded as both an increase to additional paid-in capital and as a non-cash issuance cost of the 2023 offerings. \n\nIn January 2024, the Affiliate Investors exercised 59,211 of Series B Warrants which generated approximately $0.2 million in proceeds for the Company.\n\nThe following table summarizes information with respect to outstanding warrants to purchase common stock of the Company as of September 30, 2024:\n\nâ\n\nâ| â| â| â| â| â| â  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nâ| â| â| â| â| **Weighted Average**  \nâ| â| **Number of Warrants**| **Exercise Price**  \nBalance at December 31, 2023| â| â|  6,195,456| â| $|  3.28  \nIssued| â|  â| â| â|  â  \nExercised| â|  (59,211)| â| â|  3.55  \nBalance at September 30, 2024| â|  6,136,245| â| $|  3.28  \n  \nâ\n\nThe weighted average contractual life of the outstanding warrants is 3.76 years.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement and established the ATM Program, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the Sales Agreement, the sales agent is entitled to compensation of 3.0% of the gross offering proceeds of all shares sold through it pursuant to the Sales Agreement.\n\nThe Company sold 1,994,069 shares of its common stock under the ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $3.21 per share, raising $6.4 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of $6.2 million, after deducting commissions to the sales agent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company sold a total of 2,692,190 shares of its common stock under the ATM Program, at a weighted-average price of $3.35 per share, raising $9.0 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of $8.6 million, after deducting commissions to the sales agent and other ATM Program related expenses.

The Company recorded $27,630 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to compensation expense for these options.\n\nCompensation expense associated with these awards is recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of the option at the grant date determined based on the Black-Scholes model. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected price volatility. The Companyâs employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value computation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Because there is no public market for the Companyâs stock options and very little historical experience with the Companyâs stock, similar public companies were used for the comparison of volatility and the dividend yield. The risk-free rate of return was derived from U.S. Treasury notes with comparable maturities.\n\nThe Company determined the fair value of the option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions:\n\nâ\n\nâ| â| â| â| â| â| â| â  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nâ| **Nine Months Ended**  \nâ| **Sep 30,**  \nâ| **2024**|  â| **2023**  \nExpected term| â|  6.72| years| â| â|  6.90| years  \nVolatility| â|  103| %| â| â|  98| %  \nDividend yield| â|  â| %| â| â|  â| %  \nRisk-free interest rate| â|  4.28| %| â| â|  3.85| %  \nWeighted average grant date fair value| $|  2.59| â| â| $|  2.75| â  \n  \nâ\n\nA summary of the Companyâs stock option activity is as follows:\n\nâ\n\nâ| â| â| â| â| â| â| â| â| â  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nâ| â| â| â| â| â| **Weighted**|  â| â  \nâ| â| â| â| â| â| **Average**|  â| â| â  \nâ| â| â| **Weighted**|  â| **Remaining**|  â| **Aggregate**  \nâ| **Number of**| **Average**|  â| **Contractual Term**|  â| **Intrinsic**  \nâ| **Options**| **Exercise Price**|  â| **(in years)**|  â| **Value**  \nOutstanding, vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023|  2,985,000| â| $|  5.64| â|  7.81| â| $|  251,550  \nGranted|  895,000| â| â|  3.10| â|  9.44| â| â|  â  \nExercised|  â| â| â|  â| â|  â| â| â|  â  \nForfeited|  â| â| â|  â| â|  â| â| â|  â  \nOutstanding, vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2024|  3,880,000| â| $|  5.05| â|  7.61| â| $|  â  \nExercisable|  2,915,556| â| $|  5.68| â|  7.09| â| $|  â  \n  \nâ\n\nThe total non-cash compensation expense for these options not yet recognized as of September 30, 2024 was $2,517,214.

MANAGEMENTâS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n _The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed_ _interim_ _financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the discussion under the heading âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsâ for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K (the â2023 Annual Reportâ) and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) on March 15, 2024. This discussion, particularly information with respect to our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading âSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statementsâ in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should review the disclosure under the heading âRisk Factorsâ in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements._\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. Our approach is to develop antibiotic candidates with a Gram-positive selective spectrum (âGPSSÂ®â) that block the active site of the Gram positive specific bacterial enzyme deoxyribonucleic acid (âDNAâ) polymerase IIIC (\"pol IIICâ), inhibiting DNA replication and leading to Gram-positive bacterial cell death. Our research and development (âR&Dâ) pipeline includes antibiotic product candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria, including _Clostridioides difficile_ , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (âMRSAâ), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (âVREâ) and drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (âDRSPâ).\n\nThese bacterial targets are listed as priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (âWHOâ), the United States (âU.S.â) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (âCDCâ) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (âFDAâ). Priority pathogens are those which require new antibiotics to address the worldwide crisis of antimicrobial resistance (âAMRâ) as identified by the WHO, CDC and FDA. \n\n**Our Market Opportunity**\n\nThe CDC estimates that, in the U.S., antibiotic-resistant pathogens infect one individual every 11 seconds and result in one death every 15 minutes. The WHO recently stated that growing antimicrobial resistance is equally as dangerous as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and may leave us defenseless against infections that today can be treated easily. According to the WHO, the current clinical development pipeline remains insufficient to tackle the challenge of the increasing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nWe believe we are developing the first DNA pol IIIC inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical trials and our Phase 2 clinical trial has provided positive clinical trial results for our lead pol IIIC antibiotic candidate.\n\nPol IIIC is the primary catalyst for DNA replication of several Gram-positive bacterial cells. Our research and development pipeline includes clinical stage and early-stage antibiotic candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria for oral and/or parenteral treatment of infections caused by _Clostridioides difficile_ (âC. difficileâ), Enterococcus (including VRE), Staphylococcus (including MRSA), and Streptococcus (including antibiotic resistant strains).\n\nPol IIIC is required for the replication of DNA in certain Gram-positive bacterial species. By blocking this enzyme, our antibiotic candidates are believed to be bactericidal and inhibit proliferation of several common Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including both sensitive and resistant _C. difficile_ , MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (âPRSPâ) and other resistant bacteria.\n\nWe expect to partner with a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company for late-stage clinical trials and commercialization or conduct Phase 3 clinical trials prior to such partnership and continue to review partnership opportunities on an ongoing basis up to FDA approval.\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur lead antibiotic candidate, ibezapolstat (formerly named ACX-362E), has a novel mechanism of action that targets the pol IIIC enzyme, a previously unexploited scientific target. A Phase 2 clinical trial, comprised of a Phase 2a segment and a Phase 2b segment, provided data that demonstrates positive clinical trial results for our lead antibiotic candidate and demonstrates pol IIIC as an appropriate bacterial target.\n\n**Our Lead Product Candidate**\n\nCurrently available antibiotics used to treat _C_ _. difficile_ infections (âCDIâ) utilize other mechanisms of action. We believe ibezapolstat is the first antibiotic candidate in late-stage clinical trials to work by blocking the DNA pol IIIC enzyme in _C. difficile_. This enzyme is necessary for replication of the DNA of certain Gram-positive bacteria, like _C. difficile_.\n\n**Our Other Candidates**\n\nWe also have an early-stage pipeline of antibiotic product candidates with the same previously unexploited mechanism of action, which has established proof of concept in animal studies. This pipeline includes ACX-375C, a potential oral and parenteral treatment targeting Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA, VRE and PRSP.\n\nWe continue to evaluate strategic transactions for the Company, including a partner for the further development and potential commercialization of our lead antibiotic candidate, ibezapolstat, as well as a potential sale, merger, third-party licensing arrangement or other strategic transaction. At this time, we have no commitments from potential partners or others to provide the Company with capital.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn September 26, 2024, we announced results from new analyses that extend data on the beneficial effects of ibezapolstat on the gut microbiome. The data show an increased proportion of actinobacteriota and increased quantity of beneficial bacillota (firmicutes) leading to reversal of dysbiosis and contributing to the CDI anti-recurrence effect of ibezapolstat. Microbiological testing of certain ACX-375 DNA pol IIIC analogues in independent qualified laboratories, including the University of Florida, demonstrated in vitro activity with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.5-2mcg/mL against B.anthracis, a Bioterrorism Category A pathogen including activity against ciprofloxacin resistant B. anthracis. These results were presented at the premier International C _.difficile_ Symposium (âICDSâ) held in Bled, Slovenia in September 2024.\n\nOn September 24, 2024, we announced results from our pioneering research with ibezapolstat in collaboration with Leiden University Medical Center. This detailed demonstration of the mode of action of DNA pol IIIC inhibitors in general, and for ibezapolstat specifically, is critically important to support our scientific foundation and our regulatory filings as we advance into this late-stage of ibezapolstat's development. These results were similarly presented at the ICDS held in September 2024.\n\nIbezapolstat Phase 2 Clinical Results\n\nOn November 2, 2023, we announced top-line results from the Phase 2b segment of our Phase 2 clinical trial of ibezapolstat in patients with CDI. In the Phase 2b segment of the clinical trial, the observed Clinical Cure rate in the per protocol population was 15 of 16 patients (94%) in the ibezapolstat arm and 14 out of 14 patients (100%) in the vancomycin arm, respectively. In the Phase 2a segment of the clinical trial that evaluated ibezapolstat in patients with CDI, the observed Clinical Cure rate in the per protocol population was 10 out of 10 patients (100%). In a post hoc analysis conducted with the data available at the time of discontinuation of the trial, the overall observed Clinical Cure rate for ibezapolstat in the combined Phase 2a and Phase 2b segments of the clinical trial in patients with CDI was 96% (25 out of 26 patients), based on 10 out of 10 patients (100%) in the Phase 2a segment in the per protocol population, plus 15 out of 16 (94%) patients in the Phase 2b segment We believe that, based on the post hoc pooled Phase 2 ibezapolstat Clinical Cure rate of 96% and the historical vancomycin cure rate of approximately 81% (VancocinÂ® Prescribing Information, January 2021), Phase 3 trials conducted in accordance with the applicable FDA Guidance for Industry (October 2022) would be able to demonstrate the non-inferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin, though there can be no assurance that these early-stage, Phase 2 data will predict results in Phase 3 clinical trials. \n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nFurther analysis of the secondary and exploratory endpoints from the Phase 2b segment showed the following:\n\nâ| 15 of 15 (100%) of the ibezapolstat-treated patients who achieved Clinical Cure (âCCâ) at end of treatment (âEOTâ) remained free of _C. difficile_ Infection (âCDIâ) recurrence through one month after EOT, for a Sustained Clinical Cure (âSCCâ) rate of 100%. In the Phase 2a segment, 10 of 10 (100%) of the ibezapolstat-treated patients who had achieved CC at EOT remained free of CDI recurrence through one month after EOT, for an SCC rate of 100%;   \n---|---  \nâ| 2 of 14 patients treated with standard of care, vancomycin, experienced recurrent infection within one month after EOT for a SCC of 86%;  \n---|---  \n  \nFor extended clinical cure, data also showed that 100% (5 of 5) of ibezapolstat-treated patients who agreed to observation for up to three months following CC at EOT experienced no recurrence of infection;\n\nâ| Additional microbiology and microbiome analysis of patients in the Phase 2b segment data showed that ibezapolstat outperformed vancomycin showing eradication of fecal _C. difficile_ at Day 3 of treatment in 15 of 16 treated patients (94%), versus vancomycin which had eradication of _C. difficile_ in 10 of 14 treated patients (71%); and  \n---|---  \nâ| Ibezapolstat, but not vancomycin, consistently preserved and allowed regrowth of key gut bacterial species believed to confer health benefits including to prevent recurrence of CDI.  \n---|---  \n  \nIbezapolstat was well-tolerated in the Phase 2 clinical trial. In the Phase 2b segment, there were three patients each experiencing one mild adverse event assessed by the blinded investigator to be drug-related. All three events were gastrointestinal in nature and resolved without treatment. In the Phase 2a segment, there were seven adverse events reported in four patients, with only one (nausea) likely related to ibezapolstat. One severe adverse event occurred (an exacerbation of a migraine headache) but was considered to be unrelated to ibezapolstat. There were no drug-related treatment withdrawals or no drug-related serious adverse events, or other safety findings of concern in either segment of the Phase 2 clinical trial. \n\nFurther analyses will be forthcoming regarding other exploratory endpoints from the Phase 2b segment of the Phase 2 clinical trial later this year. The Company anticipates presenting data from the Phase 2 clinical trial at one or more scientific conferences throughout 2024. \n\nWe convened an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA on April 17, 2024 and announced on May 15, 2024 that we had a successful meeting, including confirmation of Phase 3 readiness for ibezapolstat for the treatment of _C. difficile_ infection. Agreement with the FDA was reached on key elements to move forward with our international Phase 3 clinical trial program. Agreement was also reached with the FDA on the complete non-clinical and clinical development plan for filing of a New Drug Application (âNDAâ) for marketing approval. Planning continues to advance ibezapolstat into international Phase 3 clinical trials for treatment of _C. difficile_ infection (âCDIâ). We are also now preparing to submit requests for guidance to initiate clinical trials in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada, as well as preparing for a manufacturing meeting with the FDA to be scheduled prior to Phase 3 enrollment.\n\nIn July 2024, we announced that a new patent has been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (âUSPTOâ). This patent relates to ibezapolstat and its use to treat _C. difficile_ infection while reducing the recurrence of the infection, as well as improving the health of the gut microbiome. This is the latest in the series of granted patents and pending patent applications that we have filed to protect our proprietary technologies in the field of antimicrobials.\n\nFollowing our successful End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA, which confirmed our Phase 3 clinical trial readiness, and per the FDA regulatory requirements, in August 2024, we submitted our request to the FDA for a meeting to review our manufacturing processes and specifications for drug substance and final project and packaging (typically referred to as Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (âCMCâ)) for our Phase 3 clinical trials. We anticipate the FDA to grant a meeting in the fourth quarter.\n\n2023 At-the-Market Offering\n\nOn November 15, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established an âATM Programâ, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through A.G.P/Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of our common stock having an \n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\naggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the Sales Agreement, the sales agent is entitled to compensation of 3.0% of the gross offering proceeds of all shares of common stock sold through it pursuant to the Sales Agreement. \n\nAs of the period ended September 30, 2024, we sold a total of 2,692,190 shares of our common stock under the ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $3.35 per share, raising $9.0 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of $8.6 million, after deducting commissions to the sales agent and other ATM Program related expenses. As of November 11, 2024, total sales under the ATM Program since it was implemented in November 2023 are approximately $9.0 million out of the total $17 million ATM facility. \n\nThere remains approximately $8.0 million available for future sales of shares of common stock under the ATM Program.\n\nEffects of Coronavirus (COVID-19) on Our Business\n\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations or those of our collaborators, vendors, contractors, suppliers, clinical trial sites and other material business relations and governmental agencies will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the ultimate duration of the outbreak, new information that will emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain it or treat its impact, among others. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the ultimate duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic, have been, and continue to be, difficult to assess or predict, the spread of COVID-19 has caused a broad impact globally. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business continues to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\n\nâ\n\nComponents of our Results of Operations\n\nRevenue\n\nWe have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nTo date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to development of ibezapolstat, preclinical studies and other preclinical activities related to our portfolio. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received.\n\nResearch and development expenses include:\n\nâ| external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (âCROsâ) and consultants to conduct our preclinical, toxicology and other preclinical studies;  \n---|---  \nâ| laboratory supplies;  \n---|---  \nâ| costs related to manufacturing product candidates, including fees paid to third-party manufacturers and raw material suppliers;  \n---|---  \nâ| license fees and research funding; and  \n---|---  \nâ| facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities, insurance, equipment and other supplies.  \n---|---  \n  \nClinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors. We outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities such as CROs, independent clinical investigators and other third-party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical trials.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates and seek to discover and develop new product candidates. Due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development, we cannot determine with certainty the timing of the initiation, duration or costs of future clinical trials and preclinical studies of product candidates. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and the amount of development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate or program on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidateâs commercial potential. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.\n\nOur future clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:\n\nâ| per-patient trial costs;  \n---|---  \nâ| the number of trials required for regulatory approval;  \n---|---  \nâ| the number of sites included in the trials;  \n---|---  \nâ| the countries in which the trials are conducted;  \n---|---  \nâ| the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;  \n---|---  \nâ| the number of patients that participate in the trials;  \n---|---  \nâ| the number of doses that patients receive;  \n---|---  \nâ| the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;  \n---|---  \nâ| potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;  \n---|---  \nâ| the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;  \n---|---  \nâ| the phase of development of the product candidate; and  \n---|---  \nâ| the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.  \n---|---  \n  \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include facility-related costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services and insurance costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities, pre-commercialization and, if any product candidates receive marketing approval, commercialization activities. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with operating as a public company.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the changes in our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023:\n\nâ\n\nâ| â| â| â| â| â| â| â| â| â  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nâ| â| **Three Months Ended**|  â| â  \nâ| â| **September 30,**|  â| **Percentage**|  â  \nâ| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nâ| â| **(in thousands)**|  â| â  \nOPERATING EXPENSES:| â| â| â  \nResearch and Development| â| $|  1,198| â| $|  1,349|  (11)| %  \nGeneral and Administrative| â|  1,623| â|  1,766|  (8)| %  \nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES| â|  2,821| â|  3,115|  (9)| %  \nNet Loss| â| $|  (2,821)| â| $|  (3,115)|  (9)| %  \n  \nâ\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses were $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $0.1 million primarily due to $0.1 million increase in manufacturing related costs offset by $0.2 million decrease in consulting fees.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $0.2 million.

The increase was primarily due to $1.1 million increase in professional fees and $0.2 million increase in legal costs. \n\nNet Loss\n\nNet loss was $11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $1.8 million, due to the reasons stated above.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOverview\n\nSince inception, we have generated no revenue from operations and we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately $64.5 million as of September 30, 2024. We have funded our operations primarily from equity issuances. We received net cash proceeds of approximately $12.9 million from equity financings closed between March 2018 and October 2020. On June 29, 2021, we completed our IPO resulting in net proceeds of approximately $14.8 million after deducting underwriter discounts of $1.4 million and offering costs of approximately $1.1 million. On July 27, 2022, we completed a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement resulting in net proceeds of approximately $3.7 million after deducting placement agents fees of $0.3 million and offering costs of $0.2 million. On May 18, 2023, we completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement resulting in net proceeds of approximately $3.5 million after deducting placement agents fee of $0.2 million and offering costs of $0.2 million. On November 15, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established the ATM Program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the ATM Program, we raised net proceeds of approximately $8.6 million after deducting sales agent commissions and other related expenses of $0.4 million.\n\nBased upon our lack of revenue expected for the foreseeable future, and because of numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research, development and future commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our anticipated clinical trials and development activities.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of $2.7 million, consisting primarily of $5.8 million of cash, $0.2 million of other receivable and prepaid expenses, offset by approximately $3.3 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nThe following table sets forth selected cash flow information for the periods indicated:\n\nâ\n\nâ| â| â| â| â| â| â  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nâ| **Nine Months Ended**  \nâ| **September 30,**  \nâ| **2024**| **2023**  \nâ| â| **(in thousands)**  \nNet cash (used in)/provided by:| â| â  \nOperating activities| â| $|  (8,133)| â| $|  (5,603)  \nFinancing activities| â|  6,421| â|  3,544  \nNet increase/(decrease) in cash| â| $|  (1,712)| â| $|  (2,059)  \n  \nâ\n\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net loss was greater than the net cash used in operating activities by $3.2 million, primarily attributable to share-based compensation and share-based vendor payments of $2.9 million and increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.3 million.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss was greater than the net cash used in operating activities by $3.8 million, primarily attributable to share-based compensation and share-\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nbased vendor payments of $2.5 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.2 million and decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.1 million.\n\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided from financing activities was $6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily attributable to the ATM Program.\n\nNet cash provided from financing activities was $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was attributable to the net proceeds from the registered direct offering.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur managementâs discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, âSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,â we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be most critical to the preparation of our financial statements.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nWe expense research and development costs when incurred. At times, we may make cash advances for future research and development services. These amounts are deferred and expensed in the period the services are provided. \n\nCosts for certain research and development activities, such as the provision of services for clinical trial activity, are estimated based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks which may use data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as applicable. The estimates are adjusted to reflect the best information available at the time of the financial statement issuance. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our estimate of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary.\n\nShare-Based Compensation\n\nWe account for the cost of services performed by employees, directors and consultants received in exchange for an award of the Companyâs common stock or stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We recognize compensation expense based on the requisite service period.\n\nCompensation expense associated with stock option awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the option at the grant date determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected price volatility. Our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value computation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Because there is no public market for our stock options and very little historical experience with our stock, similar public companies were used for the comparison of volatility and the dividend yield. The risk-free rate of return was derived from U.S. Treasury notes with comparable maturities. We will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and will adjust our Black-Scholes option pricing assumptions as appropriate. Any changes in the foregoing Black-Scholes assumptions, or if we were to elect to utilize an alternative method for valuing stock options granted to employees, officers and directors, could potentially impact our stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations.\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nShare-Based Payments to Vendors\n\nWe account for the cost of services performed by vendors in exchange for an award of our common stock or stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of the award or the fair value of the services rendered, whichever is more readily determinable. We also use Black-Scholes option pricing model for the purpose of estimating the fair value of options and warrants. Changes in our Black-Scholes assumptions, or if we were to utilize an alternative method for valuing options or warrants issued to our vendors, could impact our expense and our results of operations.\n\nOther Company Information\n\nEmerging Growth Company Status\n\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the âJOBS Actâ). Under the JOBS Act, companies have extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected this exemption to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\n\nIn addition, we intend to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, we are entitled to rely on certain exemptions as an emerging growth company; we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditorâs attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b), (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditorâs report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we no longer meet the requirements of being an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, _Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures_ , which expands the disclosures required for income taxes. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis while retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.\n\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nWe maintain âdisclosure controls and procedures,â as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECâs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \n\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nWe can give no assurance that weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in managementâs evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\n _The_ _following_ _risk factors and other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected._\n\nOur business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. These risks include the following:\n\nâ| We are a clinical-stage company and have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.  \n---|---  \nâ| We have incurred significant net losses in each period since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.  \n---|---  \nâ| Our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.  \n---|---  \nâ| We may need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.  \n---|---  \nâ| Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.  \n---|---  \nâ| We are reliant on the success of our lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, which we are developing for the treatment of CDI. If we are unable to commercialize ibezapolstat, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.  \n---|---  \nâ| If serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate.  \n---|---  \nâ| Ibezapolstat or our other product candidates may never achieve sufficient market acceptance even if we obtain regulatory approval.  \n---|---  \nâ| We are exposed to product liability, and non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us, should lawsuits be filed against us.  \n---|---  \nâ| Our current and future operations substantially depend on our management team and our ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.  \n---|---  \nâ| Our failure to complete or meet key milestones relating to the development of our technologies and proposed products and formulations would significantly impair our financial condition.  \n---|---  \nâ| We will compete with larger and better capitalized companies, and competitors in the drug development or pharmaceutical industries may develop competing products which outperform or supplant our proposed products.  \n---|---  \nâ| A pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our business.  \n---|---  \nâ| Global market and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.  \n---|---  \nâ| Because results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Moreover, interim, âtop-line,â and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish may change, or the perceived product profile may be negatively impacted, as more patient data or additional endpoints (including efficacy and safety) are analyzed.  \n---|---  \n  \n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nâ| If clinical trials of our lead product candidate fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, or the European Medicines Agency (âEMAâ), or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete the development and commercialization of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate.  \n---|---  \nâ| If we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.  \n---|---  \nâ| We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, be unable to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.  \n---|---  \nâ| Risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our product development should we elect to extend development outside the U.S.  \n---|---  \nâ| Our results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and regulatory actions.  \n---|---  \nâ| If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing ibezapolstat or any other product candidate if and when such product candidates are approved.  \n---|---  \nâ| We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and our ongoing clinical trials, and expect to continue to do so for additional clinical trials and ultimately for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or drugs or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.  \n---|---  \nâ| If ultimate users of our product candidates are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third- party payers, or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our proposed products may be limited and we may not achieve material revenues.  \n---|---  \nâ| We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents.  \n---|---  \nâ| Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.  \n---|---  \nâ| Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.  \n---|---  \nâ| The price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.  \n---|---  \nâ| Our largest stockholders will exercise significant influence over our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.  \n---|---  \nâ| Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.  \n---|---  \nâ| We may fail to comply with evolving privacy and data protection laws, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n---|---  \nâ| There may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially harm us.  \n---|---  \n  \nRisks Relating to Our Business\n\nWe are a clinical-stage company and have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. \n\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that was formed in July 2017. We acquired the rights to our lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, in February 2018 and we have a limited operating history. Our operations to date have been limited to securing our initial product candidate, generating a second product candidate in-house, conducting clinical and regulatory development for our lead program and raising capital. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue.\n\nInvesting in an early-stage company with limited history, financial or otherwise, includes a high degree of risk. As an early-stage company, our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. We have generated losses since inception and we expect to continue to run at a loss for several years until our initial program, or one of our pipeline products, is approved by the FDA or another worldwide regulatory body. We expect to incur substantial operating expenses over the next several years as our product development activities and related \n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ncosts increase. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully implement any or all of our business plan, or if implemented, that we will accomplish the desired objectives, including achieving profitability. Our short history as an operating company makes any assessment of our future success or viability subject to significant uncertainty. We will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving fields. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business will suffer.\n\nWe have incurred significant net losses in each period since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability**.**\n\nWe are not profitable and have incurred significant losses in each period since our inception, including net losses of $11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We have not commercialized any products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. We expect these losses to increase as we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, scale-up manufacturing capabilities and hire additional personnel to support the development of our product candidates and to enhance our operational, financial and information management systems.\n\nA critical aspect of our strategy is to invest significantly in our clinical and regulatory development for our lead program. To become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize products with significant market potential, which we may never achieve. Even if we succeed in commercializing one or more of these product candidates, we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future relating to our substantial research and development expenditures to develop our product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholdersâ equity and working capital. Further, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our discovery and preclinical development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations and may require us to raise additional capital that may dilute your ownership interest. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm noted in its report accompanying our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, that we had suffered significant accumulated deficit and had negative operating cash flows and that the development and commercialization of our product candidates are expected to require substantial expenditures. We have not yet generated any material revenues from our operations to fund our activities, and are therefore dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in obtaining the necessary financing to continue our operations. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we cannot successfully continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in our common stock.\n\nWe may need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\n\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue research and development and initiate additional clinical trials of our product candidates and seek regulatory approval for these and potentially other product candidates. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. In particular, the costs that may be required for the manufacture of any product candidate that receives marketing approval may be substantial. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $5.8 million in cash. In June 2021, we completed the IPO for net cash proceeds of $14.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In July 2022, we completed a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement for net cash proceeds of $3.7 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. In May 2023, we completed a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement for net cash proceeds of $3.5 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. In November 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established an ATM Program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. As of the period ended September 30, 2024, we sold a total of 2,692,190 shares of our common stock under the ATM Program, at a weighted-average price of $3.35 per share, raising $9.0 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of $8.6 million after deducting commissions to the sales agent and other ATM Program related expenses. There remains approximately $8.0 million available for future sales of shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement. We believe that, based upon our current operating plan, our existing capital resources will not be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations for at least 12 months from the issuance of our condensed interim financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024. Our future capital requirements and the period for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect. Our monthly spending levels vary based on new and ongoing research and development and other corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with successful research and development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities.\n\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\nâ| the timing, progress, and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates;  \n---|---  \nâ| our ability to manufacture sufficient clinical supply of our products candidates and the costs thereof;  \n---|---  \nâ| discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the design and conduct of our clinical trials and the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;  \n---|---  \nâ| the cost and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;  \n---|---  \nâ| the costs of any other product candidates or technologies we pursue;  \n---|---  \nâ| our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;  \n---|---  \nâ| the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and  \n---|---  \nâ| the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our ability to raise additional funding will depend on financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, over which we may have no or limited control, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. In addition, our ability to obtain future funding when needed through equity financings, debt financings or strategic collaborations may be particularly challenging in light of the uncertainties and circumstances regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates or other research and development initiatives. We could be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves.\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAny of the above events could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\n\nUntil such time as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships, and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves. \n\nWe are reliant on the success of our lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, which we are developing for the treatment of CDI. If we are unable to commercialize ibezapolstat, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which may not occur for several years, if ever, currently depends heavily on the successful development and commercialization of ibezapolstat. The success of ibezapolstat will depend on a number of factors, including the following: \n\nâ| successful completion of clinical development;   \n---|---  \nâ| receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;   \n---|---  \nâ| establishing commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;   \n---|---  \nâ| obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;   \n---|---  \nâ| protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;   \n---|---  \nâ| establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;   \n---|---  \nâ| launching commercial sales of ibezapolstat, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;   \n---|---  \nâ| acceptance of ibezapolstat, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;   \n---|---  \nâ| effectively competing with other CDI therapies; and   \n---|---  \nâ| maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of ibezapolstat following approval.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize ibezapolstat, which would materially harm our business. \n\nIf serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate.\n\nOur product candidates are in clinical development and its risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development \n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nto certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. \n\nMany compounds that initially show promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects or other safety issues that prevented further development. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidate will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from such product candidate will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences could materially harm our business. \n\nIbezapolstat or our other product candidates may never achieve sufficient market acceptance even if we obtain regulatory approval**.**\n\nIf ibezapolstat or any of our other future product candidates receive marketing approval, such products may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or revenue from collaboration agreements or any profits from operations. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: \n\nâ| the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments or competitive products;   \n---|---  \nâ| the prevalence and severity of any side effects;   \n---|---  \nâ| the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;   \n---|---  \nâ| convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;   \n---|---  \nâ| the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;   \n---|---  \nâ| obtaining regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing;   \n---|---  \nâ| our ability to timely and effectively manufacture, market and distribute our products, either on our own or through third parties;   \n---|---  \nâ| pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other health plan administrators;   \n---|---  \nâ| the timing of any such marketing approval in relation to other product approvals;   \n---|---  \nâ| support from patient advocacy groups;   \n---|---  \nâ| our ability to attract corporate partners, including pharmaceutical companies, to assist in commercializing our proposed formulations or products; and   \n---|---  \nâ| any restrictions on concomitant use of other medications.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by the relevant constituencies, or adequate pricing, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. \n\nWe are exposed to product liability, and non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us, should lawsuits be filed against us.\n\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We expect that such claims are likely to be asserted against us at some point, although we do carry product liability and clinical trial insurance to mitigate this risk. In addition, the use in our clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the subsequent sale of these formulations or products by us or our potential \n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ncollaborators may cause us to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur current and future operations substantially depend on our management team and our ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\n\nOur business does and will depend in substantial part on the continued services of David P. Luci, Robert J. DeLuccia and Robert G. Shawah. The loss of the services of any of these individuals would significantly impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and result in the failure to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance on any member of our management, which would leave us uncompensated for the loss of any member of our management. \n\nOur future financial condition and ability to achieve profitability will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing our operations. There is a risk that we will be unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and our failure to do so may severely damage our prospects. \n\nOur failure to complete or meet key milestones relating to the development of our technologies and proposed products and formulations would significantly impair our financial condition.\n\nIn order to be commercially viable, we must research, develop and obtain regulatory approval to manufacture, introduce, market and distribute formulations or products incorporating our technologies. For each drug that we formulate, we must meet a number of critical developmental milestones, including: \n\nâ| demonstration of the benefit of each specific drug through our drug delivery technologies;   \n---|---  \nâ| demonstration, through non-clinical and clinical trials, that our drug delivery technologies are safe and effective; and   \n---|---  \nâ| establishment of a viable current good manufacturing process (âcGMPâ) capable of potential scale-up.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe estimated required capital and time frames necessary to achieve these developmental milestones is subject to inherent risks, many of which are beyond our control. As such, we may not be able to achieve these or similar milestones for any of our proposed product candidates or other product candidates in the future. Our failure to meet these or other critical milestones would adversely affect our financial condition. \n\nConducting and completing the clinical trials necessary for FDA approval is costly and subject to intense regulatory scrutiny as well as the risk of failing to meet the primary endpoint of such trials. We will not be able to commercialize and sell our proposed products and formulations without completing such trials. \n\nIn order to conduct clinical trials that are necessary to obtain approval by the FDA to market a formulation or product, it is necessary to receive clearance from the FDA to conduct such clinical trials. The FDA can halt clinical trials at any time for safety reasons or because we or our clinical investigators did not follow the FDAâs requirements for conducting clinical trials. If we are unable to receive clearance to conduct clinical trials or the trials are permanently halted by the FDA, we would not be able to achieve any revenue from such product as it is illegal to sell any drug or medical device for human consumption or use without FDA approval. Moreover, there is a risk that our clinical trials will fail to meet their primary endpoints, which would make them unacceptable in having the subject product approved by the FDA. If this were to occur, such event would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe will compete with larger and better capitalized companies, and competitors in the drug development or pharmaceutical industries may develop competing products which outperform or supplant our proposed products. \n\nDrug companies and/or other technology companies have developed (and are currently marketing in competition with us), have sought to develop and may in the future seek to develop and market similar product candidates and drug delivery technologies which may become more accepted by the marketplace or which may supplant our technology entirely. In addition, many of our current competitors are, and future competitors may be, significantly larger and better financed than we are, thus giving them a significant advantage over us. Our competitors may also have significantly greater expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These \n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ncompetitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific advisors and consultants as well as management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Other small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We may be unable to respond to competitive forces presently in the marketplace which would severely impact our business. \n\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth and expansion or implement our business strategies, in which case our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe expected growth of our business, if it occurs, will place increased demands on our management, operational and administrative resources. These increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less effectively which, in turn, could cause a deterioration in our financial performance and negatively impact our growth. Any planned growth will also require that we continually monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems, as well as our infrastructure. \n\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our business and achieve our goals. Even if we succeed in establishing new strategic partnerships, we cannot assure that we will achieve planned revenue or profitability levels in the time periods estimated by us, or at all. If any of these initiatives fails to achieve or is unable to sustain acceptable revenue and profitability levels, we may incur significant costs.\n\nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations or those of our collaborators, contractors, suppliers, CROs, clinical sites, contract manufacturing organizations (âCMOsâ) and other material business relations and governmental agencies will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, new information that will emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain it or treat its impact, among others. Previously, our clinical trial operations were directly and indirectly adversely impacted, and could continue to be directly and indirectly adversely impacted, by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nThe spread of COVID-19 could also have adverse economic impacts to us. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic, have been, and continue to be, difficult to assess or predict, the spread of COVID-19 has caused a broad impact globally.\n\nGlobal, market and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\n\nThe results of our operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, the global financial markets and the global political conditions. The U.S. and global economies are facing growing inflation, higher interest rates and a potential recession. Furthermore, a severe or prolonged economic downturn, including a recession or depression resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or political disruption such as the war between Ukraine and Russia and the conflict involving Israel and Hamas could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our programs and development candidates, if approved, relationships with any vendors or business partners located in affected geographies and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy or political disruption, including any international trade disputes, could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our potential products. Any of the foregoing could seriously harm our business, and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the political or economic climate and financial market conditions could seriously harm our business.\n\nIncreases in inflation could raise our costs for commodities, labor, materials and services and other costs required to grow and operate our business, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial condition. Additionally, increases in inflation, along with the uncertainties surrounding geopolitical developments and global supply chain disruptions, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment. A failure to adequately respond to these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In response to high levels of inflation and recession fears, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of \n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nEngland have raised, and may continue to raise, interest rates and implement fiscal policy interventions. Even if these interventions lower inflation, they may also reduce economic growth rates, create a recession, and have other similar effects.\n\nThe U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the U.S. Although U.S. lawmakers have previously passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, there is a history of ratings agencies lowering or threatening to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States given such uncertainty. On August 1, 2023, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.âs long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA as a result of these repeated debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns. The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. governmentâs sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions.\n\nIf the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary equity or debt financing more difficult to secure, more costly or more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could harm our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon plans with respect to our business, including clinical development plans. Further, recent developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our business. If the financial institutions with which we do business enter receivership or become insolvent in the future, there is no guarantee that the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, will intercede to provide us and other depositors with access to balances in excess of the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit, that we would be able to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, that we would be able to maintain any required letters of credit or other credit support arrangements, or that we would be able to adequately fund our business for a prolonged period of time or at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the impact that the high market volatility and instability of the banking sector more broadly could have on economic activity and our business in particular. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers or other third parties with which we conduct business may not survive difficult economic times, including the current global situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, the instability of the banking sector, and the uncertainty associated with current worldwide economic conditions, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\n\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\n\nWe believe that climate change has the potential to negatively affect our business and results of operations, cash flows and prospects. We are exposed to physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels), risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy (such as additional legal or regulatory requirements, changes in technology, market risk and reputational risk) and social and human effects (such as population dislocations and harm to health and well-being) associated with climate change. These risks can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).\n\nThe adverse impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires (exacerbated by drought), flooding, and extreme heat. Extreme weather and sea-level rise pose physical risks to our facilities as well as those of our suppliers. Such risks include losses incurred as a result of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by such natural disasters and extreme weather events. Other potential physical impacts due to climate change include reduced access to high-quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, which could impact future product development. These risks could disrupt our operations and supply chains, which may result in increased costs.\n\nNew legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the environment. These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could result in us being subject to new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency, upgrade of facilities to meet new building codes, and the redesign of \n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nutility systems, which could increase our operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy used by us. Our supply chain would likely be subject to these same transitional risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to us.\n\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\n\nThe availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. \n\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the U.S. and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. \n\nBecause results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Moreover, interim, âtop-line,â and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish may change, or the perceived product profile may be negatively impacted, as more patient data or additional endpoints (including efficacy and safety) are analyzed**.**\n\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. The outcome of preclinical development testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidates. Once a product candidate has displayed sufficient preclinical data to warrant clinical investigation, we will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are effective with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in populations for their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Many drug candidates fail in the early stages of clinical development for safety and tolerability issues or for insufficient clinical activity, despite promising pre-clinical results. Accordingly, no assurance can be made that a safe and efficacious dose can be found for these compounds or that they will ever enter into advanced clinical trials alone or in combination with other product candidates. Moreover, success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Companies frequently experience significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. There is an extremely high rate of failure of pharmaceutical candidates proceeding through clinical trials. \n\nIndividually reported outcomes of patients treated in clinical trials may not be representative of the entire population of treated patients in such studies. In addition, larger scale Phase 3 studies, which are often conducted internationally, are inherently subject to increased operational risks compared to earlier stage studies, including the risk that the results could vary on a region to region or country to country basis, which could materially adversely affect the outcome of the study or the opinion of the validity of the study results by applicable regulatory agencies. \n\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose top-line or preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of such data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data from the particular study or trial, including all endpoints and safety data. As a result, top-line or preliminary results that we \n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nreport may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Top-line or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the topline, interim, or preliminary data we previously published. When providing top-line results, we may disclose the primary endpoint of a study before all secondary endpoints have been fully analyzed. A positive primary endpoint does not translate to all, or any, secondary endpoints being met. As a result, top-line and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available, including data from the full safety analysis and the final analysis of all endpoints. \n\nFurther, from time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. For example, time-to-event based endpoints such as duration of response and progression free survival have the potential to change, sometimes drastically, with longer follow-up. In addition, as patients continue on therapy, there can be no assurance given that the final safety data from studies, once fully analyzed, will be consistent with prior safety data presented, will be differentiated from other similar agents in the same class, will support continued development, or will be favorable enough to support regulatory approvals for the indications studied. Further, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. The information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and regulators or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. If the interim, top-line or preliminary data that we report differ from final results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition. \n\n**Risks Related to Regulatory Approval**\n\nIf clinical trials of our lead product candidate fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, or the EMA, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete the development and commercialization of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate.\n\nIn connection with obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials, particularly with a small number of patients, may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. \n\nMoreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believe their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. \n\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\n\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including: \n\nâ| clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;   \n---|---  \nâ| the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;   \n---|---  \n  \n36\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nâ| we may be unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect any statistically significant treatment effects;   \n---|---  \nâ| our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;   \n---|---  \nâ| regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;   \n---|---  \nâ| we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;   \n---|---  \nâ| we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;   \n---|---  \nâ| regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;   \n---|---  \nâ| clinical trials are costly and the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;   \n---|---  \nâ| the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and   \n---|---  \nâ| our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate the clinical trials.   \n---|---  \n  \nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. \n\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.\n\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates, including our planned clinical trials of ibezapolstat, if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these clinical trials. CDI is an acute infection that requires rapid diagnosis. For our clinical trials of ibezapolstat, we need to identify potential patients, test them for CDI and enroll them in the clinical trial within a 24-hour period. In addition, our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitorsâ product candidates. For our clinical trials of ibezapolstat, we need to identify potential patients and enroll them in the clinical trial based on a history of diarrhea within 24 hours of a positive stool test for _C. difficile_ toxin. \n\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our planned clinical trials of ibezapolstat would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. \n\nâ\n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, be unable to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\n\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, quality, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs. Rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials, and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to a continuously evolving regulatory environment and unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them. \n\nThe time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. The standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when regulating companies such as ours are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Any analysis we perform of data from chemistry, manufacturing and controls, preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\n\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the particular product candidate for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which we may market the product or the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (âREMSâ) as a condition of approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or safe use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing rights to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients as specially defined by the indication statement or who meet certain safe-use criteria, and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry, among other requirements. These limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party payors. \n\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and payment. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by comparable regulatory authorities outside of the United States and vice versa.\n\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed drugs will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight. If we or our collaborators or contractors fail to comply with continuing U.S. and foreign requirements, our approvals, if obtained, could be limited or withdrawn, we could be subject to other penalties, and our business would be seriously harmed.\n\nFollowing any initial regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop, we will also be subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of adverse drug experiences and safety data that are reported after our drug products are made commercially available. This would include results from any post-marketing studies or surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug product required as a condition of approval or agreed to by us. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which the product may be marketed. Other ongoing regulatory requirements include, among other things, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing, as well as continued maintenance of our marketing application, compliance with cGMP requirements and quality oversight, compliance with post-marketing commitments, and compliance with good clinical practice (âGCPâ) for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in warning or untitled letters, criminal or civil penalties, recalls, or product withdrawals. In addition, we are conducting our clinical trials and we intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in jurisdictions outside of the United States, and therefore will be subject to, and must comply with, regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions. \n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe FDA has significant post-market authority, including, for example, the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-market studies or clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The FDA also has the authority to require a REMS plan after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug. \n\nWe, our CMOs, and the manufacturing facilities we use to make our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing assessment of product quality, compliance with cGMP, and periodic inspection by the FDA and potentially other regulatory agencies. We or our CMOs may not be able to comply with applicable cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our CMOs, to comply with applicable regulations could result in regulatory actions, such as the issuance of FDA Form 483 notices of observations, warning letters or sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. We may not have the ability or capacity to manufacture material at a broader commercial scale in the future. We and our CMOs currently manufacture a limited supply of clinical trial materials. Reliance on CMOs entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured all of our material ourselves, including reliance on the CMO for regulatory compliance. Our product promotion and advertising will also be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. \n\nIf we or our collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements in the United States or foreign jurisdictions in which we may seek to market our products, we or they may be subject to, among other things, fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, refusal by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, refusal to permit the import or export of products, operating restrictions, injunction, consent decree, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\n\nOur product candidates for which we obtain approval may face competition sooner than anticipated.\n\nEven if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate ahead of our competitors, our future pharmaceutical products may face direct competition from generic and other follow-on drug products. Any of our product candidates that may achieve regulatory approval in the future may face competition from generic products earlier or more aggressively than anticipated, depending upon how well such approved products perform in the U.S. prescription drug market. Our ability to compete may also be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. \n\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (âFDCAâ) authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved for marketing under the NDA provisions of the statute pursuant to abbreviated new drug applications (âANDAsâ), and also created the Section 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. An ANDA relies on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a previously approved reference listed drug and must demonstrate to the FDA that the generic drug product is identical to the reference listed drug (âRLDâ) with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug and also that it is âbioequivalentâ to the reference listed drug. In contrast, Section 505(b)(2) enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDAâs prior findings of safety and efficacy data for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) provides an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products; for example, a follow-on applicant may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. Such products, if approved and depending upon the scope of the changes made to the reference drug, may also compete with any product candidates for which we receive approval.\n\nThe FDA is prohibited by statute from approving an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA when certain marketing or data exclusivity protections apply to the reference listed drug. However, if any competitor or third party is able to demonstrate bioequivalence without infringing our patents, then such competitor or third party may then be able to gain approval of an ANDA and introduce a competing generic product onto the market.\n\nFurthermore, the CREATES Act established a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish necessary samples of an RLD on âcommercially reasonable, market-based terms.â If generic developers request samples of any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval in order to conduct comparative testing to support one or more ANDAs for a generic version of our products, and we refuse any such request, we may be subject to litigation under the CREATES Act. Although lawsuits have been filed under the CREATES Act since its enactment, those \n\n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nlawsuits have settled privately; therefore, to date, no federal court has reviewed or opined on the statutory language and there continues to be uncertainty regarding the scope and application of the law.\n\nWe cannot predict the interest of potential follow-on competitors or how quickly others may seek to come to market with competing products, whether approved as a direct ANDA competitor or as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA referencing one of our future product candidates. If the FDA approves generic versions of any of our products in the future, should they be approved for commercial marketing, such competitive products may be able to immediately compete with us in each indication for which our product has received approval, which could negatively impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on our investments.\n\nRisks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our product development should we elect to extend development outside the U.S.\n\nShould we elect to extend development outside the U.S., we may be subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:\n\nâ¢| differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries; more stringent privacy requirements for data to be supplied to our operations in the United States, e.g., GDPR in the EU;  \n---|---  \n  \nâ\n\nâ¢| unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;  \n---|---  \n  \nâ\n\nâ¢| differing payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price controls;  \n---|---  \n  \nâ\n\nâ¢| foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;  \n---|---  \n  \nâ\n\nâ¢| workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;  \n---|---  \n  \nâ\n\nâ¢| continued uncertainties related to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU (known as âBrexitâ) and its financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications, which could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate, and which may further create global economic uncertainty, which could materially adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows;   \n---|---  \n  \nâ\n\nâ¢| production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad, including those that may result from the recent coronavirus outbreak; and  \n---|---  \n  \nâ\n\nâ¢| business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and regulatory actions.\n\nLegislative and regulatory actions affecting government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently. In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the âACAâ) was enacted in 2010 to expand healthcare coverage. Since then, numerous efforts have been made to repeal, amend or administratively limit the ACA in whole or in part. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. We expect that future changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry in the United States. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in \n\n40\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nexisting requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAdditionally, on December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 was signed into law (P.L. 116-94) and includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 (the âCREATES Actâ). The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic product developers need samples of a reference listed drug, to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on âcommercially reasonable, market-based terms.â Whether and how generic product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on any of our future commercial products are unknown.\n\nFor a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The maximum amount that a manufacturer may charge a 340B covered entity for a given product is the average manufacturer price (âAMPâ), reduced by the rebate amount paid by the manufacturer to Medicaid for each unit of that product. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of childrenâs hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.\n\nMoreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive healthcare provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drug products covered under Medicare Part B report the productâs average sales price to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (âCMSâ) beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (âDHHSâ) has also solicited feedback on various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drugs and has implemented others under its existing authority.\n\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed into the law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the âIRAâ). The IRA has multiple provisions that may impact the prices of drug products that are both sold into the Medicare program and throughout the United States. Starting in 2023, a manufacturer of a drug or biological product covered by Medicare Parts B or D must pay a rebate to the federal government if the drug productâs price increases faster than the rate of inflation. This calculation is made on a drug product by drug product basis and the amount of the rebate owed to the federal government is directly dependent on the volume of a drug product that is paid for by Medicare Parts B or D. Additionally, starting in payment year 2026, CMS will negotiate drug prices annually for a select number of single source Part D drugs without generic or biosimilar competition. CMS will also negotiate drug prices for a select number of Part B drugs starting for payment year 2028. If a drug product is selected by CMS for negotiation, it is expected that the revenue generated from such drug will decrease. CMS has begun to implement these new authorities and entered into the first set of agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers to conduct price negotiations in October 2023. However, the IRAâs impact on the pharmaceutical industry in the United States remains uncertain, in part because multiple large pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders (e.g., the U.S. Chamber of Commerce) have initiated federal lawsuits against CMS arguing the program is unconstitutional for a variety of reasons, among other complaints. Those lawsuits are currently ongoing.\n\nIn addition, many states have proposed or enacted legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing, such as by requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. For example, in recent years, several states have formed prescription drug affordability boards (âPDABsâ). Much like the IRAâs drug price negotiation program, these PDABs have attempted to implement upper payment limits (âUPLsâ) on drugs sold in their respective states in both public and commercial health \n\n41\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nplans. In August 2023, Coloradoâs PDAB announced a list of five prescription drugs that would undergo an affordability review. The effects of these efforts remain uncertain pending the outcomes of several federal lawsuits challenging state authority to regulate prescription drug payment limits. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the statesâ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers (âPBMsâ) and other members of the healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area. The Federal Trade Commission (âFTCâ) in mid-2022 also launched sweeping investigations into the practices of the PBM industry that could lead to additional federal and state legislative or regulatory proposals targeting such entitiesâ operations, pharmacy networks, or financial arrangements. Significant efforts to change the PBM industry as it currently exists in the U.S. may affect the entire pharmaceutical supply chain and the business of other stakeholders, including pharmaceutical product developers like us.\n\nChanges to the Medicaid program at the federal or state level could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Proposals that could impact coverage and reimbursement of our products, including giving states more flexibility to manage drugs covered under the Medicaid program and permitting the re-importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries, could have a material adverse effect by limiting our productsâ use and coverage. Furthermore, state Medicaid programs could request additional supplemental rebates on our products as a result of an increase in the federal base Medicaid rebate. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, they could use the enactment of these increased rebates to exert pricing pressure on our products, and the adverse effects may be magnified by their adoption of lower payment schedules. \n\nOther proposed regulatory actions affecting manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is difficult to predict the impact, if any, of any such proposed legislative and regulatory actions or resulting state actions on the use and reimbursement of our products in the U.S., but our results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\n\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing ibezapolstat or any other product candidate if and when such product candidates are approved.\n\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale or marketing of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. If ibezapolstat receives marketing approval, we intend to commercialize it in the U.S. with our own focused, specialized sales force. We plan to evaluate the potential for utilizing additional collaboration, distribution and marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize ibezapolstat in other jurisdictions where we retain commercialization rights. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. \n\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include: \n\nâ| our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;   \n---|---  \nâ| the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;   \n---|---  \nâ| the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with more extensive product lines; and   \n---|---  \nâ| unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales and marketing services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues will likely be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may \n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nbe unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates. \n\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and our ongoing clinical trials, and expect to continue to do so for additional clinical trials and ultimately for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or drugs or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\n\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture supplies of our product candidates for use in development and commercialization. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the production of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials under the guidance of members of our organization. We do not have long-term supply agreements. Furthermore, the raw materials for our product candidates are sourced, in some cases, from a single-source supplier although other sources are available. For example, drug substance and drug product are sourced from our principal supplier, Piramal Pharma Solutions, in Ennore, India and Ahmedabad, India, respectively. Chemical raw materials used for drug substance manufacture are sourced locally in India and are generally available. Accordingly, we do not anticipate difficulties sourcing drug substance for our clinical trials or, if FDA approved, for our marketing period, but we have not yet sourced a backup supplier because we currently have sufficient supply to complete our Phase 2b clinical trial. We are considering U.S. sources of drug substance for the commercial period if ibezapolstat is FDA approved and we anticipate several manufacturing options will be available. If we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of any of our product candidates or any of our future product candidates for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials. \n\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to maintain or establish required agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including: \n\nâ| the failure of the third party to manufacture our product candidates according to our schedule, or at all, including if our third-party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements between us and them;   \n---|---  \nâ| the reduction or termination of production or deliveries by suppliers, or the raising of prices or renegotiation of terms;   \n---|---  \nâ| the termination or nonrenewal of arrangements or agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;   \n---|---  \nâ| the breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them;   \n---|---  \nâ| the failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;   \n---|---  \nâ| the failure of the third party to manufacture our product candidates according to our specifications;   \n---|---  \nâ| the mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified;   \n---|---  \nâ| clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and   \n---|---  \nâ| the misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.   \n---|---  \n  \nWe do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacturing both active drug substances and finished drug \n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nproducts. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the U.S. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain marketing approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we do not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA, EMA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could subject us and our third-party manufacturers to warning letters or other enforcement-related letters, holds on clinical trials or could result in further sanctions being imposed on us or our third-party manufacturers, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates or drugs and harm our business and results of operations. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or drugs may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis. \n\nWe rely on third party clinical investigators, contract research organizations (âCROsâ), clinical data management organizations and consultants to design, conduct, supervise and monitor preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. Because we rely on third parties and do not have the ability to conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials independently, we have less control over the timing, quality and other aspects of preclinical studies and clinical trials than we would if we conducted them on our own. These investigators, CROs and consultants are not our employees and we have limited control over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. These third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from our programs. Further, these third parties may not be diligent, careful or timely in conducting our preclinical studies or clinical trials, resulting in the preclinical studies or clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful. \n\nIf we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third parties do not carry out their contractual duties, satisfy legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical studies or clinical trials or meet expected deadlines, our preclinical and clinical development programs could be delayed and otherwise adversely affected. In all events, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. The FDA and other health authorities require preclinical studies to be conducted in accordance with GLP and clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with GCP, including conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. If we or our CROs fail to comply with these requirements, the data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable or uninterpretable and the FDA may require us to perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Any such event could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \n\nIf ultimate users of our product candidates are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third- party payers, or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our proposed products may be limited and we may not achieve material revenues.\n\nThe continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital. For example, in the U.S., given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of such proposals and related laws, rules and regulations could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. Moreover, the passage of the ACA in 2010, and efforts to amend or repeal such law, has created significant uncertainty relating to the scope of government regulation of healthcare and related legal and regulatory requirements, which could have an adverse impact on sales of our products.\n\nMoreover, our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of such products and related treatments are obtained by governmental authorities, private health \n\n44\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ninsurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Consumers and third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical drugs and services. Also, the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S. and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and drugs, as well as legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce government insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our proposed products. \n\nOur relationships with future customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\n\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and may not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patientsâ rights are and will be applicable to our business. These regulations include: \n\nâ| the Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid, and which will constrain our marketing practices and the marketing practices of our licensees, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities;   \n---|---  \nâ| the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of âdesignated health servicesâ with whom the physician or a member of the physicianâs immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies;   \n---|---  \nâ| federal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent, and which may expose entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers to potential criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and including as a result of claims presented in violation of the Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA;   \n---|---  \nâ| the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (âHIPAAâ), which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services that, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;   \n---|---  \nâ| federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA which requires manufacturers of approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations;   \n---|---  \nâ| the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which, among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and   \n---|---  \n  \n45\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nâ| state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industryâs voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and which may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws such as HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.   \n---|---  \n  \nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. \n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents.\n\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we or our collaborators may be required to file infringement lawsuits that can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one of our patents is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put any pending applications at risk of being interpreted narrowly and of not issuing. \n\nInterference proceedings or derivation proceedings may be filed to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors (if any). An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors (if any), misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S. Other proceedings, such as proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board, filed by a third party may result in the invalidation of one or more of our patents. \n\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. \n\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\n\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, regardless of their merit, would cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneysâ fees for willful infringement, in addition to paying royalties, redesign infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. A court may also issue an injunction against us preventing us from manufacturing and bringing our products to market. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such \n\n46\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nlitigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace. \n\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that is important or necessary to the development or commercialization of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. Such licenses may not be available which could prevent us from commercializing our products. Further, if we are alleged to infringe third party intellectual property rights, we could face costly litigation, the outcome of which could negatively affect or prevent us from commercializing or developing our products. In the event of an adverse decision against us in a litigation, we could be required to: pay substantial damages and license fees, or even be prevented from using or commercializing our technologies and methods; and also be prevented from further research and development efforts. In such case, we may be unable to develop alternative non-infringing products or methods and unable to obtain one or more licenses from third parties. \n\nIf we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our rights to intellectual property or secure rights to third-party patents, we may lose valuable rights, experience reduced market share, assuming any, or incur costly litigation to enforce, maintain or protect such rights.\n\nOur ability to license, obtain, enforce and maintain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others is important to the commercialization of any formulations or products under development. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including ours, are frequently uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, our patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights may not provide protection against competitive technologies or products or may be held invalid if challenged or could be circumvented. Our competitors may also independently develop products similar to ours or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to, or licensed by, us. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. law. Any of these occurrences would have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, costs and lost management time, as well as uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. \n\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\n\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we will also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary and confidential information, to maintain our competitive position. We will seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that we will have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we do execute will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement could breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary or confidential information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some \n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ncourts inside and outside the U.S. are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, particularly unpatented know-how, were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. \n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\n\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our members. \n\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management**.**\n\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management. The existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Furthermore, we have the authority to issue shares of our preferred stock without further stockholder approval, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a âpoison pillâ to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our board of directors does not approve. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following: \n\nâ| our authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise;   \n---|---  \nâ| our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;   \n---|---  \nâ| our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter, except in certain circumstances;   \n---|---  \nâ| a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors or a majority of our board of directors;   \n---|---  \nâ| advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders; and   \n---|---  \nâ| certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and any amendments to our bylaws by our stockholders will require the approval of at least two-thirds of our then-outstanding voting power entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class.   \n---|---  \n  \n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe are an âemerging growth company,â and a âsmaller reporting companyâ and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\n\nWe are an âemerging growth company,â as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including: \n\nâ| being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim condensed financial statements, with correspondingly reduced âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsâ disclosure in this Form 10-Q;   \n---|---  \nâ| not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;   \n---|---  \nâ| reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and   \n---|---  \nâ| exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.   \n---|---  \n  \nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. \n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. \n\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the extended transition period for adopting new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act as an emerging growth company. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. \n\nWe are also a smaller reporting company, and we will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year following the determination that our voting and non-voting shares of common stock held by non-affiliates is more than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenues are less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting shares of common stock held by non-affiliates is more than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. \n\nSimilar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations, such as an exemption from providing selected financial data and an ability to provide simplified executive compensation information and only two years of audited financial statements. \n\nThe price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment**.**\n\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section and many others beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this âRisk Factorsâ section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our 2023 Annual Report, these factors include:\n\nâ| the commencement, enrollment, completion or results of our current Phase 2b clinical trial of ibezapolstat;  \n---|---  \n  \n49\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nâ| any delay in our regulatory filings for ibezapolstat or our future product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authorityâs review of such filings, including without limitation the FDAâs issuance of a ârefusal to fileâ letter or a request for additional information;  \n---|---  \nâ| adverse results or delays, suspensions or terminations in future preclinical studies or clinical trials;  \n---|---  \nâ| our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;  \n---|---  \nâ| adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate or the failure of a regulatory authority to accept data from preclinical studies or clinical trials conducted in other countries;  \n---|---  \nâ| changes in laws or regulations applicable to ibezapolstat or any other product candidate, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;  \n---|---  \nâ| adverse developments concerning our manufacturers;  \n---|---  \nâ| our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;  \n---|---  \nâ| our inability to establish collaborations, if needed;  \n---|---  \nâ| our failure to commercialize our product candidates, if approved;  \n---|---  \nâ| additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;  \n---|---  \nâ| unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate;  \n---|---  \nâ| introduction of new products or services offered by us or our competitors;  \n---|---  \nâ| announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;  \n---|---  \nâ| our ability to effectively manage our growth;  \n---|---  \nâ| actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;  \n---|---  \nâ| our cash position;  \n---|---  \nâ| our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;  \n---|---  \nâ| publication of research reports about us or our industry, or product candidates in particular, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;  \n---|---  \nâ| changes in the market valuations of similar companies;  \n---|---  \nâ| changes in the structure of the healthcare payment systems;  \n---|---  \nâ| overall performance of the equity markets;  \n---|---  \nâ| sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;  \n---|---  \nâ| trading volume of our common stock;  \n---|---  \n  \n50\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nâ| changes in accounting practices;  \n---|---  \nâ| ineffectiveness of our internal controls;  \n---|---  \nâ| disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;  \n---|---  \nâ| significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;  \n---|---  \nâ| general political, economic and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control, such as military conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas; and  \n---|---  \nâ| other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\n\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managementâs attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation. \n\nOur largest stockholders will exercise significant influence over our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\n\nOur officers, directors and their affiliates currently collectively own 5,105,432 shares of our common stock (on an as-converted basis) or approximately 26% of our outstanding shares of common stock (on an as-converted basis) as of September 30, 2024. Accordingly, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they could have a significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or all or a significant percentage of our assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us. \n\nWe cannot assure you that the interests of our officers, directors and affiliated persons will coincide with the interests of the investors. So long as our officers, directors and affiliated persons collectively controls a significant portion of our common stock, these individuals and/or entities controlled by them, will continue to collectively be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over our company. \n\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investorsâ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions**.**\n\nShould we fail to satisfy the Nasdaqâs continued listing requirements, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaqâs listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below Nasdaqâs minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with the Nasdaqâs listing requirements. \n\n51\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf Nasdaq does not maintain the listing of our securities for trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: \n\nâ| a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;   \n---|---  \nâ| reduced liquidity for our common stock;   \n---|---  \nâ| a determination that our common stock is a âpenny stockâ which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;   \n---|---  \nâ| a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and   \n---|---  \nâ| a decreased ability to issue additional common stock or obtain additional financing in the future.   \n---|---  \n  \nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert managementâs attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\n\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased, and will likely continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters, higher administrative expenses and a diversion of managementâs time and attention. Further, if our compliance efforts differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. Being a public company that is subject to these rules and regulations also make it more expensive for us to obtain and retain director and officer liability insurance and we may in the future be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain or retain adequate coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers.\n\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\n\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early-stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss. \n\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material and could exceed the limits of the cybersecurity insurance we maintain, if any, against such risks. If the information technology systems of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring. \n\nWe cannot assure you that our data protection efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in our systems, or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations, or financial condition. For example, if such an event were to occur and cause \n\n52\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ninterruptions in our operations, or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, it could result in a material disruption of our programs and the development of our services and technologies could be delayed. Furthermore, significant disruptions of our internal information technology systems or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or security breaches could result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information), which could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For instance, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our customers or employees, could harm our reputation directly, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. \n\nAlthough we take measures to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to personnel error, malfeasance, or other malicious or inadvertent disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, manipulated, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. \n\nAny such access, breach, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under domestic or foreign privacy, data protection and data security laws such as HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (âHITECHâ), and penalties. Notice of certain security breaches must be made to affected individuals, the Secretary of HHS, and for extensive breaches, notice may need to be made to the media or state attorneys general. Such notice could harm our reputation and our ability to compete. Although we have implemented security measures, such data is currently accessible through multiple channels, and there is no guarantee we can protect our data from breach. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also damage our reputation or disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, and manage the administrative aspects of our business.\n\nPenalties for violations of these laws vary. For instance, penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly, and include significant civil monetary penalties and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm.\n\nFurther, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state afford greater protection to individuals than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective, we have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. Californiaâs patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. Similarly, the CCPA allows consumers a private right of action when certain personal information is subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft or disclosure due to a businessâ failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and data we receive, use and share, potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, for the treatment of genetic data, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products, decrease demand for our products, reduce our revenues and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\n\n53\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe may fail to comply with evolving privacy and data protection laws, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nNew privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the states in the U.S. and in the U.S. Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which trend may accelerate with increasing concerns about individual privacy. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the U.S. may make our compliance obligations more complex and costly, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, and may require us to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply.\n\nIn California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ), which became effective in 2020, broadly defines personal information, gives California residents expanded individual privacy rights and protections, provides for civil penalties for violations and gives California residents a private right of action for data breaches in certain cases. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (âCPRAâ), which became effective in 2023 and amends the CCPA, imposes additional obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also created a new California Privacy Protection Agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and is expected to result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The CPRA also extends the provisions of both the CCPA and the CPRA to the personal information of California-based employees. While there is an exception for certain health information, including protected health information that is subject to HIPAA, and clinical trial data, the CCPA may impact our business activities if we become a âBusinessâ regulated by the CCPA. Further, there continues to be some uncertainly about how certain provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and how some areas of the law will be enforced. We will continue to monitor developments related to the CCPA and anticipate additional costs and expenses associated with compliance. \n\nIn addition to the CCPA, broad consumer privacy laws recently went into effect in Virginia on January 1, 2023, in Colorado and Connecticut on July 1, 2023, and in Utah on December 31, 2023. New privacy laws will also become effective in Florida, Montana, Oregon and Texas in 2024, in Delaware, Iowa, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Tennessee in 2025, and in Indiana in 2026. In addition, numerous other states are considering new comprehensive privacy laws. \n\nOther U.S. states, such as New York and Massachusetts have enacted stringent data security laws and numerous other states have proposed similar laws. Additionally, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state affords greater protection to individuals than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective, we have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. Californiaâs patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. Similarly, as discussed above, the CCPA allows consumers a private right of action when certain personal information is subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft or disclosure due to a businessâ failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures.\n\nFurthermore, over the past few years, the number of privacy-related enforcement actions in the U.S., and in many cases the fines, have steadily increased. Failure to comply with these current and future laws, policies, industry standards, or legal obligations. or any data breach involving personal information, may result in government enforcement actions, litigation, fines, and penalties, private litigation, or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers, business partners, and investors to lose trust in us which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of our operations, and our financial condition. We continue to face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on our clinical trials and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law. \n\nThe interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and data we receive, use and share, potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, for the treatment of genetic data, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products, decrease demand for our products, reduce our revenues and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\n\n54\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn the European Union (âEUâ) and the United Kingdom (âUKâ), we may face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks in connection with requirements of EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ), the GDPR as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments incorporated into UK law on January 1, 2021 under the UK GDPR and other data protection requirements. The regulatory framework for collecting, using, safeguarding, sharing, transferring and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU and the subsequent separation of the data protection regimes of these territories means we are required to comply with separate data protection laws in the EU and the UK, which may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. Similar laws and regulations govern our processing of personal data, including the collection, access, use, analysis, modification, storage, transfer, security breach notification, destruction and disposal of personal data. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which took effect across all Member States of the European Economic Area (âEEAâ) on May 25, 2018, and as still in effect in the UK as the âUK GDPRâ. On June 28, 2021, the EU Commission adopted decisions on the UKâs adequacy under the EU GDPR, and the UK continues to operate under this adequacy decision. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU as well as to those outside the EU that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR imposes a broad range of data protection obligations on controllers and/or processors, as applicable, that must be complied with when processing personal data subject to the GDPR, including, for example, providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be âforgottenâ and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g., access requests); the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; limitations on retention of information; mandatory data breach notification requirements; safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data; restrictions on transfers of personal data outside of the EU to third countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections (such as the U.S.), and onerous new obligations and liabilities on services providers or data processors. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data are all classified as âspecial categoryâ data under the GDPR and afford greater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Further, the UK and EU member states have a broad right to impose additional conditionsâincluding restrictionsâon these data categories. This is because the GDPR allows EU member states to derogate from the requirements of the GDPR mainly in regard to specific processing situations (including special category data and processing for scientific or statistical purposes). Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to â¬20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater. Moreover, data subjects can claim damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. The GDPR further grants non-profit organizations and consumer organizations the right to bring claims on behalf of data subjects. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we may operate in. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual EU Member States. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any activities in the EU.\n\nFurther, as referenced above, following the UKâs withdrawal from the EU (i.e., Brexit), and the expiry of the Brexit transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, the EU GDPR has been implemented in the UK (as the UK GDPR). The UK GDPR sits alongside the UK Data Protection Act 2018 which implements certain derogations in the EU GDPR into UK law. Under the UK GDPR, companies not established in the UK but who process personal data in relation to the offering of goods or services to individuals in the UK, or to monitor their behavior will be subject to the UK GDPR â the requirements of which are (at this time) largely aligned with those under the EU GDPR and as such, may lead to similar compliance and operational costs. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to Â£17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. \n\nIn addition, we may be unable to transfer personal data from the EU, UK, and other jurisdictions to U.S. or other countries due to limitations on cross-border data flows. In particular, the EEA and the UK have significantly regulated the transfer of personal data to the U.S. and other countries whose privacy laws it believes are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and the UK to the U.S. in compliance with law, such as the EEA and UKâs standard contractual clauses and the newly-adopted Data Privacy Framework, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the U.S. If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK or other jurisdictions to the U.S., or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer \n\n55\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nare too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal data necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and the UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the U.S., are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups.\n\nIf we are investigated by an EEA or UK data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties, which could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by EEA, UK, or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products due to the potential risk exposure because of the current (and future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR and UK GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical partners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, many jurisdictions outside of the EEA and the UK are also considering and/or enacting comprehensive data protection legislation. For example, as of August 2020, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law imposes stringent requirements similar to GDPR with respect to personal information collected from individuals in Brazil.\n\nWe also continue to see jurisdictions imposing data localization laws. These regulations may interfere with our intended business activities, inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs.\n\nBecause the interpretation and application of many domestic and international privacy and data protection laws, commercial frameworks, and standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, frameworks, and standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices and policies. It is also possible that by complying with one law, we may be violating another. In addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, breach of contract claims, and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Failure to comply with current and future privacy and data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (including the imposition of significant penalties), criminal and civil liability for us and our officers and directors, private litigation and/or adverse publicity that negatively affects our business. Any inability to adequately respond to privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit our ability to conduct trials, and adversely affect our business.\n\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with potential future financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\n\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our stock incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.\n\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading**.**\n\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and collaborators. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, to provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices.\n\n56\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThese laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained during clinical studies that could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. \n\nThere may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially harm us**.**\n\nProper systems of internal control over financial accounting and disclosure are critical to the operation of a public company. We may be unable to effectively establish such systems, especially in light of the fact that we expect to operate as a publicly reporting company. This would leave us without the ability to reliably assimilate and compile financial information about us and significantly impair our ability to prevent error and detect fraud, all of which would have a negative impact on us from many perspectives. \n\nMoreover, we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, even if established, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systemâs objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us. \n\nThe estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial statements could prove inaccurate.\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot assure, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or otherwise prove inaccurate. Any potential litigation related to the estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial statements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, harm our business, and cause our share price to decline. \n\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, may not be subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in countries in which we conduct our business. However, our employees or other agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations**.**\n\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n57\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. \n\nWe maintain workersâ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. \n\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. \n\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or they publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline**.**\n\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. \n\nDelaware law contains anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders**.**\n\nProvisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make the acquisition of our company and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring us, without the consent of our board of directors, for at least three years from the date they first hold 15% or more of the voting stock. \n\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholdersâ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees**.**\n\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the U.S. of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholderâs ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\n\n58\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nITEM 2.

a Delaware corporation, formerly Acurx Pharmaceuticals, LLC (the âCompanyâ) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical\ncompany formed in July 2017, with operations commencing in February 2018. The Company is focused on developing a novel class of antibiotics that\naddress serious or life-threatening bacterial infections.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, a global pandemic. This outbreak caused\nmajor disruptions to businesses and markets worldwide as the virus continued to spread. Previously, the Companyâs clinical trial operations were directly\nand indirectly adversely impacted, and could continue to be directly and indirectly adversely impacted, by the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the\neffect on the Companyâs operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the\npandemic, and governmental, regulatory and private sector responses, direct and indirect economic effects as a result of inflation, supply chain disruptions\nand labor shortages all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Although the Company is unable to estimate the financial effect of the pandemic, at\nthis time, if the pandemic continues over a long period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on the Companyâs business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and cash flows. The financial statements do not reflect any adjustments as a result of the pandemic.\nIn February 2018, the Company purchased the active pharmaceutical ingredient, the intellectual property and other rights to an antibiotic product candidate\nknown as GLS362E (renamed ACX-362E and now approved for non-proprietary name, ibezapolstat) (the âAssetâ) from GLSynthesis, Inc. The Company\npaid $110,174 in cash, along with granting 100,000 Class B Membership Interests, profits interests as defined in the operating agreement, with an exercise\nprice of $0.10 per share. The Company was also required to make certain milestone payments totaling $700,000 in aggregate if certain milestones are\nachieved, $50,000 of which has already been paid by the Company and royalty payments equal to 4% of net sales for a period of time equal to the last to\nexpire of any applicable patents, as defined in the asset purchase agreement. The purchase of the Asset has resulted in our lead antibiotic product candidate,\nibezapolstat, which targets the treatment of C. difficile infections (âCDIâ).\nThe Companyâs primary activities since inception aside from organizational activities have included performing research and development activities\nrelating to the development of its two antibiotic candidates and raising funds through equity offerings including its initial public offering (âIPOâ)\nconsummated in June 2021. The Company has not generated any revenues since inception.\nThe Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the\nforeseeable future. The Company has needed to raise capital from sales of its securities to sustain operations. On June 29, 2021, the Company completed\nthe IPO, issuing 2,875,000 shares of common stock at a price of $6.00 per share, with gross proceeds of approximately $17.3 million. On July 27, 2022,\nthe Company completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement, issuing 1,159,211 shares of common stock and 130,769 pre-funded\nwarrants and Series A Warrants to purchase 1,289,980 shares of common stock and Series B Warrants to purchase 1,289,980 shares of common stock for\ngross proceeds of approximately $4.2 million. On May 18, 2023, the Company completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement,\nissuing 601,851 shares of common stock, 731,482 pre-funded warrants, Series C Warrants to purchase 1,333,333 shares of common stock and Series D\nWarrants to purchase 1,333,333 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $4.0 million. On November 15, 2023, the Company entered\ninto a Sales Agreement and established an âAt-the-Marketâ offering (the âATM Programâ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time\nto time through A.G.P/Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million.\nUnder the ATM Program, the Company sold a total of 2,692,190 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $9.0 million. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $5.8 million, which based on current estimates will not be sufficient to meet its\nanticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance of the condensed interim financial statements for the period ended September 30,\n2024. Management believes that the Company will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and will need additional resources to sustain its\noperations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever. Management plans to seek additional equity financing and grant funding, but\ncannot assure that such financing and funding will be available at acceptable terms, or at all. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companyâs\nability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from\nthe outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that the Companyâs research and development will be successfully completed or that any\nCompany product\n9\nTable of Contents\ncandidate will be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (âFDAâ) or any other worldwide regulatory authority or become commercially viable.\nThe Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biopharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative\narrangements, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary\ntechnology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements.\nNOTE 2 â SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (âGAAPâ) and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for\ninterim reporting. In the opinion of management, these unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal, recurring\nadjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the Companyâs financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The unaudited interim results of\noperations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may occur for the full fiscal year. The year-end condensed interim balance sheet data was\nderived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. Management believes that the disclosures provided\nherein are adequate when these unaudited condensed interim financial statements are read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes\nthereto as of December 31, 2023 filed in Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company estimates an annual effective tax rate of 0% as the Company incurred net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nresulting in an estimated net loss for both financial statement and tax purposes. Therefore, no current federal or state income tax expense has been recorded\nin the financial statements.\nBased on the Companyâs history of generating operating losses and its anticipation of operating losses for the foreseeable future, the Company has\ndetermined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits from those net operating losses would not be realized and a full valuation allowance against\nall deferred tax assets has been recorded. Should the Companyâs assessment change, tax benefits associated with the historic net operating loss\ncarryforwards could be limited due to future ownership changes.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company applied for a qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities in the amount of\n$51,127 and is included within the âOther Receivableâ on the accompanying condensed interim balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains the majority of its cash balance in one financial institution. The balance is insured up to the maximum allowable by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (âFDICâ). The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any\nsignificant risk of loss on cash. At times, the cash balance may exceed the maximum insured limit of the FDIC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company\nhad cash of approximately $5.8 million in U.S. bank accounts which was not fully insured by the FDIC.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company expenses research and development costs when incurred. At times, the Company may make cash advances for future research and\ndevelopment services. These amounts are deferred and expensed in the period the service is provided. The Company incurred research and development\nexpenses in the amount of $1,198,184 and $1,348,985 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $4,578,777 and\n$4,100,954 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCosts for certain research and development activities, such as the provision of services for clinical trial activity, are estimated based on an evaluation of the\nprogress to completion of specific tasks which may use data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to the Company by\nits vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ\nfrom the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as applicable. The\nestimates are adjusted to reflect the best information available at the time of the financial statement issuance. The Companyâs estimate of the status and\ntiming of services performed could differ from the actual status and timing of services performed.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for the cost of services performed by employees, directors and consultants received in exchange for an award of the Companyâs\ncommon stock or stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense based on the requisite\nservice period.\nCompensation expense associated with stock option awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the option at the grant\ndate determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including\nthe expected price volatility. The Companyâs employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes\nin the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value computation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Because there is no\npublic market for the Companyâs stock options and very little historical experience with the Companyâs stock, similar public companies were used for the\ncomparison of volatility and the dividend yield. The risk-free rate of return was derived from U.S. Treasury notes with comparable maturities.\nShare-Based Payments to Vendors\nThe Company accounts for the cost of services performed by vendors in exchange for an award of common stock, stock options, or warrants based on the\ngrant-date fair value of the award or the fair value of the services rendered, whichever is more readily determinable. The Company recognizes the expense\nin the same period and in the same manner as if the Company had paid cash for the services.\nMajor Vendor\nThe Company had three major vendors that accounted for approximately 44% of the research and development expenditures for the each of the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, and a major vendor that accounted for approximately 59% and 66% of the research and development expenditures\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were three vendors who accounted for approximately 65% of the total accounts payable and accrued expenses and as of\nDecember 31, 2023, these vendors accounted for 54% of the total accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nNOTE 3 â ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccrued research and development $ 2,968,508 $ 2,263,934\nAccrued compensation expenses 247,210 716,307\nAccrued professional fees 83,950 58,388\nOther accounts payable and accrued expenses 19,097 3,809\nTotal $ 3,318,765 $ 3,042,438\nNOTE 4 â ISSUANCE OF EQUITY INTERESTS\nOn June 23, 2021, Acurx Pharmaceuticals, LLC was converted into a corporation and renamed Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The Companyâs certificate of\nincorporation authorizes 200,000,000 shares of common stock of which 16,770,378 were outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOn May 16, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single healthcare-focused U.S. institutional investor named therein (the\nâ2023 Investorâ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold, in a registered direct offering by the Company directly to the 2023 Investor (the â2023\nRegistered Offeringâ), an aggregate of 601,851 shares of common stock at an offering price of $3.00 per share and an aggregate of 731,482 pre-funded\nwarrants exercisable for shares of common stock at an offering price of $2.9999 per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants sold to the 2023 Investor\nhave an exercise price of $0.0001 and were immediately exercisable. All of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in June 2023.\nThe gross proceeds to the Company from the 2023 Registered Offering were approximately $4.0 million and net proceeds after deducting the placement\nagentâs fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company were approximately $3.5 million.\nIn a concurrent private placement (the â2023 Private Placementâ and together with the 2023 Registered Offering, the â2023 Offeringsâ), the Company\nissued to the Investor Series C warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 1,333,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.26 per share and\nSeries D Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 1,333,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.26 per share. The Series C Warrants were\nexercisable commencing on November 18, 2023 and will expire on November 18, 2025. The Series D Warrants were exercisable commencing on\nNovember 18, 2023 and will expire on November 19, 2029.\nIn connection with the 2023 Offerings, the Company also entered into a Warrant Amendment Agreement with the 2023 Investor. Under the Warrant\nAmendment Agreement, the Company amended its existing Series A warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,230,769 shares of the common stock and\nSeries B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,230,769 shares of the common stock (collectively, the âExisting Warrantsâ) that were previously\nissued in July 2022, such that the amended Existing Warrants have a termination date of May 18, 2029. The Company used the Black-Scholes model to\ncalculate the change in the value of the aforementioned Series A and Series B Warrants attributable to the change in the termination date, with an estimated\nincrease in fair value of approximately $2.0 million. This amount was recorded as both an increase to additional paid-in capital and as a non-cash issuance\ncost of the 2023 offerings.\nIn January 2024, the Affiliate Investors exercised 59,211 of Series B Warrants which generated approximately $0.2 million in proceeds for the Company.\nThe following table summarizes information with respect to outstanding warrants to purchase common stock of the Company as of September 30, 2024:\nWeighted Average\nNumber of Warrants Exercise Price\nBalance at December 31, 2023 6,195,456 $ 3.28\nIssued â â\nExercised (59,211) 3.55\nBalance at September 30, 2024 6,136,245 $ 3.28\nThe weighted average contractual life of the outstanding warrants is 3.76 years.\nOn November 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement and established the ATM Program, pursuant to which the Company may offer and\nsell, from time to time through A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to\n$17.0 million.

Per the agreements, the Company issued a total of 120,000 shares of common stock, evenly over the four-month service period with grant date\nfair values ranging from $1.87 to $4.81, pursuant to the agreements and recorded general and administrative expenses of $0 and $329,700 for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into two separate agreements with consultants to provide investor relation services for six-month\nterms. The cash payments are expensed over the service period and the equity components are expensed consistent with the various contractual vesting\nperiods. Per the agreements, the Company will issue a total of 156,000 shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company issued a total of\n116,000 shares of common stock at grant date fair values ranging from $1.80 to $2.40, pursuant to the agreements and recorded general and administrative\nexpenses of $121,400 and $234,200 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nNOTE 7 â NET LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted net loss per shares of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was determined by dividing net loss by the\nweighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Companyâs potentially dilutive shares, consisting of 6,136,245 warrants and\n3,880,000 stock options, have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for all periods as the result would be antidilutive.\nNOTE 8 â COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nIn conjunction with the Asset purchase in February 2018, the Company is required to make certain milestone payments related to the ongoing development\nof ACX-362E totaling $700,000 in the aggregate if certain milestones are achieved (which includes $50,000 already paid after the acquisition in\nFebruary 2018). During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company achieved the Phase 2 clinical trial milestone and included $150,000 as a part of accounts\npayable and accrued expenses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is also obligated to make royalty payments equal to 4% of\nnet sales of ACX-362E for a period of time equal to the last to expire of any applicable patents, as defined in the purchase agreement.\n15\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENTâS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited\ncondensed interim financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes and the discussion under the heading âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operationsâ for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K (the â2023 Annual Reportâ) and filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) on March 15, 2024. This discussion, particularly information with respect to our future results\nof operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, includes forward-looking statements\nthat involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading âSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statementsâ in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q. You should review the disclosure under the heading âRisk Factorsâ in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of important\nfactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of small molecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial\ninfections. Our approach is to develop antibiotic candidates with a Gram-positive selective spectrum (âGPSSÂ®â) that block the active site of the Gram\npositive specific bacterial enzyme deoxyribonucleic acid (âDNAâ) polymerase IIIC (\"pol IIICâ), inhibiting DNA replication and leading to Gram-positive\nbacterial cell death. Our research and development (âR&Dâ) pipeline includes antibiotic product candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria, including\nClostridioides difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (âMRSAâ), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (âVREâ) and drug-resistant\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (âDRSPâ).\nThese bacterial targets are listed as priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (âWHOâ), the United States (âU.S.â) Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (âCDCâ) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (âFDAâ). Priority pathogens are those which require new antibiotics to\naddress the worldwide crisis of antimicrobial resistance (âAMRâ) as identified by the WHO, CDC and FDA.\nOur Market Opportunity\nThe CDC estimates that, in the U.S., antibiotic-resistant pathogens infect one individual every 11 seconds and result in one death every 15\nminutes. The WHO recently stated that growing antimicrobial resistance is equally as dangerous as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, threatens to unwind a\ncentury of medical progress and may leave us defenseless against infections that today can be treated easily. According to the WHO, the current clinical\ndevelopment pipeline remains insufficient to tackle the challenge of the increasing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.\nWe believe we are developing the first DNA pol IIIC inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical trials and our Phase 2 clinical trial has provided positive\nclinical trial results for our lead pol IIIC antibiotic candidate.\nPol IIIC is the primary catalyst for DNA replication of several Gram-positive bacterial cells. Our research and development pipeline includes\nclinical stage and early-stage antibiotic candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria for oral and/or parenteral treatment of infections caused by\nClostridioides difficile (âC. difficileâ), Enterococcus (including VRE), Staphylococcus (including MRSA), and Streptococcus (including antibiotic resistant\nstrains).\nPol IIIC is required for the replication of DNA in certain Gram-positive bacterial species. By blocking this enzyme, our antibiotic candidates are\nbelieved to be bactericidal and inhibit proliferation of several common Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including both sensitive and resistant C.\ndifficile, MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (âPRSPâ) and other resistant bacteria.\nWe expect to partner with a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company for late-stage clinical trials and commercialization or conduct Phase 3\nclinical trials prior to such partnership and continue to review partnership opportunities on an ongoing basis up to FDA approval.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOur lead antibiotic candidate, ibezapolstat (formerly named ACX-362E), has a novel mechanism of action that targets the pol IIIC enzyme, a\npreviously unexploited scientific target. A Phase 2 clinical trial, comprised of a Phase 2a segment and a Phase 2b segment, provided data that demonstrates\npositive clinical trial results for our lead antibiotic candidate and demonstrates pol IIIC as an appropriate bacterial target.\nOur Lead Product Candidate\nCurrently available antibiotics used to treat C. difficile infections (âCDIâ) utilize other mechanisms of action. We believe ibezapolstat is the first\nantibiotic candidate in late-stage clinical trials to work by blocking the DNA pol IIIC enzyme in C. difficile. This enzyme is necessary for replication of the\nDNA of certain Gram-positive bacteria, like C. difficile.\nOur Other Candidates\nWe also have an early-stage pipeline of antibiotic product candidates with the same previously unexploited mechanism of action, which has\nestablished proof of concept in animal studies. This pipeline includes ACX-375C, a potential oral and parenteral treatment targeting Gram-positive\nbacteria, including MRSA, VRE and PRSP.\nWe continue to evaluate strategic transactions for the Company, including a partner for the further development and potential commercialization\nof our lead antibiotic candidate, ibezapolstat, as well as a potential sale, merger, third-party licensing arrangement or other strategic transaction. At this\ntime, we have no commitments from potential partners or others to provide the Company with capital.\nRecent Developments\nOn September 26, 2024, we announced results from new analyses that extend data on the beneficial effects of ibezapolstat on the gut microbiome.\nThe data show an increased proportion of actinobacteriota and increased quantity of beneficial bacillota (firmicutes) leading to reversal of dysbiosis and\ncontributing to the CDI anti-recurrence effect of ibezapolstat. Microbiological testing of certain ACX-375 DNA pol IIIC analogues in independent\nqualified laboratories, including the University of Florida, demonstrated in vitro activity with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.5-2mcg/mL against\nB.anthracis, a Bioterrorism Category A pathogen including activity against ciprofloxacin resistant B. anthracis. These results were presented at the premier\nInternational C.difficile Symposium (âICDSâ) held in Bled, Slovenia in September 2024.\nOn September 24, 2024, we announced results from our pioneering research with ibezapolstat in collaboration with Leiden University Medical\nCenter. This detailed demonstration of the mode of action of DNA pol IIIC inhibitors in general, and for ibezapolstat specifically, is critically important to\nsupport our scientific foundation and our regulatory filings as we advance into this late-stage of ibezapolstat's development. These results were similarly\npresented at the ICDS held in September 2024.\nIbezapolstat Phase 2 Clinical Results\nOn November 2, 2023, we announced top-line results from the Phase 2b segment of our Phase 2 clinical trial of ibezapolstat in patients with CDI.\nIn the Phase 2b segment of the clinical trial, the observed Clinical Cure rate in the per protocol population was 15 of 16 patients (94%) in the ibezapolstat\narm and 14 out of 14 patients (100%) in the vancomycin arm, respectively. In the Phase 2a segment of the clinical trial that evaluated ibezapolstat in\npatients with CDI, the observed Clinical Cure rate in the per protocol population was 10 out of 10 patients (100%). In a post hoc analysis conducted with\nthe data available at the time of discontinuation of the trial, the overall observed Clinical Cure rate for ibezapolstat in the combined Phase 2a and Phase 2b\nsegments of the clinical trial in patients with CDI was 96% (25 out of 26 patients), based on 10 out of 10 patients (100%) in the Phase 2a segment in the\nper protocol population, plus 15 out of 16 (94%) patients in the Phase 2b segment We believe that, based on the post hoc pooled Phase 2 ibezapolstat\nClinical Cure rate of 96% and the historical vancomycin cure rate of approximately 81% (VancocinÂ® Prescribing Information, January 2021), Phase 3\ntrials conducted in accordance with the applicable FDA Guidance for Industry (October 2022) would be able to demonstrate the non-inferiority of\nibezapolstat to vancomycin, though there can be no assurance that these early-stage, Phase 2 data will predict results in Phase 3 clinical trials.\n17\nTable of Contents\nFurther analysis of the secondary and exploratory endpoints from the Phase 2b segment showed the following:\nâ 15 of 15 (100%) of the ibezapolstat-treated patients who achieved Clinical Cure (âCCâ) at end of treatment (âEOTâ) remained free of C. difficile\nInfection (âCDIâ) recurrence through one month after EOT, for a Sustained Clinical Cure (âSCCâ) rate of 100%. In the Phase 2a segment, 10 of\n10 (100%) of the ibezapolstat-treated patients who had achieved CC at EOT remained free of CDI recurrence through one month after EOT, for\nan SCC rate of 100%;\nâ 2 of 14 patients treated with standard of care, vancomycin, experienced recurrent infection within one month after EOT for a SCC of 86%;\nFor extended clinical cure, data also showed that 100% (5 of 5) of ibezapolstat-treated patients who agreed to observation for up to three months\nfollowing CC at EOT experienced no recurrence of infection;\nâ Additional microbiology and microbiome analysis of patients in the Phase 2b segment data showed that ibezapolstat outperformed vancomycin\nshowing eradication of fecal C. difficile at Day 3 of treatment in 15 of 16 treated patients (94%), versus vancomycin which had eradication of C.\ndifficile in 10 of 14 treated patients (71%); and\nâ Ibezapolstat, but not vancomycin, consistently preserved and allowed regrowth of key gut bacterial species believed to confer health benefits\nincluding to prevent recurrence of CDI.\nIbezapolstat was well-tolerated in the Phase 2 clinical trial. In the Phase 2b segment, there were three patients each experiencing one mild adverse\nevent assessed by the blinded investigator to be drug-related. All three events were gastrointestinal in nature and resolved without treatment. In the Phase\n2a segment, there were seven adverse events reported in four patients, with only one (nausea) likely related to ibezapolstat. One severe adverse event\noccurred (an exacerbation of a migraine headache) but was considered to be unrelated to ibezapolstat. There were no drug-related treatment withdrawals\nor no drug-related serious adverse events, or other safety findings of concern in either segment of the Phase 2 clinical trial.\nFurther analyses will be forthcoming regarding other exploratory endpoints from the Phase 2b segment of the Phase 2 clinical trial later this year.\nThe Company anticipates presenting data from the Phase 2 clinical trial at one or more scientific conferences throughout 2024.\nWe convened an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA on April 17, 2024 and announced on May 15, 2024 that we had a successful meeting,\nincluding confirmation of Phase 3 readiness for ibezapolstat for the treatment of C. difficile infection. Agreement with the FDA was reached on key\nelements to move forward with our international Phase 3 clinical trial program. Agreement was also reached with the FDA on the complete non-clinical\nand clinical development plan for filing of a New Drug Application (âNDAâ) for marketing approval. Planning continues to advance ibezapolstat into\ninternational Phase 3 clinical trials for treatment of C. difficile infection (âCDIâ). We are also now preparing to submit requests for guidance to initiate\nclinical trials in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada, as well as preparing for a manufacturing meeting with the FDA to be\nscheduled prior to Phase 3 enrollment.\nIn July 2024, we announced that a new patent has been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (âUSPTOâ). This patent relates\nto ibezapolstat and its use to treat C. difficile infection while reducing the recurrence of the infection, as well as improving the health of the gut\nmicrobiome. This is the latest in the series of granted patents and pending patent applications that we have filed to protect our proprietary technologies in\nthe field of antimicrobials.\nFollowing our successful End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA, which confirmed our Phase 3 clinical trial readiness, and per the FDA regulatory\nrequirements, in August 2024, we submitted our request to the FDA for a meeting to review our manufacturing processes and specifications for drug\nsubstance and final project and packaging (typically referred to as Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (âCMCâ)) for our Phase 3 clinical trials. We\nanticipate the FDA to grant a meeting in the fourth quarter.\n2023 At-the-Market Offering\nOn November 15, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established an âATM Programâ, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from\ntime to time through A.G.P/Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of our common stock having an\n18\nTable of Contents\naggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the Sales Agreement, the sales agent is entitled to compensation of 3.0% of the gross offering\nproceeds of all shares of common stock sold through it pursuant to the Sales Agreement.\nAs of the period ended September 30, 2024, we sold a total of 2,692,190 shares of our common stock under the ATM Program at a weighted-\naverage price of $3.35 per share, raising $9.0 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of $8.6 million, after deducting commissions to the sales agent\nand other ATM Program related expenses. As of November 11, 2024, total sales under the ATM Program since it was implemented in November 2023 are\napproximately $9.0 million out of the total $17 million ATM facility.\nThere remains approximately $8.0 million available for future sales of shares of common stock under the ATM Program.\nEffects of Coronavirus (COVID-19) on Our Business\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to\nevolve. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations or those of our collaborators, vendors, contractors, suppliers, clinical trial sites and other\nmaterial business relations and governmental agencies will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with\nconfidence, including the ultimate duration of the outbreak, new information that will emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain\nit or treat its impact, among others. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the ultimate duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic, have been, and\ncontinue to be, difficult to assess or predict, the spread of COVID-19 has caused a broad impact globally. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic\nmay impact our business continues to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at\nall.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTo date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to development of ibezapolstat, preclinical studies and other preclinical\nactivities related to our portfolio. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or\nservices to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received.\nResearch and development expenses include:\nâ external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (âCROsâ) and consultants to\nconduct our preclinical, toxicology and other preclinical studies;\nâ laboratory supplies;\nâ costs related to manufacturing product candidates, including fees paid to third-party manufacturers and raw material suppliers;\nâ license fees and research funding; and\nâ facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities,\ninsurance, equipment and other supplies.\nClinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors.\nWe outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities such as CROs, independent clinical investigators and other third-\nparty service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical trials.\n19\nTable of Contents\nWe plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product\ncandidates and seek to discover and develop new product candidates. Due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development,\nwe cannot determine with certainty the timing of the initiation, duration or costs of future clinical trials and preclinical studies of product candidates.\nClinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and the amount of development costs can differ materially from expectations. We\nanticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each\nproduct candidate or program on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory\ndevelopments and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidateâs commercial potential. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates\nmay be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our\ndevelopment plans and capital requirements.\nOur future clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:\nâ per-patient trial costs;\nâ the number of trials required for regulatory approval;\nâ the number of sites included in the trials;\nâ the countries in which the trials are conducted;\nâ the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;\nâ the number of patients that participate in the trials;\nâ the number of doses that patients receive;\nâ the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\nâ potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;\nâ the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;\nâ the phase of development of the product candidate; and\nâ the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel\nin our executive, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include facility-related costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property\nand corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services and insurance costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative\nexpenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities, pre-commercialization and, if any product candidates\nreceive marketing approval, commercialization activities. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services\nassociated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs\nassociated with operating as a public company.\n20\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table presents a summary of the changes in our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Percentage\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands)\nOPERATING EXPENSES:\nResearch and Development $ 1,198 $ 1,349 (11)%\nGeneral and Administrative 1,623 1,766 (8)%\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES 2,821 3,115 (9)%\nNet Loss $ (2,821) $ (3,115) (9)%\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.3 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $0.1 million primarily due to $0.1 million increase in manufacturing related costs offset by $0.2 million decrease\nin consulting fees.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.8 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $0.2 million.

The increase was primarily due to $1.1 million increase in professional fees and $0.2 million increase in\nlegal costs.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was $11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an\nincrease of $1.8 million, due to the reasons stated above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nSince inception, we have generated no revenue from operations and we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately $64.5 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. We have funded our operations primarily from equity issuances. We received net cash proceeds of approximately $12.9 million from\nequity financings closed between March 2018 and October 2020. On June 29, 2021, we completed our IPO resulting in net proceeds of approximately\n$14.8 million after deducting underwriter discounts of $1.4 million and offering costs of approximately $1.1 million. On July 27, 2022, we completed a\nregistered direct offering and concurrent private placement resulting in net proceeds of approximately $3.7 million after deducting placement agents fees of\n$0.3 million and offering costs of $0.2 million. On May 18, 2023, we completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement resulting\nin net proceeds of approximately $3.5 million after deducting placement agents fee of $0.2 million and offering costs of $0.2 million. On November 15,\n2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established the ATM Program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through\nA.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the ATM\nProgram, we raised net proceeds of approximately $8.6 million after deducting sales agent commissions and other related expenses of $0.4 million.\nBased upon our lack of revenue expected for the foreseeable future, and because of numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research,\ndevelopment and future commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and\noperating expenditures associated with our anticipated clinical trials and development activities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of $2.7 million, consisting primarily of $5.8 million of cash, $0.2 million of other receivable\nand prepaid expenses, offset by approximately $3.3 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nThe following table sets forth selected cash flow information for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash (used in)/provided by:\nOperating activities $ (8,133) $ (5,603)\nFinancing activities 6,421 3,544\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash $ (1,712) $ (2,059)\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net loss was greater than the net cash\nused in operating activities by $3.2 million, primarily attributable to share-based compensation and share-based vendor payments of $2.9 million and\nincrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.3 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss was greater than the net cash\nused in operating activities by $3.8 million, primarily attributable to share-based compensation and share-\n22\nTable of Contents\nbased vendor payments of $2.5 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.2 million and decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.1\nmillion.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided from financing activities was $6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily attributable to\nthe ATM Program.\nNet cash provided from financing activities was $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was attributable to the net\nproceeds from the registered direct offering.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur managementâs discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have\nbeen prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\nin our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and share-based\ncompensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent\nfrom other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, âSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,â we believe the\nfollowing accounting policies and estimates to be most critical to the preparation of our financial statements.\nResearch and Development\nWe expense research and development costs when incurred. At times, we may make cash advances for future research and development services.\nThese amounts are deferred and expensed in the period the services are provided.\nCosts for certain research and development activities, such as the provision of services for clinical trial activity, are estimated based on an\nevaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks which may use data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided\nto us by our vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which\nmay differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as\napplicable. The estimates are adjusted to reflect the best information available at the time of the financial statement issuance. Although we do not expect\nour estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our estimate of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual\nstatus and timing of services performed may vary.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for the cost of services performed by employees, directors and consultants received in exchange for an award of the Companyâs\ncommon stock or stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We recognize compensation expense based on the requisite service period.\nCompensation expense associated with stock option awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the option at\nthe grant date determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions\nincluding the expected price volatility. Our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in\nthe subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value computation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Because there is no public\nmarket for our stock options and very little historical experience with our stock, similar public companies were used for the comparison of volatility and\nthe dividend yield. The risk-free rate of return was derived from U.S. Treasury notes with comparable maturities. We will continue to analyze the expected\nstock price volatility and will adjust our Black-Scholes option pricing assumptions as appropriate. Any changes in the foregoing Black-Scholes\nassumptions, or if we were to elect to utilize an alternative method for valuing stock options granted to employees, officers and directors, could potentially\nimpact our stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations.\n23\nTable of Contents\nShare-Based Payments to Vendors\nWe account for the cost of services performed by vendors in exchange for an award of our common stock or stock options, based on the grant-date\nfair value of the award or the fair value of the services rendered, whichever is more readily determinable. We also use Black-Scholes option pricing model\nfor the purpose of estimating the fair value of options and warrants. Changes in our Black-Scholes assumptions, or if we were to utilize an alternative\nmethod for valuing options or warrants issued to our vendors, could impact our expense and our results of operations.\nOther Company Information\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the âJOBS Actâ). Under the JOBS Act,\ncompanies have extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected this exemption to delay\nadopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\nIn addition, we intend to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions\nset forth in the JOBS Act, we are entitled to rely on certain exemptions as an emerging growth company; we are not required to, among other things,\n(i) provide an auditorâs attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b), (ii) provide all of the\ncompensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit\nfirm rotation or a supplement to the auditorâs report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and\nanalysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion\nof our IPO or until we no longer meet the requirements of being an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the\ndisclosures required for income taxes. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The\namendment should be applied on a prospective basis while retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this\npronouncement on its disclosures.\n24\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain âdisclosure controls and procedures,â as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECâs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and\nprocedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or\nsubmit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management\nnecessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our\nprincipal financial officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management\nrecognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired\ncontrol objectives. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe can give no assurance that weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our failure to\nimplement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement\nof our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in managementâs evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-\n15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and\ninternal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable\nassurance level. However, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will\nprevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also\nis based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n25\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal\nproceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have\nan adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be carefully considered. The risks and\nuncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less\nsignificant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of some of the forward-\nlooking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nfuture growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. These risks include the\nfollowing:\nâ We are a clinical-stage company and have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and\npredict our future performance.\nâ We have incurred significant net losses in each period since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the\nforeseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nâ Our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nâ We may need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate\nour product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nâ Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our\ntechnologies or product candidates.\nâ We are reliant on the success of our lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, which we are developing for the treatment of CDI. If we are unable\nto commercialize ibezapolstat, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nâ If serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate, we may\nneed to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate.\nâ Ibezapolstat or our other product candidates may never achieve sufficient market acceptance even if we obtain regulatory approval.\nâ We are exposed to product liability, and non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us,\nshould lawsuits be filed against us.\nâ Our current and future operations substantially depend on our management team and our ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of\nwhom could disrupt our business operations.\nâ Our failure to complete or meet key milestones relating to the development of our technologies and proposed products and formulations\nwould significantly impair our financial condition.\nâ We will compete with larger and better capitalized companies, and competitors in the drug development or pharmaceutical industries may\ndevelop competing products which outperform or supplant our proposed products.\nâ A pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nâ Global market and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nâ Because results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we\nadvance may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Moreover, interim, âtop-line,â and preliminary\ndata from our clinical trials that we announce or publish may change, or the perceived product profile may be negatively impacted, as more\npatient data or additional endpoints (including efficacy and safety) are analyzed.\n26\nTable of Contents\nâ If clinical trials of our lead product candidate fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, or the European\nMedicines Agency (âEMAâ), or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in\ncompleting, or ultimately be unable to complete the development and commercialization of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate.\nâ If we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or\ncommercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nâ We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, be unable to commercialize our\nproduct candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nâ Risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our product development should we elect to extend\ndevelopment outside the U.S.\nâ Our results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and regulatory actions.\nâ If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product\ncandidates, we may not be successful in commercializing ibezapolstat or any other product candidate if and when such product candidates are\napproved.\nâ We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and our ongoing clinical trials, and expect\nto continue to do so for additional clinical trials and ultimately for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we\nwill not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or drugs or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or\nimpair our development or commercialization efforts.\nâ If ultimate users of our product candidates are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third- party payers, or if new restrictive\nlegislation is adopted, market acceptance of our proposed products may be limited and we may not achieve material revenues.\nâ We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents.\nâ Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nâ Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be\nyour sole source of gain.\nâ The price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nâ Our largest stockholders will exercise significant influence over our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters\nrequiring stockholder approval.\nâ Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nâ We may fail to comply with evolving privacy and data protection laws, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nâ There may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may\nmaterially harm us.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are a clinical-stage company and have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our\nfuture performance.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that was formed in July 2017. We acquired the rights to our lead product candidate,\nibezapolstat, in February 2018 and we have a limited operating history. Our operations to date have been limited to securing our initial product candidate,\ngenerating a second product candidate in-house, conducting clinical and regulatory development for our lead program and raising capital. We have no\nproducts approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue.\nInvesting in an early-stage company with limited history, financial or otherwise, includes a high degree of risk. As an early-stage company, our\nprospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of\noperations. We have generated losses since inception and we expect to continue to run at a loss for several years until our initial program, or one of our\npipeline products, is approved by the FDA or another worldwide regulatory body. We expect to incur substantial operating expenses over the next several\nyears as our product development activities and related\n27\nTable of Contents\ncosts increase. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully implement any or all of our business plan, or if implemented, that we will\naccomplish the desired objectives, including achieving profitability. Our short history as an operating company makes any assessment of our future success\nor viability subject to significant uncertainty. We will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving\nfields. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business will suffer.\nWe have incurred significant net losses in each period since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in for the foreseeable\nfuture and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred significant losses in each period since our inception, including net losses of $11.3 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We have not commercialized any products and have never\ngenerated any revenue from product sales. We expect these losses to increase as we continue to incur significant research and development and other\nexpenses related to our ongoing operations, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, scale-up manufacturing capabilities and hire additional\npersonnel to support the development of our product candidates and to enhance our operational, financial and information management systems.\nA critical aspect of our strategy is to invest significantly in our clinical and regulatory development for our lead program. To become and remain\nprofitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize products with significant market potential, which we may never achieve. Even if we succeed in\ncommercializing one or more of these product candidates, we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future relating to our substantial research and\ndevelopment expenditures to develop our product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other\nunknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses\nand our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholdersâ\nequity and working capital. Further, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, such that a period-to-\nperiod comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able\nto sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and\ncould impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our discovery and preclinical development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations and\nmay require us to raise additional capital that may dilute your ownership interest. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or\npart of your investment.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm noted in its report accompanying our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December\n31, 2023, that we had suffered significant accumulated deficit and had negative operating cash flows and that the development and commercialization of\nour product candidates are expected to require substantial expenditures. We have not yet generated any material revenues from our operations to fund our\nactivities, and are therefore dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in obtaining the\nnecessary financing to continue our operations. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we\ncannot successfully continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in our common stock.\nWe may need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our\nproduct development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue research and development and initiate\nadditional clinical trials of our product candidates and seek regulatory approval for these and potentially other product candidates. In addition, if we obtain\nregulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing,\nmarketing, sales and distribution. In particular, the costs that may be required for the manufacture of any product candidate that receives marketing\napproval may be substantial. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are\nunable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any\nfuture commercialization efforts.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $5.8 million in cash. In June 2021, we completed the IPO for net cash proceeds of $14.8 million\nafter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In July 2022, we completed a registered direct offering and concurrent\nprivate placement for net cash proceeds of $3.7 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. In May 2023, we completed a\nregistered direct offering and concurrent private placement for net cash proceeds of $3.5 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering\nexpenses. In November 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established an ATM Program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to\ntime through A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. As of\nthe period ended September 30, 2024, we sold a total of 2,692,190 shares of our common stock under the ATM Program, at a weighted-average price of\n$3.35 per share, raising $9.0 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of $8.6 million after deducting commissions to the sales agent and other ATM\nProgram related expenses. There remains approximately $8.0 million available for future sales of shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement. We\nbelieve that, based upon our current operating plan, our existing capital resources will not be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations for at least 12\nmonths from the issuance of our condensed interim financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024. Our future capital requirements and the\nperiod for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect. Our monthly spending levels vary\nbased on new and ongoing research and development and other corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with successful\nresearch and development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and\nany approved marketing and commercialization activities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nâ the timing, progress, and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates;\nâ our ability to manufacture sufficient clinical supply of our products candidates and the costs thereof;\nâ discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the design and conduct of our clinical trials and the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory\nreview of our product candidates;\nâ the cost and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our\nproduct candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\nâ the costs of any other product candidates or technologies we pursue;\nâ our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\nâ the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and\nâ the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and\ndefending any intellectual property-related claims.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our\nmanagement from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our ability to\nraise additional funding will depend on financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, over which we may have no or limited control,\nincluding the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. In addition, our ability to obtain future\nfunding when needed through equity financings, debt financings or strategic collaborations may be particularly challenging in light of the uncertainties and\ncircumstances regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in\nsufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our\nproduct candidates or other research and development initiatives. We could be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage\nthan otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our\nrights to our product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves.\n29\nTable of Contents\nAny of the above events could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our\ncommon stock to decline.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies\nor product candidates.\nUntil such time as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of\npublic and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships, and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional\ncapital through the sale of equity or debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that\nadversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve\nrestrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights\nand other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships\nand alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant\nlicenses on terms unfavorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that\nwe would otherwise develop and market ourselves.\nWe are reliant on the success of our lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, which we are developing for the treatment of CDI. If we are unable to\ncommercialize ibezapolstat, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which may not occur for several years, if ever, currently depends heavily on the successful development\nand commercialization of ibezapolstat. The success of ibezapolstat will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\nâ successful completion of clinical development;\nâ receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\nâ establishing commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\nâ obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;\nâ protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\nâ establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\nâ launching commercial sales of ibezapolstat, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\nâ acceptance of ibezapolstat, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\nâ effectively competing with other CDI therapies; and\nâ maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of ibezapolstat following approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to\nsuccessfully commercialize ibezapolstat, which would materially harm our business.\nIf serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate, we may need to\nabandon or limit our development of that product candidate.\nOur product candidates are in clinical development and its risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when our product candidates will\nprove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have\ncharacteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development\n30\nTable of Contents\nto certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-\nbenefit perspective.\nMany compounds that initially show promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects or other safety issues\nthat prevented further development. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects\nof such product candidate will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from such product candidate will be delayed or eliminated. Any of\nthese occurrences could materially harm our business.\nIbezapolstat or our other product candidates may never achieve sufficient market acceptance even if we obtain regulatory approval.\nIf ibezapolstat or any of our other future product candidates receive marketing approval, such products may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient\nmarket acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of\nacceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or revenue from collaboration agreements or any profits from operations. The degree of\nmarket acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\nâ the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments or competitive products;\nâ the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\nâ the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\nâ convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\nâ the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\nâ obtaining regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing;\nâ our ability to timely and effectively manufacture, market and distribute our products, either on our own or through third parties;\nâ pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and\nother health plan administrators;\nâ the timing of any such marketing approval in relation to other product approvals;\nâ support from patient advocacy groups;\nâ our ability to attract corporate partners, including pharmaceutical companies, to assist in commercializing our proposed formulations or\nproducts; and\nâ any restrictions on concomitant use of other medications.\nIf our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by the relevant constituencies, or adequate pricing, we may not generate significant\nproduct revenue and may not become profitable.\nWe are exposed to product liability, and non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us, should\nlawsuits be filed against us.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of\npharmaceutical formulations and products. We expect that such claims are likely to be asserted against us at some point, although we do carry product\nliability and clinical trial insurance to mitigate this risk. In addition, the use in our clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the\nsubsequent sale of these formulations or products by us or our potential\n31\nTable of Contents\ncollaborators may cause us to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current and future operations substantially depend on our management team and our ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of whom\ncould disrupt our business operations.\nOur business does and will depend in substantial part on the continued services of David P. Luci, Robert J. DeLuccia and Robert G. Shawah. The\nloss of the services of any of these individuals would significantly impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and result in the failure to\nreach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance on any member of our management, which would leave us uncompensated for the loss of any\nmember of our management.\nOur future financial condition and ability to achieve profitability will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified\npersonnel in the diverse areas required for continuing our operations. There is a risk that we will be unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified\npersonnel, both near term or in the future, and our failure to do so may severely damage our prospects.\nOur failure to complete or meet key milestones relating to the development of our technologies and proposed products and formulations would\nsignificantly impair our financial condition.\nIn order to be commercially viable, we must research, develop and obtain regulatory approval to manufacture, introduce, market and distribute\nformulations or products incorporating our technologies. For each drug that we formulate, we must meet a number of critical developmental milestones,\nincluding:\nâ demonstration of the benefit of each specific drug through our drug delivery technologies;\nâ demonstration, through non-clinical and clinical trials, that our drug delivery technologies are safe and effective; and\nâ establishment of a viable current good manufacturing process (âcGMPâ) capable of potential scale-up.\nThe estimated required capital and time frames necessary to achieve these developmental milestones is subject to inherent risks, many of which\nare beyond our control. As such, we may not be able to achieve these or similar milestones for any of our proposed product candidates or other product\ncandidates in the future. Our failure to meet these or other critical milestones would adversely affect our financial condition.\nConducting and completing the clinical trials necessary for FDA approval is costly and subject to intense regulatory scrutiny as well as the risk of\nfailing to meet the primary endpoint of such trials. We will not be able to commercialize and sell our proposed products and formulations without\ncompleting such trials.\nIn order to conduct clinical trials that are necessary to obtain approval by the FDA to market a formulation or product, it is necessary to receive\nclearance from the FDA to conduct such clinical trials. The FDA can halt clinical trials at any time for safety reasons or because we or our clinical\ninvestigators did not follow the FDAâs requirements for conducting clinical trials. If we are unable to receive clearance to conduct clinical trials or the trials\nare permanently halted by the FDA, we would not be able to achieve any revenue from such product as it is illegal to sell any drug or medical device for\nhuman consumption or use without FDA approval. Moreover, there is a risk that our clinical trials will fail to meet their primary endpoints, which would\nmake them unacceptable in having the subject product approved by the FDA. If this were to occur, such event would materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will compete with larger and better capitalized companies, and competitors in the drug development or pharmaceutical industries may develop\ncompeting products which outperform or supplant our proposed products.\nDrug companies and/or other technology companies have developed (and are currently marketing in competition with us), have sought to develop\nand may in the future seek to develop and market similar product candidates and drug delivery technologies which may become more accepted by the\nmarketplace or which may supplant our technology entirely. In addition, many of our current competitors are, and future competitors may be, significantly\nlarger and better financed than we are, thus giving them a significant advantage over us. Our competitors may also have significantly greater expertise in\nresearch and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products\nthan we do. These\n32\nTable of Contents\ncompetitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific advisors and consultants as well as management personnel and establishing\nclinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Other\nsmall or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established\ncompanies. We may be unable to respond to competitive forces presently in the marketplace which would severely impact our business.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth and expansion or implement our business strategies, in which case our business and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe expected growth of our business, if it occurs, will place increased demands on our management, operational and administrative resources.\nThese increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less effectively which, in turn, could cause a deterioration in\nour financial performance and negatively impact our growth. Any planned growth will also require that we continually monitor and upgrade our\nmanagement information and other systems, as well as our infrastructure.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our business and achieve our goals. Even if we succeed in establishing new strategic\npartnerships, we cannot assure that we will achieve planned revenue or profitability levels in the time periods estimated by us, or at all. If any of these\ninitiatives fails to achieve or is unable to sustain acceptable revenue and profitability levels, we may incur significant costs.\nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to\nevolve. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations or those of our collaborators, contractors, suppliers, CROs, clinical sites, contract\nmanufacturing organizations (âCMOsâ) and other material business relations and governmental agencies will depend on future developments, which are\nhighly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, new information that will emerge concerning\nthe severity of the virus and the actions to contain it or treat its impact, among others. Previously, our clinical trial operations were directly and indirectly\nadversely impacted, and could continue to be directly and indirectly adversely impacted, by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe spread of COVID-19 could also have adverse economic impacts to us. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of,\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, have been, and continue to be, difficult to assess or predict, the spread of COVID-19 has caused a broad impact globally.\nGlobal, market and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nThe results of our operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, the global financial markets and the global\npolitical conditions. The U.S. and global economies are facing growing inflation, higher interest rates and a potential recession. Furthermore, a severe or\nprolonged economic downturn, including a recession or depression resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or political disruption such as the war\nbetween Ukraine and Russia and the conflict involving Israel and Hamas could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for\nour programs and development candidates, if approved, relationships with any vendors or business partners located in affected geographies and our ability\nto raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy or political disruption, including any international trade\ndisputes, could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our\npotential products. Any of the foregoing could seriously harm our business, and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the political or economic\nclimate and financial market conditions could seriously harm our business.\nIncreases in inflation could raise our costs for commodities, labor, materials and services and other costs required to grow and operate our\nbusiness, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial condition. Additionally, increases in inflation, along with the\nuncertainties surrounding geopolitical developments and global supply chain disruptions, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic\nuncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment. A failure to adequately respond to these risks could have a material adverse impact on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In response to high levels of inflation and recession fears, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European\nCentral Bank, and the Bank of\n33\nTable of Contents\nEngland have raised, and may continue to raise, interest rates and implement fiscal policy interventions. Even if these interventions lower inflation, they\nmay also reduce economic growth rates, create a recession, and have other similar effects.\nThe U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a\nrecession in the U.S. Although U.S. lawmakers have previously passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, there is a history\nof ratings agencies lowering or threatening to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States given such uncertainty. On August 1, 2023,\nFitch Ratings downgraded the U.S.âs long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA as a result of these repeated debt ceiling and\nbudget deficit concerns. The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. governmentâs sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness\ncould adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions.\nIf the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary equity or debt financing more difficult to secure, more costly or more\ndilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could harm our growth strategy, financial performance and\nstock price and could require us to delay or abandon plans with respect to our business, including clinical development plans. Further, recent developments\nin the banking industry could adversely affect our business. If the financial institutions with which we do business enter receivership or become insolvent\nin the future, there is no guarantee that the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, will\nintercede to provide us and other depositors with access to balances in excess of the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit, that we would be able to access our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents and investments, that we would be able to maintain any required letters of credit or other credit support arrangements, or\nthat we would be able to adequately fund our business for a prolonged period of time or at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the impact that the high market volatility and instability of the banking sector\nmore broadly could have on economic activity and our business in particular. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers,\nmanufacturers or other third parties with which we conduct business may not survive difficult economic times, including the current global situation\nresulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, the instability of the\nbanking sector, and the uncertainty associated with current worldwide economic conditions, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating\ngoals on schedule and on budget.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows\nand prospects.\nWe believe that climate change has the potential to negatively affect our business and results of operations, cash flows and prospects. We are\nexposed to physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels), risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy (such as additional legal\nor regulatory requirements, changes in technology, market risk and reputational risk) and social and human effects (such as population dislocations and\nharm to health and well-being) associated with climate change. These risks can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).\nThe adverse impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as\nhurricanes, tornados, wildfires (exacerbated by drought), flooding, and extreme heat. Extreme weather and sea-level rise pose physical risks to our\nfacilities as well as those of our suppliers. Such risks include losses incurred as a result of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and\nbusiness interruption caused by such natural disasters and extreme weather events. Other potential physical impacts due to climate change include reduced\naccess to high-quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, which could impact future product development. These risks could disrupt our\noperations and supply chains, which may result in increased costs.\nNew legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the\nenvironment. These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could result in us being subject to new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes,\nincreased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency,\nupgrade of facilities to meet new building codes, and the redesign of\n34\nTable of Contents\nutility systems, which could increase our operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy used by us. Our supply chain would likely be subject\nto these same transitional risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to us.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and\nreimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive\ntreatments. Sales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product\ncandidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by\ngovernment health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is\navailable only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved\nreimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Moreover, increasing efforts by\ngovernmental and third-party payors, in the U.S. and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and\nlevel of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect\nto experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing\ninfluence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general has become very\nintense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nBecause results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance may\nnot have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Moreover, interim, âtop-line,â and preliminary data from our clinical\ntrials that we announce or publish may change, or the perceived product profile may be negatively impacted, as more patient data or additional\nendpoints (including efficacy and safety) are analyzed.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. The outcome of preclinical development testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of\nthe outcome of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are\noften susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in\npreclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidates. Once a product candidate has\ndisplayed sufficient preclinical data to warrant clinical investigation, we will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials\nthat our product candidates are effective with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in populations for their target indications before we can seek\nregulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Many drug candidates fail in the early stages of clinical development for safety and tolerability issues or for\ninsufficient clinical activity, despite promising pre-clinical results. Accordingly, no assurance can be made that a safe and efficacious dose can be found for\nthese compounds or that they will ever enter into advanced clinical trials alone or in combination with other product candidates. Moreover, success in early\nclinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate\nsufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Companies frequently experience significant setbacks in advanced\nclinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. There is an extremely high rate of failure of pharmaceutical candidates\nproceeding through clinical trials.\nIndividually reported outcomes of patients treated in clinical trials may not be representative of the entire population of treated patients in such\nstudies. In addition, larger scale Phase 3 studies, which are often conducted internationally, are inherently subject to increased operational risks compared\nto earlier stage studies, including the risk that the results could vary on a region to region or country to country basis, which could materially adversely\naffect the outcome of the study or the opinion of the validity of the study results by applicable regulatory agencies.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose top-line or preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then\navailable data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the\nparticular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of such data, and we may not have\nreceived or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data from the particular study or trial, including all endpoints and safety data. As a result,\ntop-line or preliminary results that we\n35\nTable of Contents\nreport may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have\nbeen received and fully evaluated. Top-line or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data\nbeing materially different from the topline, interim, or preliminary data we previously published. When providing top-line results, we may disclose the\nprimary endpoint of a study before all secondary endpoints have been fully analyzed. A positive primary endpoint does not translate to all, or any,\nsecondary endpoints being met. As a result, top-line and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available, including data\nfrom the full safety analysis and the final analysis of all endpoints.\nFurther, from time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that\nwe may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient\ndata become available. For example, time-to-event based endpoints such as duration of response and progression free survival have the potential to change,\nsometimes drastically, with longer follow-up. In addition, as patients continue on therapy, there can be no assurance given that the final safety data from\nstudies, once fully analyzed, will be consistent with prior safety data presented, will be differentiated from other similar agents in the same class, will\nsupport continued development, or will be favorable enough to support regulatory approvals for the indications studied. Further, others, including\nregulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the\nimportance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product\ncandidate or product and our company in general. The information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on\nwhat is typically extensive information, and regulators or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to\ninclude in our disclosure. If the interim, top-line or preliminary data that we report differ from final results, or if others, including regulatory authorities,\ndisagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which\ncould harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval\nIf clinical trials of our lead product candidate fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, or the EMA, or do not otherwise\nproduce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete the development and\ncommercialization of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate.\nIn connection with obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete extensive\nclinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement,\ncan take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of\npreclinical testing and early clinical trials, particularly with a small number of patients, may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and\ninterim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval\nof a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. We have limited\nexperience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval.\nMoreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believe their\nproduct candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or\ncommercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing\napproval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\nâ clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to\nconduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\nâ the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials\nmay be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n36\nTable of Contents\nâ we may be unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect any statistically\nsignificant treatment effects;\nâ our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or\nat all;\nâ regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical\ntrial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\nâ we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective\ntrial sites;\nâ we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are\nbeing exposed to unacceptable health risks;\nâ regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate\nclinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being\nexposed to unacceptable health risks;\nâ clinical trials are costly and the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\nâ the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be\ninsufficient or inadequate; and\nâ our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators,\ninstitutional review boards or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate the clinical trials.\nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical\ntests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial\ndelays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to\nbring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results\nof operations.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed\nor prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates, including our planned clinical trials of ibezapolstat, if we are\nunable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these clinical trials. CDI is an acute infection that requires rapid\ndiagnosis. For our clinical trials of ibezapolstat, we need to identify potential patients, test them for CDI and enroll them in the clinical trial within a 24-\nhour period. In addition, our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates, and\npatients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitorsâ product candidates. For our clinical\ntrials of ibezapolstat, we need to identify potential patients and enroll them in the clinical trial based on a history of diarrhea within 24 hours of a positive\nstool test for C. difficile toxin.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our\ncommon stock to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our planned clinical\ntrials of ibezapolstat would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\n37\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, be unable to commercialize our product\ncandidates and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development,\nmanufacturing, quality, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and\ndistribution of drugs. Rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials, and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be successfully\ncompleted in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory\nrequirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to a continuously evolving regulatory environment and unanticipated delays. It is possible\nthat none of the product candidates we may develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them.\nThe time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical\ntrials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. The standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when\nregulating companies such as ours are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Any analysis we perform of data from chemistry,\nmanufacturing and controls, preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay,\nlimit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from\nfuture legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory\nreview. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulations, guidance or interpretations will be\nchanged, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the particular product candidate\nfor which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which\nwe may market the product or the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy\n(âREMSâ) as a condition of approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or safe use of an approved drug, such as\nlimiting prescribing rights to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients as specially\ndefined by the indication statement or who meet certain safe-use criteria, and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry, among other requirements.\nThese limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and\nmarketing authorization, pricing and payment. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated\nwith FDA approval described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does\nnot ensure approval by comparable regulatory authorities outside of the United States and vice versa.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed drugs will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight. If we or our collaborators or contractors\nfail to comply with continuing U.S. and foreign requirements, our approvals, if obtained, could be limited or withdrawn, we could be subject to other\npenalties, and our business would be seriously harmed.\nFollowing any initial regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop, we will also be subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the\nreview of adverse drug experiences and safety data that are reported after our drug products are made commercially available. This would include results\nfrom any post-marketing studies or surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug product required as a condition of approval or agreed to by\nus. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which the product may\nbe marketed. Other ongoing regulatory requirements include, among other things, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports,\nregistration and listing, as well as continued maintenance of our marketing application, compliance with cGMP requirements and quality oversight,\ncompliance with post-marketing commitments, and compliance with good clinical practice (âGCPâ) for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.\nFailure to comply with these requirements could result in warning or untitled letters, criminal or civil penalties, recalls, or product withdrawals. In addition,\nwe are conducting our clinical trials and we intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in jurisdictions outside of the United States, and\ntherefore will be subject to, and must comply with, regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe FDA has significant post-market authority, including, for example, the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information\nand to require post-market studies or clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The FDA also has the authority to require a REMS plan after approval, which\nmay impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug.\nWe, our CMOs, and the manufacturing facilities we use to make our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing assessment of product\nquality, compliance with cGMP, and periodic inspection by the FDA and potentially other regulatory agencies. We or our CMOs may not be able to comply\nwith applicable cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our CMOs, to comply with\napplicable regulations could result in regulatory actions, such as the issuance of FDA Form 483 notices of observations, warning letters or sanctions being\nimposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or\nrecalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of\nour products. We may not have the ability or capacity to manufacture material at a broader commercial scale in the future. We and our CMOs currently\nmanufacture a limited supply of clinical trial materials. Reliance on CMOs entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured all of our\nmaterial ourselves, including reliance on the CMO for regulatory compliance. Our product promotion and advertising will also be subject to regulatory\nrequirements and continuing regulatory review.\nIf we or our collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements in the United\nStates or foreign jurisdictions in which we may seek to market our products, we or they may be subject to, among other things, fines, warning letters, holds\non clinical trials, refusal by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications,\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, refusal to permit the import or export of products, operating restrictions,\ninjunction, consent decree, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nOur product candidates for which we obtain approval may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nEven if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate ahead of our competitors, our future\npharmaceutical products may face direct competition from generic and other follow-on drug products. Any of our product candidates that may achieve\nregulatory approval in the future may face competition from generic products earlier or more aggressively than anticipated, depending upon how well such\napproved products perform in the U.S. prescription drug market. Our ability to compete may also be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party\npayors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (âFDCAâ) authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are\nthe same as drugs previously approved for marketing under the NDA provisions of the statute pursuant to abbreviated new drug applications (âANDAsâ),\nand also created the Section 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. An ANDA relies on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a previously approved reference\nlisted drug and must demonstrate to the FDA that the generic drug product is identical to the reference listed drug (âRLDâ) with respect to the active\ningredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug and also that it is âbioequivalentâ to the reference listed drug. In\ncontrast, Section 505(b)(2) enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDAâs prior findings of safety and efficacy data for an existing product, or\npublished literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) provides an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new\nuses of previously approved products; for example, a follow-on applicant may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new\nindications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. Such products, if approved and\ndepending upon the scope of the changes made to the reference drug, may also compete with any product candidates for which we receive approval.\nThe FDA is prohibited by statute from approving an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA when certain marketing or data exclusivity protections apply to the\nreference listed drug. However, if any competitor or third party is able to demonstrate bioequivalence without infringing our patents, then such competitor\nor third party may then be able to gain approval of an ANDA and introduce a competing generic product onto the market.\nFurthermore, the CREATES Act established a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to\ncompel it to furnish necessary samples of an RLD on âcommercially reasonable, market-based terms.â If generic developers request samples of any\nproduct candidates for which we receive marketing approval in order to conduct comparative testing to support one or more ANDAs for a generic version\nof our products, and we refuse any such request, we may be subject to litigation under the CREATES Act. Although lawsuits have been filed under the\nCREATES Act since its enactment, those\n39\nTable of Contents\nlawsuits have settled privately; therefore, to date, no federal court has reviewed or opined on the statutory language and there continues to be uncertainty\nregarding the scope and application of the law.\nWe cannot predict the interest of potential follow-on competitors or how quickly others may seek to come to market with competing products,\nwhether approved as a direct ANDA competitor or as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA referencing one of our future product candidates. If the FDA approves\ngeneric versions of any of our products in the future, should they be approved for commercial marketing, such competitive products may be able to\nimmediately compete with us in each indication for which our product has received approval, which could negatively impact our future revenue,\nprofitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on our investments.\nRisks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our product development should we elect to extend development\noutside the U.S.\nShould we elect to extend development outside the U.S., we may be subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. Risks associated with\nconducting operations in foreign countries include:\nâ¢ differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries; more stringent privacy requirements\nfor data to be supplied to our operations in the United States, e.g., GDPR in the EU;\nâ¢ unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in\nparticular foreign economies and markets; compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling\nabroad; foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\nâ¢ differing payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price controls;\nâ¢ foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing\nbusiness or operating in another country;\nâ¢ workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\nâ¢ continued uncertainties related to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU (known as âBrexitâ) and its financial, trade, regulatory and legal\nimplications, which could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to\nreplace or replicate, and which may further create global economic uncertainty, which could materially adversely affect our business, business\nopportunities, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows;\nâ¢ production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad, including those that may result\nfrom the recent coronavirus outbreak; and\nâ¢ business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and regulatory actions.\nLegislative and regulatory actions affecting government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently.\nIn the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the âACAâ) was enacted in 2010 to expand healthcare coverage. Since then, numerous efforts\nhave been made to repeal, amend or administratively limit the ACA in whole or in part. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other\nthings, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are\ninhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate\nProgram and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of\ncertain branded prescription drugs, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. We expect that future changes or additions to the\nACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access,\nfinancing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry in the United States. Complying with any\nnew legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in\n40\nTable of Contents\nexisting requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing\napproval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, on December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 was signed into law (P.L. 116-94) and includes a piece\nof bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 (the âCREATES Actâ). The CREATES Act\naims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the\ndistribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic product developers access to samples of\nbrand products. Because generic product developers need samples of a reference listed drug, to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA,\nsome have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act\nestablishes a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples\non âcommercially reasonable, market-based terms.â Whether and how generic product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely\noutcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on any of our future commercial\nproducts are unknown.\nFor a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government\nagencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The maximum amount that a\nmanufacturer may charge a 340B covered entity for a given product is the average manufacturer price (âAMPâ), reduced by the rebate amount paid by the\nmanufacturer to Medicaid for each unit of that product. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing,\nalthough, under the current state of the law, with the exception of childrenâs hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted\n340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid\nrebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.\nMoreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which\nhas resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more\ntransparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program\nreimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020\nincorporated extensive healthcare provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drug products covered\nunder Medicare Part B report the productâs average sales price to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (âCMSâ) beginning on January 1, 2022,\nsubject to enforcement via civil money penalties. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (âDHHSâ) has also solicited feedback on various\nmeasures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drugs and has implemented others under its existing authority.\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed into the law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the âIRAâ). The IRA has multiple provisions that may\nimpact the prices of drug products that are both sold into the Medicare program and throughout the United States. Starting in 2023, a manufacturer of a\ndrug or biological product covered by Medicare Parts B or D must pay a rebate to the federal government if the drug productâs price increases faster than\nthe rate of inflation. This calculation is made on a drug product by drug product basis and the amount of the rebate owed to the federal government is\ndirectly dependent on the volume of a drug product that is paid for by Medicare Parts B or D. Additionally, starting in payment year 2026, CMS will\nnegotiate drug prices annually for a select number of single source Part D drugs without generic or biosimilar competition. CMS will also negotiate drug\nprices for a select number of Part B drugs starting for payment year 2028. If a drug product is selected by CMS for negotiation, it is expected that the\nrevenue generated from such drug will decrease. CMS has begun to implement these new authorities and entered into the first set of agreements with\npharmaceutical manufacturers to conduct price negotiations in October 2023. However, the IRAâs impact on the pharmaceutical industry in the United\nStates remains uncertain, in part because multiple large pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders (e.g., the U.S. Chamber of Commerce) have\ninitiated federal lawsuits against CMS arguing the program is unconstitutional for a variety of reasons, among other complaints. Those lawsuits are\ncurrently ongoing.\nIn addition, many states have proposed or enacted legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing, such as by\nrequiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling on pharmaceutical\nproducts purchased by state agencies. For example, in recent years, several states have formed prescription drug affordability boards (âPDABsâ). Much\nlike the IRAâs drug price negotiation program, these PDABs have attempted to implement upper payment limits (âUPLsâ) on drugs sold in their respective\nstates in both public and commercial health\n41\nTable of Contents\nplans. In August 2023, Coloradoâs PDAB announced a list of five prescription drugs that would undergo an affordability review. The effects of these efforts\nremain uncertain pending the outcomes of several federal lawsuits challenging state authority to regulate prescription drug payment limits. In December\n2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the statesâ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers\n(âPBMsâ) and other members of the healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive\nefforts by states in this area. The Federal Trade Commission (âFTCâ) in mid-2022 also launched sweeping investigations into the practices of the PBM\nindustry that could lead to additional federal and state legislative or regulatory proposals targeting such entitiesâ operations, pharmacy networks, or\nfinancial arrangements. Significant efforts to change the PBM industry as it currently exists in the U.S. may affect the entire pharmaceutical supply chain\nand the business of other stakeholders, including pharmaceutical product developers like us.\nChanges to the Medicaid program at the federal or state level could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Proposals that could\nimpact coverage and reimbursement of our products, including giving states more flexibility to manage drugs covered under the Medicaid program and\npermitting the re-importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries, could have a material adverse effect by limiting our productsâ use\nand coverage. Furthermore, state Medicaid programs could request additional supplemental rebates on our products as a result of an increase in the federal\nbase Medicaid rebate. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, they could use\nthe enactment of these increased rebates to exert pricing pressure on our products, and the adverse effects may be magnified by their adoption of lower\npayment schedules.\nOther proposed regulatory actions affecting manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is difficult to predict the\nimpact, if any, of any such proposed legislative and regulatory actions or resulting state actions on the use and reimbursement of our products in the U.S.,\nbut our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we\nmay not be successful in commercializing ibezapolstat or any other product candidate if and when such product candidates are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale or marketing of pharmaceutical products. To achieve\ncommercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. If\nibezapolstat receives marketing approval, we intend to commercialize it in the U.S. with our own focused, specialized sales force. We plan to evaluate the\npotential for utilizing additional collaboration, distribution and marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize ibezapolstat in other\njurisdictions where we retain commercialization rights. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering\ninto arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and\ncould delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is\ndelayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and\nour investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\nâ our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\nâ the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\nâ the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors\nwith more extensive product lines; and\nâ unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales and marketing services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product\nrevenues will likely be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering\ninto arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may\n42\nTable of Contents\nbe unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the\nnecessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on\nour own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and our ongoing clinical trials, and expect to\ncontinue to do so for additional clinical trials and ultimately for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not\nhave sufficient quantities of our product candidates or drugs or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our\ndevelopment or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture supplies of our product candidates for use in development and\ncommercialization. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the production of our product candidates for preclinical studies\nand clinical trials under the guidance of members of our organization. We do not have long-term supply agreements. Furthermore, the raw materials for our\nproduct candidates are sourced, in some cases, from a single-source supplier although other sources are available. For example, drug substance and drug\nproduct are sourced from our principal supplier, Piramal Pharma Solutions, in Ennore, India and Ahmedabad, India, respectively. Chemical raw materials\nused for drug substance manufacture are sourced locally in India and are generally available. Accordingly, we do not anticipate difficulties sourcing drug\nsubstance for our clinical trials or, if FDA approved, for our marketing period, but we have not yet sourced a backup supplier because we currently have\nsufficient supply to complete our Phase 2b clinical trial. We are considering U.S. sources of drug substance for the commercial period if ibezapolstat is\nFDA approved and we anticipate several manufacturing options will be available. If we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of any of our\nproduct candidates or any of our future product candidates for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we\ncould experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials.\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product candidates for which we obtain\nmarketing approval. We may be unable to maintain or establish required agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if\nwe are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\nâ the failure of the third party to manufacture our product candidates according to our schedule, or at all, including if our third-party\ncontractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform\naccording to the terms of the agreements between us and them;\nâ the reduction or termination of production or deliveries by suppliers, or the raising of prices or renegotiation of terms;\nâ the termination or nonrenewal of arrangements or agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\nâ the breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them;\nâ the failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;\nâ the failure of the third party to manufacture our product candidates according to our specifications;\nâ the mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being\nproperly identified;\nâ clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to\ncommercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and\nâ the misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nWe do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for\ncompliance with cGMP regulations for manufacturing both active drug substances and finished drug\n43\nTable of Contents\nproducts. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the U.S. If our\ncontract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA,\nEMA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain marketing approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we do not have control\nover the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA, EMA or a\ncomparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such\napproval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing\napproval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable\nregulations could subject us and our third-party manufacturers to warning letters or other enforcement-related letters, holds on clinical trials or could result\nin further sanctions being imposed on us or our third-party manufacturers, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of\napprovals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could\nsignificantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates or drugs and harm our business and results of operations. Our current and anticipated\nfuture dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or drugs may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to\ncommercialize any product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on third party clinical investigators, contract research organizations (âCROsâ), clinical data management organizations and consultants to\ndesign, conduct, supervise and monitor preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. Because we rely on third parties and do not have the\nability to conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials independently, we have less control over the timing, quality and other aspects of preclinical studies\nand clinical trials than we would if we conducted them on our own. These investigators, CROs and consultants are not our employees and we have limited\ncontrol over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. These third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities,\nsome of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from our programs. Further, these third parties may not be diligent, careful or\ntimely in conducting our preclinical studies or clinical trials, resulting in the preclinical studies or clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful.\nIf we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third parties do not carry out their\ncontractual duties, satisfy legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical studies or clinical trials or meet expected deadlines, our\npreclinical and clinical development programs could be delayed and otherwise adversely affected. In all events, we are responsible for ensuring that each of\nour preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. The FDA and other\nhealth authorities require preclinical studies to be conducted in accordance with GLP and clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with GCP, including\nconducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights,\nintegrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. If we or our CROs fail to comply with these requirements, the data generated in our\nclinical trials may be deemed unreliable or uninterpretable and the FDA may require us to perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Our\nreliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Any such event could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf ultimate users of our product candidates are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third- party payers, or if new restrictive legislation is\nadopted, market acceptance of our proposed products may be limited and we may not achieve material revenues.\nThe continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs to contain\nor reduce costs of healthcare may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers\nand collaborative partners and the availability of capital. For example, in the U.S., given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering\nthe total cost of healthcare, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription\npharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals\nwill be adopted, the announcement or adoption of such proposals and related laws, rules and regulations could materially harm our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations or stock price. Moreover, the passage of the ACA in 2010, and efforts to amend or repeal such law, has created significant\nuncertainty relating to the scope of government regulation of healthcare and related legal and regulatory requirements, which could have an adverse impact\non sales of our products.\nMoreover, our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the\ncost of such products and related treatments are obtained by governmental authorities, private health\n44\nTable of Contents\ninsurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Consumers and third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical drugs and\nservices. Also, the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S. and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or\nsignificantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and drugs, as well as legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce government insurance\nprograms, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our proposed products.\nOur relationships with future customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws\nand regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and\nfuture earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates\nfor which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and\nabuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would\nmarket, sell and distribute our products. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and may not control referrals of healthcare services or bill\ndirectly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patientsâ\nrights are and will be applicable to our business. These regulations include:\nâ the Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering,\nreceiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an\nindividual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare\nprogram such as Medicare and Medicaid, and which will constrain our marketing practices and the marketing practices of our licensees,\neducational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities;\nâ the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or\nMedicaid patients to providers of âdesignated health servicesâ with whom the physician or a member of the physicianâs immediate family has\nan ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies;\nâ federal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented,\nclaims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent, and which may\nexpose entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers to potential criminal and civil penalties, including through civil\nwhistleblower or qui tam actions, and including as a result of claims presented in violation of the Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute,\nthe Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA;\nâ the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (âHIPAAâ), which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a\nscheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying,\nconcealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for\nhealthcare benefits, items or services that, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also\nimposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of\nindividually identifiable health information;\nâ federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA which requires manufacturers of approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical\nsupplies to report annually to the HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers,\nand teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family\nmembers and applicable group purchasing organizations;\nâ the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which, among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers\nfrom marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and\n45\nTable of Contents\nâ state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or\nmarketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including\nprivate insurers, state laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industryâs voluntary compliance\nguidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and which may require drug manufacturers to report\ninformation related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state\nand foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other\nin significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws such as HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve\nsubstantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes,\nregulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any\nof these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties,\ndamages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or\nrestructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in\ncompliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded\nhealthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we or our collaborators may be required to file infringement\nlawsuits that can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one of our patents is not valid, is\nunenforceable and/or is not infringed, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover\nthe technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or\ninterpreted narrowly and could put any pending applications at risk of being interpreted narrowly and of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings or derivation proceedings may be filed to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent\napplications or those of our licensors (if any). An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights\nfrom the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. We may not\nbe able to prevent, alone or with our licensors (if any), misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and in countries where the laws\nmay not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S. Other proceedings, such as proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Patent Trial and\nAppeal Board, filed by a third party may result in the invalidation of one or more of our patents.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some\nof our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results\nof hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, regardless of their merit, would cause us\nto incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In the event of a successful\nclaim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneysâ fees for willful infringement, in\naddition to paying royalties, redesign infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial\ntime and monetary expenditure. A court may also issue an injunction against us preventing us from manufacturing and bringing our products to market. In\naddition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or\ninvestors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such\n46\nTable of Contents\nlitigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales,\nmarketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of\nour competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources.\nUncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the\nmarketplace.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that is important or necessary to the development or commercialization of our\nproducts. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would\nbe required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. Such\nlicenses may not be available which could prevent us from commercializing our products. Further, if we are alleged to infringe third party intellectual\nproperty rights, we could face costly litigation, the outcome of which could negatively affect or prevent us from commercializing or developing our\nproducts. In the event of an adverse decision against us in a litigation, we could be required to: pay substantial damages and license fees, or even be\nprevented from using or commercializing our technologies and methods; and also be prevented from further research and development efforts. In such\ncase, we may be unable to develop alternative non-infringing products or methods and unable to obtain one or more licenses from third parties.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our rights to intellectual property or secure rights to third-party patents, we may lose valuable rights,\nexperience reduced market share, assuming any, or incur costly litigation to enforce, maintain or protect such rights.\nOur ability to license, obtain, enforce and maintain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights\nof others is important to the commercialization of any formulations or products under development. The patent positions of biotechnology and\npharmaceutical companies, including ours, are frequently uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a\npatent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, our patents, patent applications and other intellectual property\nrights may not provide protection against competitive technologies or products or may be held invalid if challenged or could be circumvented. Our\ncompetitors may also independently develop products similar to ours or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to, or licensed by, us. In\naddition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. law. Any of these occurrences would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant\nexpenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements\nof the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating\nlosses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other\nresources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings\nmore effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, costs and lost management time, as well as uncertainties resulting\nfrom the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the\nmarketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we will also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how,\ntechnology and other proprietary and confidential information, to maintain our competitive position. We will seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by\nentering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside\nscientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that we will have executed\nthese agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we do execute will provide adequate\nprotection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement could breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary or confidential\ninformation, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally\ndisclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some\n47\nTable of Contents\ncourts inside and outside the U.S. are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or\nindependently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or\ninformation to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, particularly unpatented know-how, were to be obtained or independently developed by a\ncompetitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole\nsource of gain.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the growth and\ndevelopment of our business and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our\ncommon stock will provide a return to our members.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our\nstockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management. The existence of these\nprovisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for\nshares of our common stock. Furthermore, we have the authority to issue shares of our preferred stock without further stockholder approval, the rights of\nwhich will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a âpoison pillâ to dilute the stock ownership of a\npotential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our board of directors does not approve. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws\ncontain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nâ our authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain\ncontrol of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise;\nâ our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed\nfrom office for cause;\nâ our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and will not be able to take action by written consent for any\nmatter, except in certain circumstances;\nâ a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors or a majority of our board of directors;\nâ advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual\nmeeting of stockholders; and\nâ certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and any amendments to our bylaws by our stockholders will require the approval of at\nleast two-thirds of our then-outstanding voting power entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe are an âemerging growth company,â and a âsmaller reporting companyâ and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable\nto emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an âemerging growth company,â as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to\ntake advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies,\nincluding:\nâ being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim condensed financial\nstatements, with correspondingly reduced âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsâ\ndisclosure in this Form 10-Q;\nâ not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\nâ reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\nâ exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of\nany golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our\ncommon stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the\ncompletion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC\nrules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by\nnon-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt\nsecurities during the prior three-year period.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards\napply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the extended transition period for adopting new or revised accounting standards under the\nJOBS Act as an emerging growth company. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with\npublic company effective dates.\nWe are also a smaller reporting company, and we will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year following the determination that\nour voting and non-voting shares of common stock held by non-affiliates is more than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal\nquarter, or our annual revenues are less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting shares of common\nstock held by non-affiliates is more than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.\nSimilar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations, such as an exemption from providing\nselected financial data and an ability to provide simplified executive compensation information and only two years of audited financial statements.\nThe price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section and\nmany others beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this âRisk Factorsâ section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our 2023\nAnnual Report, these factors include:\nâ the commencement, enrollment, completion or results of our current Phase 2b clinical trial of ibezapolstat;\n49\nTable of Contents\nâ any delay in our regulatory filings for ibezapolstat or our future product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse\ndevelopment with respect to the applicable regulatory authorityâs review of such filings, including without limitation the FDAâs issuance of a\nârefusal to fileâ letter or a request for additional information;\nâ adverse results or delays, suspensions or terminations in future preclinical studies or clinical trials;\nâ our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\nâ adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate or the failure of a\nregulatory authority to accept data from preclinical studies or clinical trials conducted in other countries;\nâ changes in laws or regulations applicable to ibezapolstat or any other product candidate, including but not limited to clinical trial\nrequirements for approvals;\nâ adverse developments concerning our manufacturers;\nâ our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\nâ our inability to establish collaborations, if needed;\nâ our failure to commercialize our product candidates, if approved;\nâ additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\nâ unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate;\nâ introduction of new products or services offered by us or our competitors;\nâ announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\nâ our ability to effectively manage our growth;\nâ actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\nâ our cash position;\nâ our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\nâ publication of research reports about us or our industry, or product candidates in particular, or positive or negative recommendations or\nwithdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\nâ changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\nâ changes in the structure of the healthcare payment systems;\nâ overall performance of the equity markets;\nâ sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\nâ trading volume of our common stock;\n50\nTable of Contents\nâ changes in accounting practices;\nâ ineffectiveness of our internal controls;\nâ disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection\nfor our technologies;\nâ significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\nâ general political, economic and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control, such as military conflict between Russia and\nUkraine as well as the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas; and\nâ other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life\nsciences company stocks. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks often does not relate to the operating\nperformance of the companies represented by the stock. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the\nprice of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our\nstock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon\nas an indication of our future performance.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type\nof litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managementâs attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments\nto satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nOur largest stockholders will exercise significant influence over our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring\nstockholder approval.\nOur officers, directors and their affiliates currently collectively own 5,105,432 shares of our common stock (on an as-converted basis) or\napproximately 26% of our outstanding shares of common stock (on an as-converted basis) as of September 30, 2024. Accordingly, if these stockholders\nwere to choose to act together, they could have a significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors\nand approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or all or a significant percentage of our assets. This\nconcentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from\nacquiring control over us.\nWe cannot assure you that the interests of our officers, directors and affiliated persons will coincide with the interests of the investors. So long as\nour officers, directors and affiliated persons collectively controls a significant portion of our common stock, these individuals and/or entities controlled by\nthem, will continue to collectively be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your\nability to have any control over our company.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investorsâ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us\nto additional trading restrictions.\nShould we fail to satisfy the Nasdaqâs continued listing requirements, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid\nprice requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common\nstock, and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to\nrestore our compliance with Nasdaqâs listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common\nstock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below\nNasdaqâs minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with the Nasdaqâs listing requirements.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIf Nasdaq does not maintain the listing of our securities for trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences,\nincluding:\nâ a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\nâ reduced liquidity for our common stock;\nâ a determination that our common stock is a âpenny stockâ which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more\nstringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\nâ a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\nâ a decreased ability to issue additional common stock or obtain additional financing in the future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert managementâs attention and affect our ability to attract and retain\nqualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing\nrequirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased, and will likely\ncontinue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems and resources. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are\ncreating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws,\nregulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice\nmay evolve over time. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters, higher administrative expenses and a diversion of\nmanagementâs time and attention. Further, if our compliance efforts differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities\nrelated to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. Being a public company that is subject\nto these rules and regulations also make it more expensive for us to obtain and retain director and officer liability insurance and we may in the future be\nrequired to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain or retain adequate coverage. These factors could also make it more\ndifficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers.\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third\nparties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or\ninfrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential\ndata. As an early-stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that\nany of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material and could exceed the limits of the cybersecurity insurance we\nmaintain, if any, against such risks. If the information technology systems of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants become subject\nto disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and may have to expend significant resources to mitigate\nthe impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.\nWe cannot assure you that our data protection efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in our systems, or those of our\nthird-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business,\noperations, or financial condition. For example, if such an event were to occur and cause\n52\nTable of Contents\ninterruptions in our operations, or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, it could result in a material disruption of our\nprograms and the development of our services and technologies could be delayed. Furthermore, significant disruptions of our internal information\ntechnology systems or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or security breaches could result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other\nintellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information), which could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to\nus. For instance, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our\ncustomers or employees, could harm our reputation directly, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law\nequivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security\nof personal information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse\neffect on our business.\nAlthough we take measures to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure\nmay be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to personnel error, malfeasance, or other malicious or inadvertent disruptions. Any\nsuch breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, manipulated,\npublicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.\nAny such access, breach, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under domestic or foreign privacy, data\nprotection and data security laws such as HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (âHITECHâ), and\npenalties. Notice of certain security breaches must be made to affected individuals, the Secretary of HHS, and for extensive breaches, notice may need to\nbe made to the media or state attorneys general. Such notice could harm our reputation and our ability to compete. Although we have implemented\nsecurity measures, such data is currently accessible through multiple channels, and there is no guarantee we can protect our data from breach.\nUnauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also damage our reputation or disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses,\nconduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, and manage the administrative aspects of our\nbusiness.\nPenalties for violations of these laws vary. For instance, penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary\nsignificantly, and include significant civil monetary penalties and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation\nand/or imprisonment. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal\npenalty of up to $50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to\nsell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm.\nFurther, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations, such as the California\nConfidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other\npersonally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state afford greater protection to\nindividuals than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective, we have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties imposed\nupon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused.\nCaliforniaâs patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. Similarly, the CCPA\nallows consumers a private right of action when certain personal information is subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft or disclosure due to a\nbusinessâ failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying\ninterpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and data we receive, use and share, potentially exposing us\nto additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations\nconcerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws\nor regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, for the treatment of genetic data, along with increased customer\ndemands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products, decrease demand for our products, reduce our\nrevenues and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\n53\nTable of Contents\nWe may fail to comply with evolving privacy and data protection laws, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nNew privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the states in the U.S. and in the U.S. Congress, reflecting a trend\ntoward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which trend may accelerate with increasing concerns about individual privacy. The existence of\ncomprehensive privacy laws in different states in the U.S. may make our compliance obligations more complex and costly, may require us to modify our\ndata processing practices and policies, and may require us to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply.\nIn California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ), which became effective in 2020, broadly defines personal information, gives\nCalifornia residents expanded individual privacy rights and protections, provides for civil penalties for violations and gives California residents a private\nright of action for data breaches in certain cases. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (âCPRAâ), which became effective in 2023 and amends the\nCCPA, imposes additional obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit\nrequirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also created a new California Privacy Protection Agency authorized to\nissue substantive regulations and is expected to result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The CPRA also extends the provisions of\nboth the CCPA and the CPRA to the personal information of California-based employees. While there is an exception for certain health information,\nincluding protected health information that is subject to HIPAA, and clinical trial data, the CCPA may impact our business activities if we become a\nâBusinessâ regulated by the CCPA. Further, there continues to be some uncertainly about how certain provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and how\nsome areas of the law will be enforced. We will continue to monitor developments related to the CCPA and anticipate additional costs and expenses\nassociated with compliance.\nIn addition to the CCPA, broad consumer privacy laws recently went into effect in Virginia on January 1, 2023, in Colorado and Connecticut on\nJuly 1, 2023, and in Utah on December 31, 2023. New privacy laws will also become effective in Florida, Montana, Oregon and Texas in 2024, in\nDelaware, Iowa, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Tennessee in 2025, and in Indiana in 2026. In addition, numerous other states are considering new\ncomprehensive privacy laws.\nOther U.S. states, such as New York and Massachusetts have enacted stringent data security laws and numerous other states have proposed similar\nlaws. Additionally, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations, such as the California\nConfidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other\npersonally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state affords greater protection\nto individuals than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective, we have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties imposed\nupon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused.\nCaliforniaâs patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. Similarly, as\ndiscussed above, the CCPA allows consumers a private right of action when certain personal information is subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration,\ntheft or disclosure due to a businessâ failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures.\nFurthermore, over the past few years, the number of privacy-related enforcement actions in the U.S., and in many cases the fines, have steadily\nincreased. Failure to comply with these current and future laws, policies, industry standards, or legal obligations. or any data breach involving personal\ninformation, may result in government enforcement actions, litigation, fines, and penalties, private litigation, or adverse publicity, and could cause our\ncustomers, business partners, and investors to lose trust in us which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of our operations, and our\nfinancial condition. We continue to face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on our clinical trials and we may be\nunsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law.\nThe interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance\nissues for us and data we receive, use and share, potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus\non privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex,\nthese potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive\ndata, for the treatment of genetic data, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of\nproviding our products, decrease demand for our products, reduce our revenues and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\n54\nTable of Contents\nIn the European Union (âEUâ) and the United Kingdom (âUKâ), we may face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks in\nconnection with requirements of EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ), the GDPR as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain\nUK specific amendments incorporated into UK law on January 1, 2021 under the UK GDPR and other data protection requirements. The regulatory\nframework for collecting, using, safeguarding, sharing, transferring and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to\nremain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU and the subsequent separation of the data protection regimes of these\nterritories means we are required to comply with separate data protection laws in the EU and the UK, which may lead to additional compliance costs and\ncould increase our overall risk. Similar laws and regulations govern our processing of personal data, including the collection, access, use, analysis,\nmodification, storage, transfer, security breach notification, destruction and disposal of personal data. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer,\nor other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which took effect across all\nMember States of the European Economic Area (âEEAâ) on May 25, 2018, and as still in effect in the UK as the âUK GDPRâ. On June 28, 2021, the EU\nCommission adopted decisions on the UKâs adequacy under the EU GDPR, and the UK continues to operate under this adequacy decision. The GDPR\napplies to any company established in the EU as well as to those outside the EU that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or\nservices to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR imposes a broad range of data protection obligations on controllers and/or\nprocessors, as applicable, that must be complied with when processing personal data subject to the GDPR, including, for example, providing expanded\ndisclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have\nanother legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights\nfor individuals to be âforgottenâ and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g., access requests); the principal of accountability and\ndemonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; limitations on retention of information; mandatory data breach notification\nrequirements; safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data; restrictions on transfers of personal data outside of the EU to third\ncountries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections (such as the U.S.), and onerous new obligations and liabilities on services providers or data\nprocessors. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data are all classified as âspecial categoryâ data under the GDPR and afford\ngreater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Further, the UK and EU member states have a broad right to impose additional conditions\nâincluding restrictionsâon these data categories. This is because the GDPR allows EU member states to derogate from the requirements of the GDPR\nmainly in regard to specific processing situations (including special category data and processing for scientific or statistical purposes). Non-compliance\nwith the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to â¬20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater. Moreover, data subjects can\nclaim damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. The GDPR further grants non-profit organizations and consumer organizations the right to bring\nclaims on behalf of data subjects. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal\ndata, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from\noffering certain services in jurisdictions that we may operate in. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that\nwe process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the\nGDPR, including as implemented by individual EU Member States. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase\nour cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and\npenalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any activities in the EU.\nFurther, as referenced above, following the UKâs withdrawal from the EU (i.e., Brexit), and the expiry of the Brexit transition period, which ended\non December 31, 2020, the EU GDPR has been implemented in the UK (as the UK GDPR). The UK GDPR sits alongside the UK Data Protection Act\n2018 which implements certain derogations in the EU GDPR into UK law. Under the UK GDPR, companies not established in the UK but who process\npersonal data in relation to the offering of goods or services to individuals in the UK, or to monitor their behavior will be subject to the UK GDPR â the\nrequirements of which are (at this time) largely aligned with those under the EU GDPR and as such, may lead to similar compliance and operational costs.\nNon-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to Â£17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.\nIn addition, we may be unable to transfer personal data from the EU, UK, and other jurisdictions to U.S. or other countries due to limitations on\ncross-border data flows. In particular, the EEA and the UK have significantly regulated the transfer of personal data to the U.S. and other countries whose\nprivacy laws it believes are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of their data localization and cross-border data\ntransfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and the UK to the U.S. in\ncompliance with law, such as the EEA and UKâs standard contractual clauses and the newly-adopted Data Privacy Framework, these mechanisms are\nsubject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the U.S. If there is\nno lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK or other jurisdictions to the U.S., or if the requirements for a legally-compliant\ntransfer\n55\nTable of Contents\nare too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or\nall of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and\npenalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of\npersonal data necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and the UK to other jurisdictions,\nparticularly to the U.S., are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups.\nIf we are investigated by an EEA or UK data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties, which could have a negative effect on\nour existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or\nrefusal by EEA, UK, or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products due to the potential risk exposure because of the\ncurrent (and future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR\nand UK GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical partners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too\nlegally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business,\nprospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions outside of the EEA and the UK are also considering and/or enacting comprehensive data protection legislation.\nFor example, as of August 2020, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law imposes stringent requirements similar to GDPR with respect to personal\ninformation collected from individuals in Brazil.\nWe also continue to see jurisdictions imposing data localization laws. These regulations may interfere with our intended business activities,\ninhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many domestic and international privacy and data protection laws, commercial frameworks, and\nstandards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, frameworks, and standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our\nexisting data management practices and policies. It is also possible that by complying with one law, we may be violating another. In addition to the\npossibility of fines, lawsuits, breach of contract claims, and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business\nactivities and practices or modify our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Failure to comply with current and future privacy and\ndata protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (including the imposition of significant penalties), criminal and civil\nliability for us and our officers and directors, private litigation and/or adverse publicity that negatively affects our business. Any inability to adequately\nrespond to privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws, regulations, and policies,\ncould result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit our ability to conduct trials, and adversely affect our business.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with potential future financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or\notherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to\nemployees, directors and consultants under our stock incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our\nbusiness strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any\nsuch acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership\ninterests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-\ncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and collaborators. Misconduct by\nthese parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, to provide accurate information to the\nFDA and non-U.S. regulators, to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, to report financial information or\ndata accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject\nto extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThese laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer\nincentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained during clinical studies\nthat could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and\nthe precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us\nfrom governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are\ninstituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business,\nincluding the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nThere may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially\nharm us.\nProper systems of internal control over financial accounting and disclosure are critical to the operation of a public company. We may be unable to\neffectively establish such systems, especially in light of the fact that we expect to operate as a publicly reporting company. This would leave us without the\nability to reliably assimilate and compile financial information about us and significantly impair our ability to prevent error and detect fraud, all of which\nwould have a negative impact on us from many perspectives.\nMoreover, we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, even if established, will prevent all error and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systemâs\nobjectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be\nconsidered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact\nus.\nThe estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial statements could prove inaccurate.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. We cannot assure, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or\notherwise prove inaccurate. Any potential litigation related to the estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our\nfinancial statements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, harm our business, and cause our share price to decline.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from\nengaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some foreign companies, including\nsome that may compete with us, may not be subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may\noccur from time-to-time in countries in which we conduct our business. However, our employees or other agents may engage in conduct for which we\nmight be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other\nconsequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material to our\nfinancial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend such\nlitigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could\nnegatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result,\nlitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n57\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could\nharm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the\nhandling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use\nof hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract\nwith third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from\nthese materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any\nresulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties\nfor failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe maintain workersâ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from\nthe use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance\nfor environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or\nfuture environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts that could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other\nsanctions.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or they publish negative reports about our business, our share\nprice and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or\nour business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nshares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to\nregularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nDelaware law contains anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make the acquisition of our company and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more\ndifficult by prohibiting stockholders holding 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring us, without the consent of our board of directors,\nfor at least three years from the date they first hold 15% or more of the voting stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for\nsubstantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholdersâ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes\nwith us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any\nderivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising\npursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is\ngoverned by the internal affairs doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any\nliability or duty created by the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Unless we\nconsent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the U.S. of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by\napplicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The choice\nof forum provision may limit a stockholderâs ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers\nor other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find\nthe choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nadditional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operation.\n58\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2.

Business.\nOverview\nAcurx Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of small\nmolecule antibiotics for difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. Our approach is to develop antibiotic candidates with a\nGram-positive selective spectrum (âGPSSÂ®â) that block the active site of the Gram positive specific bacterial enzyme\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (âDNAâ) polymerase IIIC (\"pol IIICâ), inhibiting DNA replication and leading to Gram-positive\nbacterial cell death. Our research and development (âR&Dâ) pipeline includes antibiotic product candidates that target\nGram-positive bacteria, including Clostridioides difficile (âC. difficileâ), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n(âMRSAâ), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (âVREâ) and drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (âDRSPâ).\nThese bacterial targets are listed as priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (âWHOâ), the United\nStates (âU.S.â) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (âCDCâ) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(âFDAâ). Priority pathogens are those which require new antibiotics to address the worldwide crisis of antimicrobial\nresistance (âAMRâ) as identified by the WHO, CDC and FDA.\nThe CDC estimates that, in the U.S., antibiotic-resistant pathogens infect one individual every 11 seconds and result\nin one death every 15 minutes. The WHO recently stated that growing antimicrobial resistance is equally as dangerous as\nthe recent COVID-19 pandemic, threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and may leave us defenseless against\ninfections that today can be treated easily. According to the WHO, the current clinical development pipeline remains\ninsufficient to tackle the challenge of the increasing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.\nWe believe we are developing the first DNA pol IIIC inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical trials and have clinically\nvalidated the efficacy of our lead pol IIIC antibiotic candidate in a Phase 2 clinical trial.\nPol IIIC is the primary catalyst for DNA replication of several Gram-positive bacterial cells. Our research and\ndevelopment pipeline includes clinical stage and early-stage antibiotic candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria for\noral and/or parenteral treatment of infections caused by C. difficile, Enterococcus (including VRE), Staphylococcus\n(including MRSA), and Streptococcus (including antibiotic resistant strains).\nPol IIIC is required for the replication of DNA in certain Gram-positive bacterial species. By blocking this enzyme,\nour antibiotic candidates are believed to be bactericidal and inhibit proliferation of several common Gram-positive\nbacterial pathogens, including both sensitive and resistant C. difficile, MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus,\npenicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (âPRSPâ) and other resistant bacteria.\nWe have now âde-riskedâ this new class of antibiotics through our drug development activities as we advance to\nPhase 3 clinical trials by demonstrating proof of principal in Phase 2 human efficacy studies that demonstrate\ncomparable efficacy to the standard of care with no drug related side effects and a positive impact on the microbiome of\npatients with C. difficile infections. We expect to partner with a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company for late-stage\nclinical trials and commercialization or conduct Phase 3 clinical trials prior to such partnership and continue to review\npartnership opportunities on an ongoing basis up to FDA approval.\nOur lead antibiotic candidate, ibezapolstat (formerly named ACX-362E), has a novel mechanism of action that\ntargets the pol IIIC enzyme, a previously unexploited scientific target. Phase 2 clinical data validate the efficacy of our\nlead antibiotic candidate as well as pol IIIC as an appropriate bacterial target.\nCurrently available antibiotics used to treat C. difficile infection (âCDIâ) infections utilize other mechanisms of\naction. We believe ibezapolstat is the first antibiotic candidate to work by blocking the DNA pol IIIC enzyme in C.\ndifficile. This enzyme is necessary for replication of the DNA of certain Gram-positive bacteria, like C. difficile.\n3\nWe also have an early-stage pipeline of antibiotic product candidates with the same previously unexploited\nmechanism of action which has established proof of concept in animal studies. This pipeline includes ACX-375C, a\npotential oral and parenteral treatment targeting Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA, VRE and PRSP.\nWe continue to evaluate a strategic transaction for the Company, including a partner for the further development and\npotential commercialization of our lead antibiotic candidate, ibezapolstat, as well as a potential sale, merger, third-party\nlicensing arrangement or other strategic transaction. At this time we have no commitments from potential partners or\nothers to provide the company with capital.\nOur Technology\nThe results of our Phase 2 (2a and 2b) clinical trials also represent the first-ever clinical validation of DNA pol IIIC\nas a therapeutically relevant antibacterial target. Ibezapolstat was very well tolerated with no treatment-related SAEs\nnoted in the Phase 2 trials. Additionally, data obtained to date demonstrate that ibezapolstat enhances actinobacteria in\nthe microbiome and suppresses regrowth of proteobacteria; potentially lessening the likelihood of CDI recurrence or new\ninfection by Multi-Drug Resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the unexpected finding from further analysis of\nthe Phase 2 study is that the beneficial Firmicutes were shown to be preserved and/or regrow while patients were\nreceiving ibezapolstat therapy. Several follow-up experiments have demonstrated that many of these beneficial\nFirmicutes have heterogeneous susceptibility to ibezapolstat allowing them to continue to perform their beneficial\nbiologic functions even while a patient is receiving ibezapolstat for their CDI. (Garey, Oral Presentation, IDSA, IDWeek\n2022 Conference, Oct 19-23, 2022). These data were confirmed by the comparative microbiome data generated in the\nPhase 2b clinical trial and presented in a scientific poster on January 18, 2024 at the Gulf Coast Consortia Antimicrobial\nResistance (AMR) Conference in Houston, Texas by Kevin Garey, PharmD, MS, Professor and Chair, University of\nHouston College of Pharmacy, the Principal Investigator for microbiology and microbiome aspects of the ibezapolstat\nclinical trial program.\nPrior to conducting the Phase 2a clinical trial, we successfully completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of ibezapolstat for\nthe oral treatment of CDI (the âPhase 1 Trialâ). The Phase 1 Trial, conducted in the U.S., was a double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled study to determine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (âPKâ) and fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat in\n62 healthy volunteers. It was conducted in two parts; first, single ascending doses were administered to four cohorts of\neight subjects each, and second, multiple ascending doses were administered that simulate the anticipated clinical\ntreatment regimen. Safety information was analyzed through assessment of adverse events and other standard safety\nmeasures, while concentrations of ibezapolstat were determined in both blood and the feces, the latter being the critical\nsite of drug delivery for treating CDI. In addition, the laboratory of Dr. Kevin Garey at the University of Houston\nperformed state-of-the-art microbiomic testing of gastrointestinal flora in trial subjects as compared with vancomycin,\nthe standard of care for the treatment of patients with CDI, which testing was the first of its kind in Phase 1 clinical trials\nfor CDI.\nData from the case report forms completed by the principal investigators of the Phase I trial showed that single and\nmultiple ascending doses of ibezapolstat demonstrated a safety signal similar to placebo according to the principal\ninvestigators as evidenced by the case report forms. There were no safety signals reported on the case report forms\nrelated to physical examination or vital signs (blood pressure, pulse or oral temperature) in any part of the study. No\nsignificant abnormalities developed in the 12-lead electrocardiogram traces for any subject at any dose given according\nto the data reported by the principal investigators in the case report forms. No changes were observed in serum\nbiochemistry or hematological blood evaluations. No dose-dependent increase in adverse events, (each, an âAEâ) was\nreported, and no serious AEs were observed. The proportion of ibezapolstat-dosed subjects with an AE was similar to\nplacebo at each dosing level. All AEs were considered mild or moderate and none required a change in therapy or\nintervention.\nSystemic exposure following oral dosing was very low and no accumulation occurred after ten days of repeated\ndosing. In addition, oral dosing of ibezapolstat resulted in rapid and sustained fecal concentrations that are\napproximately 2,500 times the minimum inhibitory concentration of ibezapolstat required to kill the CDI bacteria in the\ncolon at the site of the infection. Comparative microbiome analysis versus vancomycin demonstrated a two to three log\nfavorable difference in the reduction of the predominantly healthy bacteria in the gut microbiome. Free concentrations of\nibezapolstat were found to be high enough to kill C. difficile but too low to kill healthy bacteria like Bacteroides &\n4\nFirmicutes which constitute approximately 90% of healthy microbiome in the judgment of our scientific advisors. Upon\nreview of the final Phase 1 Trial data, our medical and scientific advisors suggested these data supported advancing\nibezapolstat into a Phase 2 clinical trial at doses up to 450 mg, twice daily, for 10 days of treatment, as described above.\nWe believe that ibezapolstat is the only clinical-stage compound currently known to target C. difficile by acting\nspecifically on pol IIIC. This first clinical trial was a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and\nmultiple ascending dose study of safety, pharmacokinetics, food, and fecal microbiome effects in healthy adults\n(ACX 362E 101). This was a first-in-human trial that was a 3-part, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The parts\nconsisted of a single ascending dose (âSADâ) part (Part 1), food effect crossover part (Part 2), and multiple ascending\ndose (âMADâ) part (Part 3). Vancomycin was administered in open-label fashion in Part 3 of the study. The primary\nobjective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of ibezapolstat in both SAD and MAD administration to\nhealthy subjects. Secondary objectives were to assess pharmacokinetic changes associated with food, determine systemic\nand fecal pharmacokinetics of ibezapolstat during both SAD and MAD administration, and to determine the fecal\nmicrobiome effects of ibezapolstat compared with oral vancomycin.\nA total of 62 subjects were randomized to ibezapolstat or placebo. Ibezapolstat was administered at a dose of 150,\n300, 600, 900 mg or placebo for 1 dose in the SAD part (6 active:2 placebo/ group), 300 mg for 1 dose in the food effect\npart (n=8), and 300 or 450 mg or placebo every 12 hours (6 active:2 placebo) or vancomycin 125 mg every 6 hours\n(n=6) for 10 days in the MAD part.\nOverall, ibezapolstat was administered to 44 subjects in Phase 1 and was well tolerated with a safety signal similar\nto placebo. No dose-dependent increase in AEs was observed. The proportion of subjects with an AE was similar to\nplacebo at each ibezapolstat dose level. Administration of study drug in the fasting or fed state had a similar proportion\nof AEs. All AEs were considered mild or moderate in severity and none required a change in therapy or intervention. No\ndiarrhea was reported, and all stool samples were categorized as 4 or below on the Bristol Stool Chart (formed or semi\nformed). No changes were observed in physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), or clinical\nlaboratory results. The majority of ibezapolstat Cmax values at doses of 450 mg or below were <1 Âµg/mL.\nIn the Phase 2b trial segment, 32 patients with CDI were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either\nibezapolstat 450 mg every 12 hours or vancomycin 125 mg orally every 6 hours, in each case, for 10 days and followed\nfor 28 Â± 2 days following the end of treatment for recurrence of CDI. The two treatments were identical in appearance,\ndosing times, and number of capsules administered to maintain the blind. The overall observed Clinical Cure rate in the\ncombined Phase 2 trials in patients with CDI was 96% (25 out of 26 patients), based on 10 out of 10 patients (100%) in\nPhase 2a in the Modified Intent to Treat Population, plus 15 out of 16 (94%) patients in Phase 2b in the Per Protocol\nPopulation, who experienced Clinical Cure during treatment with ibezapolstat. Ibezapolstat was well-tolerated, with\nthree patients each experiencing one mild adverse event assessed by the blinded investigator to be drug-related. All three\nevents were gastrointestinal in nature and resolved without treatment. There were no drug-related treatment withdrawals\nand no drug-related serious adverse events, or other safety findings of concern. In the Phase 2b vancomycin control arm,\n14 out of 14 patients experienced Clinical Cure. We believe that based on the pooled Phase 2 ibezapolstat Clinical Cure\nrate of 96% and the historical vancomycin cure rate of approximately 81% (VancocinÂ® Prescribing Information,\nJanuary 2021), we will demonstrate non-inferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin in Phase 3 trials in accordance with\nthe applicable FDA Guidance for Industry (October, 2022).\nThe Phase 2b clinical trial segment was discontinued due to success. We made this decision in consultation with our\nmedical and scientific advisors and statisticians based on observed aggregate blinded data and other factors, including\nthe cost to maintain clinical trial sites and slow enrollment due to COVID-19 and its aftermath. We determined that the\ntrial performed as anticipated for both treatments, ibezapolstat and the control antibiotic vancomycin (a standard of care\nto treat patients with CDI), with high rates of clinical cure observed across the trial without any emerging safety\nconcerns. Accordingly, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee was not required to perform an interim analysis of\nthis Phase 2b trial data as originally planned. We anticipated that this decision would allow us to advance this first-in-\nclass, FDA QIDP/Fast Track-designated antibiotic product candidate to Phase 3 clinical trials more expeditiously.\nThe Phase 2b trial was originally designed to be a non-inferiority (âNIâ) trial and later amended to include an\ninterim efficacy analysis with review by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (âIDMCâ). The decision to end the\ntrial early based on blinded clinical observations obviated the need for an interim analysis, IDMC review, and NI\n5\nassessment. We determined, in consultation with our clinical and statistical experts, that presenting clinical cure rates for\nthe primary efficacy endpoint is the most appropriate representation for the clinical activity of ibezapolstat in treating\nCDI.\nIn the Phase 2 clinical trial, we also evaluated PK and microbiome changes and tested for anti-recurrence\nmicrobiome properties, including the change from baseline in alpha diversity and bacterial abundance, especially\novergrowth of healthy gut microbiota Actinobacteria and Firmicute phylum species during and after therapy. Phase 2a\ndata demonstrated complete eradication of colonic C. difficile by day three of treatment with ibezapolstat as well as the\nobserved overgrowth of healthy gut microbiota, Actinobacteria and Firmicute phyla species, during and after therapy.\nAlso, in Segment 2B of the study, ibezapolstat showed eradication of fecal C. difficile at day three of treatment in 15 of\n16 treated patients (94%), versus vancomycin, which had eradication of C. difficile in 10 of 14 treated patients (71%) in\nthe Per Protocol Population. Ibezapolstat, but not vancomycin, consistently preserved and allowed regrowth of key gut\nbacterial species such as Firmicutes, which are believed to help prevent CDI recurrence. Emerging data show an\nincreased concentration of secondary bile acids during and following ibezapolstat therapy which is known to correlate\nwith colonization resistance against C. difficile. A decrease in primary bile acids and the favorable increase in the ratio of\nsecondary-to-primary bile acids suggest that ibezapolstat may reduce the likelihood of CDI recurrence when compared\nto vancomycin.\nWe worked closely with the FDA to obtain authorization to proceed with clinical trials under our investigational\nnew drug application (âINDâ), and to obtain FDA fast track designation as well as designation of ibezapolstat as a\nqualified infectious disease product (âQIDPâ), which provides incentives through the Generating Antibiotic Incentives\nNow Act (the âGAIN Actâ) including FDA priority review for the first application submitted for the QIDP, fast track\ndesignation eligibility and extension of statutory exclusivity periods in the U.S. for an additional 5 years upon FDA\nmarketing approval of the product to treat patients with CDI.\nIbezapolstat originally was sponsored by GLSynthesis Inc., which completed several pre-clinical studies, developed\nthe current manufacturing process and filed for several of the patents that have been granted to date. We acquired\nworldwide rights to manufacture, develop and commercialize ibezapolstat from GLSynthesis Inc. on February 5, 2018,\npursuant to an asset purchase agreement executed by the parties on that date. At closing, we paid GLSynthesis\n$110,174 in cash and 100,000 Class B Membership Interests. We are also required to pay up to $700,000 in success-\nbased clinical milestone payments to GLSynthesis, including a payment of $500,000 upon the successful completion of\ntwo phase 3 clinical trials and a royalty of 4% on net sales of ibezapolstat throughout the duration of the patent period,\nwhich currently extends to September 2030.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, of the $700,000 of potential milestone payments, we have paid to GLSynthesis a\ntotal of $50,000, including $25,000 paid upon receipt of a âsafe to proceedâ notification from FDA relating to the\ncommencement of clinical trials (December 2018) and $25,000 paid upon the successful completion of clinical trial drug\nsupply suitable to support our Phase 1 clinical trial (December 2018). The patent jurisdictions of the acquired patents\ninclude the U.S., European Union (âEUâ), Japan and Canada.\nAbout QIDP and Fast Track Designations\nThe GAIN Act, which was enacted as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act\n(âFDASIAâ) in 2012, created incentives for the development of novel antibiotic and antifungal products intended to treat\nserious and life-threatening infections. The GAIN Act amended the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to add a\ndesignation for QIDPs. A QIDP is defined as âan antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious\nor life-threatening infections, including those caused by (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including\nnovel or emerging infectious pathogens, or (2) qualifying pathogens listed underâ 21 C.F.R. Â§ 317.2. The primary\nincentive for developing a QIDP is a five-year exclusivity extension for the relevant antibiotic or antifungal indications\nof the QIDP, but the designation also offers FDA priority review for the first application submitted for the QIDP and\neligibility for fast track designation.\nFDAâs fast track designation is a program designed to facilitate the development and expedite the regulatory\npathway of new drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that fill a high unmet medical need. To be\n6\neligible for a Fast Track Designation, the FDA must determine, based on preclinical study data submitted by the sponsor,\nthat a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to\naddress an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to\nexisting therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent\ninteractions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review\nsections of the new drug application (âNDAâ) for a fast track designated product on a rolling basis before the complete\napplication is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections\nand the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. In addition, fast track\ndesignation does not change the standards for product approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or\napproval process and the designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if it is no longer\nsupported by data emerging from the clinical trial process.\nA product designated as a QIDP also receives priority review for the first application for marketing authorization\nsubmitted to FDA for the product. The priority review program is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the\nevaluation of designated applications and to shorten the FDAâs goal for taking action on a marketing application from\nten months to six months for an original NDA for a new molecular entity from the date of filing.\nBased upon advice from our scientific advisors, we believe ACX-375C, our second antibiotic candidate currently in\npre-clinical development, will also be eligible for FDAâs QIDP and fast track designations. This advice is supported by\nthe âqualifyingâ criteria for a QIDP listed in GAIN Act legislation of 2012 enacted as part of the FDASIA. Specifically,\nthe qualifying pathogens listed under 21 C.F.R. Â§ 317.2 include bacterial pathogens against which ACX-375C has\ndemonstrated microbiological activity, namely, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant\nenterococcus. These bacteria are generally causative of serious or life-threatening infections, including, but not limited\nto, acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, community acquired pneumonia, blood stream infections, hospital\nacquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator acquired bacterial pneumonia, which are planned to be studied in future\nclinical trials at the appropriate time in product development.\nMechanism of Action\nDNA pol IIIC has proved essential for replicative DNA synthesis in aerobic, low G-C Gram-positive bacteria, i.e.\nthose with a low guanine-cytosine (âG-Câ) ratio relative to their adenine-thymine (âA-Tâ) ratio. Pol IIIC-specific genes\nof several such Gram-positive bacteria have been cloned and expressed, and the DNA pol IIIC enzymes appear to share\na unique capacity to be inhibited by 6-anilinouracils (âAUâ), 2-phenylguanines (âPGâ) and related compounds which are\nanalogs of 2 â-deoxyguanosine 5â -triphosphate (âdGTPâ).\nThe hypothesis supporting further development of ibezapolstat is that dGTP analog compounds bind to pol IIIC via\na âbase-pairing domainâ and an enzyme-specific âaryl domainâ (Figure 1). Through its base-pairing domain, which\nmimics that of guanine, the dGTP analog base pairs with an un-apposed template cytosine just distal to the DNA primer\nterminus. Simultaneously, the aryl domain binds an aryl-specific âreceptorâ near the pol IIIC enzymeâs dNTP binding\nsite, causing the formation of an inactive ternary complex of inhibitor (dGTP analog), DNA and pol IIIC (Figure 2).\n7\nFollowing the ternary binding hypothesis described above, Torti et al. (2011) reported that ibezapolstat (362E)\ninhibited purified pol IIIC derived from C. difficile (Ki 0.325 ÂµM) and from Bacillus subtilis (Ki 0.34 ÂµM) in in vitro\nresting. C. difficile has a single circular chromosome and one origin of replication (oriC) from which DNA replication\nbegins in a bi-directional fashion (Figure 3A). Using marker frequency analysis, the abundance of the oriC proximal\ngenes relative to the terminus (terC) proximal genes can be determined. C. difficile treated with 4 Âµg/mL of ibezapolstat\n(362E) demonstrated an 8-16-fold increased oriC:terC ratio, which would be expected for inhibition of DNA replication\n(Figure 3B).\nFigure 3. (A) Bi-directional replication of prokaryotes. (B) Marker Frequency Analysis of subinhibitory effects of\nPolC inhibitor ibezapolstat (362E) compared to the antibiotic Chloramphenicol (Cm).\nLeiden University Medical Center/Health Holland Research Project\nIn August 2021, Health Holland awarded a grant of approximately $500,000 USD to Leiden University Medical\nCenter (âLUMCâ) to further study the mechanism of action of pol IIIC inhibitors in a consortium partnership with our\n8\nCompany (the âHealth Holland Research Projectâ). This innovative research project entitled âBad bugs, new drugs:\nElucidation of the Structure of DNA Polymerase C (polC) of Multidrug Resistant Bacteria in Complex with Novel\nClasses of Antimicrobials (POLSTOP2)â will study 3-dimensional structures of DNA polymerases and their binding\ninteractions with our inhibitors. The antibacterial molecular target of our pipeline of novel DNA pol IIIC inhibitors has\nbeen clinically validated by ibezapolstatâs recent completion of a Phase 2 trial in patients with CDI. The Health Holland\nResearch Project is intended to accelerate lead product candidate selection for our ACX-375 program for systemic\ntreatment against multidrug resistant bacteria such as MRSA, VRE and DRSP and for other WHO, CDC and FDA high-\npriority, drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens where new classes of antibiotics are needed. This project was initiated\nby LUMC in September 2021 and emerging data are expected to contribute to the ACX-375C program development.\nRecently, we screened the activity of a library of 50 compounds for activity against pol IIIC of VRE and PRSP in a\nmedium throughput assay (Panel A below), leading to a IC50-ranked list of compounds with best in vitro activity.\nAdditionally, mutants conferring reduced susceptibility to ACX compounds in VRE and MRSA were mapped onto\nmodelled structures of pol IIIC in the presence of a DNA template (panel B below). Importantly, the first cryogenic\nelectron microscopy structures have been obtained using full length VRE pol IIIC, which resolved domains that are\nabsent in previous X-ray crystallographic data (panel C below). Ongoing efforts are aimed at refining the structure\n(currently at 3.0Ã resolution) in the presence of both DNA and representative ACX inhibitors, as well as extending the\nstructural work to MRSA pol IIIC.\nPre-Clinical Studies\nAll IND-enabling preclinical studies for ibezapolstat have been completed, including FDA-required toxicology,\npharmacokinetics and in vitro microbiology studies and in vivo animal models. Highlights from these studies are\nincluded below:\nToxicology\nGenetic Toxicology Studies:\nâ¢ Ames test: Negative\nâ¢ Mouse Lymphoma Assay: Negative\nâ¢ Micronucleus assay: Negative\nCardiovascular Safety:\nâ¢ hERG Assay: The IC50 observed represents an adequate safety margin\n9\nâ¢ Cardiovascular safety studies in telemetered dogs showed no significant CV risk\n14-day Toxicology Studies:\nâ¢ Rat: No effect on clinical observations, body weight, ophthalmology, hematology, clinical chemistry,\nurinalysis, micronucleus, gross necropsy, and microscopic endpoints; the no observed adverse effect level\n(âNOAELâ), is considered to be approximately 1000 mg/kg via oral administration\nâ¢ Dog: Emesis and diarrhea were observed in the high dose groups, which are considered test article-related; No\ndrug-related effects were observed for body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical pathology,\norgan weight, gross necropsy and microscopic evaluations; the NOAEL is approximately 200 mg/kg/day\nfollowing 14 days oral administration\nPharmacokinetics\nAdministration in male rats of a 5 mg/kg IV bolus dose of a salt form of GLS362E showed rapid systemic clearance\nand a short terminal half-life (0.34 hours). Plasma concentrations were BQL (<0.5ng/mL) at three to four hours post-\ndose. All oral dosing of GLS362E, now known as ibezapolstat, did not use the salt form, only the parent molecule since\nthe salt form is not necessary for oral dosing. Administration in male rats of a single 50mg/kg oral dose of ibezapolstat in\na suspension formulation, Cmax was 119ng/mL and was observed at 15 minutes post-dose. Plasma levels declined with\nan apparent terminal half â life of 3.82 hours and were still quantifiable at 24 hours post-dose. Oral bioavailability in\nmale rats was 8.6%. Ibezapolstat excretion in feces was much greater than urinary excretion, consistent with incomplete\noral bioavailability. After administration in male rats of a single 50 mg/kg oral dose of ibezapolstat in a suspension\nformulation, concentrations in the GI mucosa of all regions of the gastrointestinal tract were >10Âµg/mL at four hours\npost-dose, and >10 Âµg/mL at ten hours post-dose for ileum, cecum, colon and rectum. Fecal concentrations after oral\ndosing were approximately 100 to 200 mcg/mL.\nIn vitro Microbiology\nSeveral in vitro susceptibility tests have been completed. Below is a summary data table showing MIC values for\n22 C. difficile strains, conducted in triplicate, with the testing conducted by the R.M. Alden Laboratory in California and\nthe isolates obtained from the same. The table below shows that the activity of GLS362E was similar to that of\nvancomycin and metronidazole.\n22 C. difficile isolate MIC testing (Âµ g/mL), Median values Testing Conducted at R.M. Alden Labs in\nCalifornia\nDrug MIC range MIC50 MIC90\nIbezapolstat 1 â 4 2 4\nVancomycin 1 â 8 1 4\nMetronidazole 0.25 â 4 1 4\nData in the table below show that ibezapolstat was not active against two Bifidobacterium species or Eubacterium\nlentum at 32 Âµg/mL, the highest concentration tested. Activity was observed for lactobacilli and Clostridium perfringens.\nMost importantly, ibezapolstat was active against ten clinical isolates of C. difficile with an MIC range of 0.5 â 4 Âµg/mL,\nMIC50 of 2 Âµg/mL, and an MIC90 of 4 Âµg/mL. Since the pol IIIC target enzyme is present in only a narrow spectrum of\nGram-positive organisms, minimal disruption of gut flora is anticipated. This is supported by the data in the table below,\nwhich shows that representative specimens of other gut bacteria â lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and eubacterium â\nare not susceptible to ibezapolstat.\n10\nStudy Report GLS001: Agar Dilution MIC (Âµ g/mL) Testing Conducted at Micromyx, 2010.\nOrganism Micromyx Number 362E Metronidazole\n3967 (ATCC(1)\nBifidobacterium brevi 15698) >32 2\n3968 (ATCC\nBifidobacterium longum 15707) >32 4\nLactobacillus casei 1722 (ATCC 393) 16 >32\nLactobacillus acidophilus 0681 4 >32\n1274 (ATCC\nEubacterium lentum 43055) >32 0.25\nClostridium perfringens 3414 16 1\nClostridium difficile 3579 4 0.25\n3580 2 0.25\n3581 2 0.5\n3582 4 0.5\n3584 1 0.25\n3585 2 0.25\n3587 2 0.5\nStudy Report GLS001: Agar Dilution MIC (Âµ g/mL) Testing Conducted at Micromyx, 2010.\nOrganism Micromyx Number 362E Metronidazole\n3588 0.5 0.25\n3589 2 1\nQuality Control Strains\n4381 (ATCC 0.25 (0.12 â\nClostridium difficile 700057) 1 0.5)(2)\n0123 (ATCC 0.25 (0.25 â\nBacteroides fragilis 25285) >32 1)\n(1) American Type Culture Collection\n(2) Quality control range\nAdditional testing has shown that ibezapolstat is highly potent against 98 strains of recent clinical isolates of C.\ndifficile in the U.S., with an MIC50 of 2 Âµg/mL and an MIC90 of 4 Âµg/mL, as shown in the table below. Similar recent\ntesting of 364 European isolates showed identical MIC values.\n362E MTZ VAN FDX\nMIC range: 0.5 â 8 0.25 â >32 0.5 â 16 0.03 â > 8\nMIC50: 2 0.5 1 0.5\nMIC90: 4 4 4 2\nAbbreviations: MTZ=metronidazole; VAN=vancomyein; FDX=fidaxomicin.\nThe in vitro activity of ibezapolstat was tested in June 2019 by conducting minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\ntesting against 104 C. difficile clinical isolates, including those with important ribotypes. Fidaxomicin, vancomycin, and\nmetronidazole were used as comparators. When ibezapolstat achieved the â¥99.9% bacterial kill (i.e., 3-log reduction in\nbacterial numbers), it met the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (âCLSIâ) criteria for bactericidal activity which is\naccepted by FDA. This represents a laboratory measure of antibacterial potency but does not translate directly into\nhuman efficacy which can only be established in clinical trials.\n11\nResults indicated that the activity of ibezapolstat was similar to that of the comparators evaluated, with a narrow\nMIC range against 104 C. difficile clinical isolates, of which ~30% were of different ribotypes and another 30% were\ntoxigenic. In addition, 4 isolates of the epidemic strain ribotypes 027 and 078 demonstrated ACX-362E sensitivities\nsimilar to those of other ribotypes.\nIn Vitro Activity (in Âµg/mL) of ACX-362E (ibezapolstat) and Comparators against 104 C. difficile Clinical Isolates\nACX-362E\n(ibezapolstat) MTZ VAN FDX\nMIC range: 1 â 8 0.25 â 16 0.5 â 4 0.015 â 1\nMIC50: 4 0.5 1 0.12\nMIC90: 4 1 2 0.25\nAbbreviations: FDX=fidaxomicin; MIC=minimum inhibitory concentration; MTZ=metronidazole;\nVAN=vancomycin.\nOverall, the results of this study indicated that the activity of ibezapolstat was similar to that of the comparators\nevaluated in this study. With a narrow MIC range against 104 C. difficile clinical isolates, approximately 30% were of\ndifferent ribotypes and another 30% were toxigenic.\nIn July 2019 the bactericidal activity of ibezapolstat was evaluated by first determining the MIC and then the\nminimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against 3 C. difficile isolates; vancomycin and metronidazole were used as\ncomparators in these assays. In a second measure of bactericidal activity, the time-kill kinetics of ibezapolstat was\nassessed in comparison to vancomycin and metronidazole against the same 3 C. difficile isolates.\nAgainst two of the three isolates, ibezapolstat had MBC:MIC ratios of 1 to 4 across replicates indicating bactericidal\nactivity. For the remaining isolate, MBC:MIC ratios of 2 to >8 were observed although in instances where the ratio was\n>8, counts indicated >2-log10 killing at or near the MIC. When the time-kill kinetics (or the result of a microbiological\nlaboratory study of antimicrobial activity of a compound over time) of ibezapolstat were evaluated against C. difficile\nMMX 5680 and BAA-1382, bactericidal activity was observed at the two later time points and at all three evaluated\ndoses (MMX 5680) or the two highest doses (BAA-1382). Against C. difficile isolate BAA-1875, ibezapolstat did not\ndemonstrate the â¥3 log10 CFU/mL killing required for bactericidal activity, but bacterial levels were reduced by >2\nlog10 CFU at the 24- and 48-hour time points at 16X and 32X the MIC. In the case of metronidazole and vancomycin,\nthe highest MIC value recorded from the triplicate testing was used to calculate 8X, 16X, and 32X the MIC for the time\nkill study.\nActivity of ibezapolstat and Comparators against C. difficile Isolates\nACX -36 2E\n(ibezapolstat) Metronidazole Vancomycin\nOrganism Isolate No. Type Replicate MIC MBC MIC MBC MIC MBC\nC. difficile MMX 5680 Ribotype 027 A 1 1 2 2 0.5 0.5\nB 1 1 4 4 0.5 0.5\nC 1 2 2 2 0.25 0.25\nBAA- 1382 Ribotype 012 A 1 4 0.5 0.5 1 2\nB 1 2 0.5 1 1 1\nC 1 2 1 1 1 2\nBAA- 1875 Ribotype 078 A 1 >8* 0.5 1 0.25 0.5\nB 1 2 1 1 0.5 0.5\nC 1 >8* 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5\nAbbreviations: MIC=minimum inhibitory concentration; MBC=minimum bactericidal concentration.\n12\n* Counts only slightly exceeded the rejection values for 3-log killing (indicating that 3-log killing was nearly\nachieved).\nNonclinical data indicate that ibezapolstat demonstrates reproducible and consistent in vitro potency against C.\ndifficile and is comparable to vancomycin in the standard and predictive Syrian Golden Hamster model of CDI. The\nnonclinical data also indicate that ibezapolstat may be active against C. difficile in the human colon, and in fact,\nibezapolstat concentrations reached approximately 2,500-fold greater than the MIC needed to kill the C. difficile in this\nPhase 1 first-in-man clinical trial.\nIn vivo Efficacy Animal Models\nGLS-362E (and GLS-359E) were studied in vivo in the golden Syrian hamster model of C. difficile-induced colitis.\nBoth compounds had low GI absorption (<5% of an oral dose of 75 mg/kg was absorbed) and low toxicity (up to\n1,000 mg/kg in hamsters). In the in vivo model, hamsters are first treated subcutaneously with clindamycin, followed\n24 h later with ~107 CFU of C. difficile spores administered orally; therapy was initiated ~17 hours post-infection. Initial\nexperiments evaluated the efficacy of the two compounds in this model (Dvoskin, et al, 2012, AAC) with studies\ndesigned to optimize the dose and length of therapy. In experiment 1 (shown in Table 2, below), treatment was given\ntwice daily for three days with either vancomycin (50 mg/kg),\nGLS-359E or GLS-362E (GLS-359E and GLS-362E dosed at 50, 25, 12.5, or 6.25 mg/kg), with survivorship followed\nthrough 120 hours. 362E was found to be more efficacious at lower doses than GLS-359E: 6.25 mg/kg of 362E was\nsuperior to an equivalent dose of GLS-359E (P<0.001). For this reason, GLS-362E was profiled further.\nSubsequent experiments extended the length of therapy for GLS-362E to 7 or 14 days because in the experiment\nshown in Table 2 it was observed that survival was not maintained beyond five days after the end of treatment in any\ngroup; studies were then designed to evaluate recurrence rates. Table 2 displays (below, from Dvoskin, et. al, 2012,\nAAC) twice-daily treatment for three days with either GLS-362E (50 mg/kg) or vancomycin (50 mg/kg), 67% of treated\nanimals died. When treatment with GLS-362E is extended to 7 or 14 days, survival increased to 60% and 100%,\nrespectively. Upon necropsy, the intestinal contents of surviving hamsters were negative for toxin A and/or B whereas\nthose for animals that had died were positive. The results for the 3-day dosing shown in Table 2 above were from\nadditional studies. Other studies conducted by Dvoskin et al. evaluated GLS-362E efficacy/recurrence rates in the\nhamster model at lower doses: after 14 days of dosing (100% survival for all groups at 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/kg out to\n36 days; negative for A/B toxins): after 10 days of dosing at 10 mg/kg, GLS-362E treatment resulted in 86% survival on\nDay 36 post-infection, compared to vancomycin treatmentâs 43% survival at the same dose (see graph and table below)\nand animals that died with C. difficile disease symptoms tested positive for A/B toxin, whereas the surviving animals did\nnot.\n13\nHamster Efficacy vs C. difficile infection**\nSurvivors acute Survivors with no recurrent\nDrug infection/total animals infection /total animals\nGLS362 7/7 6/7\n(ibezapolstat)\nvancomycin 7/7 3/7\n** Animals were infected and treated orally with 2x10mg/kg/day of the indicated drug for 10 days; acute responses\nwere determined during the treatment and recurrent infections after 36 days.\nC. difficile Infection Overview\nClostridioides difficile infection (âCDIâ) is a bacterial infection of the colon that produces toxins causing\ninflammation of the colon and severe diarrhea. CDI can also result in more serious disease complications, including\npseudomembranous colitis, bowel perforation, toxic megacolon and sepsis. CDI represents a serious healthcare issue in\nhospitals, long-term care homes and, increasingly, in the wider community. We estimate that there are over one million\ncases of CDI each year in the U.S. and Europe, based on an epidemiology report on CDI that was published in 2015 by\nDecision Resources, a healthcare research and consulting company. In addition, CDI is responsible for approximately\n29,000 deaths per year in the U.S., according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. A\nseparate study published in 2018 in Clinical Microbiology and Infection, a peer reviewed journal published by the\nEuropean Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, indicated that CDI may be underdiagnosed in\napproximately 25% of cases. A study published in The Journal of Hospital Infection, a peer reviewed journal published\nby the Healthcare Infection Society, reported that CDI is two to four times more common than hospital associated\ninfections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium frequently associated with such infections.\nThe Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, a family of databases developed through a federal-state-industry partnership\nsponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nreported an approximate three and one-half-fold increase in hospital stays associated with CDI between 2000 and 2008.\nThe economic impact of CDI is significant. A study published in 2012 in Clinical Infectious Diseases estimated that\nacute care costs for CDI total $4.8 billion per year in the U.S. alone. According to the 2017 Update (published\nFebruary 2018) of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for C. difficile Infection by the Infectious Diseases Society of\nAmerica (IDSA) and Society or Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), CDI remains a significant medical\n14\nproblem in hospitals, in long-term care facilities and in the community. C. difficile is one of the most common causes of\nhealth care-associated infections in U.S. hospitals (Lessa, et al, 2015, New England Journal of Medicine). Recent\nestimates suggest C. difficile approaches 500,000 infections annually in the U.S. and is associated with approximately\n20,000 deaths annually. (Guh, 2020, New England Journal of Medicine). Based on internal estimates, the recurrence rate\nof two of the three antibiotics currently used to treat CDI is between 20% and 40% among approximately 150,000\npatients treated. We believe the annual incidence of CDI in the U.S. approaches 600,000 infections and a mortality rate\nof approximately 9.3%. There are an additional six million patients in the U.S. per year with other Gram+ infections,\nsuch as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus or Enterococcal, with approximately 300,000 patients treated for such infections.\nCDI originates from a bacterium known as Clostridium difficile, or Clostridioides difficile, or C. difficile.\nC. difficile can be a harmless resident of the gastrointestinal tract. The complex community of microorganisms that\nmake up the natural gut flora usually moderates levels and pathogenicity of C. difficile. The natural gut flora is an\nessential part of the normal function of the gastrointestinal tract and also has wide implications to human health, such as\nthe proper function of the immune system. CDI typically develops following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic agents\nthat can cause widespread damage to the natural gut flora and allow overgrowth of C. difficile. Hypervirulent C. difficile\nstrains have also emerged and are frequently associated with more severe disease. In the U.S., the hypervirulent strain,\nribotype 027, accounts for approximately one-third of all CDI cases.\nAn important clinical issue with CDI is disease recurrence. This is in contrast to other bacterial threats for which\ndrug resistance is the principal concern. According to an article published in 2012 in the peer reviewed journal Clinical\nMicrobiology and Infection, 20% to 40% of patients with CDI suffer a second episode of the infection. The risk of\nfurther recurrence rises to 65% after a patient suffers a third episode of CDI. In addition, each episode of recurrent\ndisease is associated with greater disease severity and higher mortality rates. Recurrent disease is associated with an\nincreased burden on the healthcare system.\nIn 2013, and again in a 2019 Update, the CDC highlighted C. difficile as one of five pathogens that pose an\nimmediate public health threat and require urgent and aggressive action. In 2012, the GAIN Act provisions became law\nalong with the rest of FDASIA. The goal of the GAIN Act is to encourage the development of new antibiotics that treat\nspecific pathogens, including C. difficile, which cause serious and life-threatening infections. Since the GAIN Act was\nadopted, there have been two antibiotic candidates developed for CDI that have been granted QIDP status under the\nGAIN Act, one of which was approved by the FDA in 2011. See âCurrent CDI Antibiotic Treatmentsâ below.\nCurrent CDI Antibiotic Treatments\nCurrent treatment options for CDI are limited. The current standard-of-care for CDI is treatment with vancomycin\nor, to a lesser extent, off label use of metronidazole, both of which are broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although these\nantibiotics reduce levels of C. difficile, both also cause significant collateral damage to the gut flora as a result of their\nbroad spectrum of activity. This collateral damage to the gut flora leaves patients vulnerable to recurrent CDI. A review\npublished in 2012 in the peer reviewed journal International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents reported recurrence rates\nof 24.0% for vancomycin and 27.1% for metronidazole. Metronidazole is frequently used in mild or moderate cases of\nCDI and has been associated with a number of side effects. The 2017 Update (published February 2018) of the Clinical\nPractice Guidelines for C. difficile Infection by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of\nHealthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) provides a recommendation for clinicians to prescribe either vancomycin\nor fidaxomicin over metronidazole for an initial episode of CDI and metronidazole is no longer recommended for\ntreatment of patients with CDI.\nFidaxomicin (DificidÂ®) is also a standard of care to treat patients with CDI. It is an antibiotic approved to treat\npatients with CDI in the U.S. and the EU, but it has not been shown to be superior to vancomycin in the treatment of\npatients with the hypervirulent strain ribotype 027. Fidaxomicin (DificidÂ®) was approved by FDA in 2011. In July 2013,\nOptimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the sponsor of the fidaxomicin program, was sold to Cubist Pharmaceuticals for\n$535 million plus up to $266 million in contingent value right (âCVRâ) payments post-closing. Fidaxomicin was the\nfirst antibacterial drug the FDA approved in more than 30 years to treat CDI. Cubist Pharmaceuticals was acquired by\n15\nMerck in 2015 for approximately $8.4 billion. Merck continues to market fidaxomicin (DificidÂ®) and is expected to\ncontinue through the patent life which is expected to expire in mid-2027.\nSummit Therapeutics had a clinical stage antibiotic, ridinilazole, and in January 2019 had opened enrollment of two\nPhase 3 clinical trials to treat patients with CDI. In December 2021, Summit Therapeutics announced that ridinilazole\nhad failed to achieve the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 clinical trials and has since announced a plan to partner\nridinilazole and has moved strategically into oncology drug development. The ridinilazole Phase 3 program included two\nrandomized trials testing efficacy in CDI versus oral vancomycin, the standard of care, as the positive control. The trials\nappeared to be identical in design and planned to enroll 680 patients each. Prior to failing to achieve the primary\nendpoint in its Phase 3 clinical trials, in the fourth quarter of 2021, Summit Therapeutics announced that the FDA had\nrejected Summitâs request to change the endpoint in the then ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. Ridinilazole is an orally\nadministered small molecule antibiotic designed to selectively target C. difficile bacteria without causing collateral\ndamage to the gut flora and thereby reduce CDI recurrence rates. Prior to failing in its Phase 3 clinical trial, ridinilazole\ncompleted two Phase 2 clinical trials successfully meeting or exceeding its primary efficacy endpoints.\nDespite the approval of fidaxomicin to treat CDI, the CDC continues to cite C. difficile bacteria as an urgent need\nfor new antibiotics to treat CDI.\nClinical Strategy\nBased on advice from our medical and scientific consultants and advisors, we believe we will need to conduct one\nPhase 2 clinical trial prior to conducting one or two large Phase 3 clinical trials in order to file a new drug application\nwith the FDA for the oral use of ibezapolstat to treat patients with CDI. The trial design and anticipated size of the\nrequired clinical trials is as follows:\nPhase 1 Clinical Trial: Data reported in August 2019.\nThe Phase 1 clinical trial design was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending\ndose trial to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and fecal microbiological effects of ibezapolstat administered orally\nto 62 healthy adults 18 years of age or older. For the single-dose ascending portion of the trial, the objectives were to\nevaluate the safety and determine the pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure of single doses as well as the effects of\nfood on PK. The multiple ascending dose portion of the trial evaluated the safety, PK and fecal concentrations of\nrepeated doses as well as evaluate the effects of ibezapolstat on characteristics of the gut microbiome in comparison to\n16\nthe current standard of care treatment antibiotic, oral vancomycin. We successfully completed the Phase 1 clinical trial in\nAugust 2019 and the data supported advancing to Phase 2 according to our medical and scientific advisors. Blood levels\nof ibezapolstat show low systemic exposure, as predicted by previously conducted animal studies and are desirable in\ntreating CDI, and fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude above the level required to kill\nCDI bacteria at the site of the infection.\nPhase 2 Clinical Trial.\nThe Phase 2 clinical trial design was structured as a randomized, controlled Phase 2 trial of the efficacy and safety\nof ibezapolstat compared to vancomycin in the treatment of CDI in a total of up to 84 evaluable patients (Phase 2a; up to\n20 patients; Phase 2b; 64 patients). Phase 2a was designed to enroll up to 20 patients with a data review planned by a\nTrial Oversight Committee after 10 patients completed the trial.\nBased upon the recommendation of our Scientific Advisory Board (the âSABâ), in August 2020, we terminated\nenrollment in Phase 2a early and advanced to Phase 2b in December 2021. The SAB unanimously supported the early\ntermination of the Phase 2a trial after 10 patients were enrolled in the trial instead of 20 patients as originally planned.\nThe early termination was further based on the evidence of meeting the treatment goals of eliminating the infection with\nan acceptable adverse event profile.\nThe SAB noted that 10 out of 10 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a trial reached the Clinical Cure endpoint, defined\nin the study protocol as the resolution of diarrhea in the 24-hour period immediately before the end-of-treatment that is\nmaintained for 48 hours after end of treatment. Such cure was sustained, meaning that the patients showed no sign of\ninfection recurrence, for 30 days thereafter. This constitutes a 100% response rate for the primary and secondary\nendpoints of the trial. All 10 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a trial met the studyâs primary and secondary efficacy\nendpoints, namely, Clinical Cure at end of treatment and Sustained Clinical Cure of no recurrence of CDI at the 28-day\nfollow-up visit. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported by the investigators who enrolled patients in\nthe trial. We believe these results represent the first-ever clinical data validating pol IIIC as a therapeutically-relevant\nantibacterial target. The Phase 2b portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial was designed as a 64-patient vancomycin-\ncontrolled, non-inferiority designed efficacy study.\nThe SAB is comprised of seven scientists and clinicians who have significant expertise in the scientific disciplines\nrequired for the research and development of antibiotics. The members of the SAB serve at the pleasure of management,\nare paid in cash on an hourly basis for their services and do not receive equity compensation. Generally, the SAB is\nconsulted by management during the process of designing our preclinical and clinical trials as well as in the process of\nanalyzing data generated from these trials, although the SABâs services are not limited to such activities.\nIn the Phase 2b trial segment, 32 patients with CDI were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either\nibezapolstat 450 mg every 12 hours or vancomycin 125 mg orally every 6 hours, in each case, for 10 days and followed\nfor 28 Â± 2 days following the end of treatment for recurrence of CDI. The two treatments were identical in appearance,\ndosing times, and number of capsules administered to maintain the blind. The overall observed Clinical Cure rate in the\ncombined Phase 2 trials in patients with CDI was 96% (25 out of 26 patients), based on 10 out of 10 patients (100%) in\nPhase 2a in the Modified Intent to Treat Population, plus 15 out of 16 (94%) patients in Phase 2b in the Per Protocol\nPopulation, who experienced Clinical Cure during treatment with ibezapolstat. Ibezapolstat was well-tolerated, with\nthree patients each experiencing one mild adverse event assessed by the blinded investigator to be drug-related. All three\nevents were gastrointestinal in nature and resolved without treatment. There were no drug-related treatment withdrawals\nor no drug-related serious adverse events, or other safety findings of concern. In the Phase 2b vancomycin control arm,\n14 out of 14 patients experienced Clinical Cure. We believe that based on the pooled Phase 2 ibezapolstat Clinical Cure\nrate of 96% and the historical vancomycin cure rate of approximately 81% (VancocinÂ® Prescribing Information,\nJanuary 2021), we will demonstrate non-inferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin in Phase 3 trials in accordance with\nthe applicable FDA Guidance for Industry (October, 2022).\nThe Phase 2b clinical trial segment was discontinued due to success. We made this decision in consultation with our\nmedical and scientific advisors and statisticians based on observed aggregate blinded data and other factors, including\nthe cost to maintain clinical trial sites and slow enrollment due to COVID-19 and its aftermath. We determined that the\n17\ntrial performed as anticipated for both treatments, ibezapolstat and the control antibiotic vancomycin (a standard of care\nto treat patients with CDI), with high rates of clinical cure observed across the trial without any emerging safety\nconcerns. Accordingly, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee was not required to perform an interim analysis of\nthis Phase 2b trial data as originally planned. We anticipated that this decision would allow us to advance this first-in-\nclass, FDA QIDP/Fast Track-designated antibiotic product candidate to Phase 3 clinical trials more expeditiously.\nThe Phase 2b trial was originally designed to be a non-inferiority (NI) trial and later amended to include an interim\nefficacy analysis with review by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The decision to end the trial early\nbased on blinded clinical observations obviated the need for an interim analysis, IDMC review, and NI assessment. We\ndetermined, in consultation with our clinical and statistical experts, that presenting clinical cure rates for the primary\nefficacy endpoint is the most appropriate representation for the clinical activity of ibezapolstat in treating CDI.\nIn the Phase 2 clinical trial, we also evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK) and microbiome changes and tested for anti-\nrecurrence microbiome properties, including the change from baseline in alpha diversity and bacterial abundance,\nespecially overgrowth of healthy gut microbiota Actinobacteria and Firmicute phylum species during and after therapy.\nPhase 2a data demonstrated complete eradication of colonic C. difficile by day three of treatment with ibezapolstat as\nwell as the observed overgrowth of healthy gut microbiota, Actinobacteria and Firmicute phyla species, during and after\ntherapy. Also, in Segment 2B of the study, ibezapolstat showed eradication of fecal C. difficile at Day 3 of treatment in\n15 of 16 treated patients (94%), versus vancomycin, which had eradication of C. difficile at in 10 of 14 treated patients\n(71%) in the Per Protocol Population. Ibezapolstat, but not vancomycin, consistently preserved and allowed regrowth of\nkey gut bacterial species such as Firmicutes, which are believed to help prevent CDI recurrence. Emerging data show an\nincreased concentration of secondary bile acids during and following ibezapolstat therapy which is known to correlate\nwith colonization resistance against C. difficile. A decrease in primary bile acids and the favorable increase in the ratio of\nsecondary-to-primary bile acids suggest that ibezapolstat may reduce the likelihood of CDI recurrence when compared\nto vancomycin.\nPhase 3 Clinical Trial(s).\nFollowing completion of our Phase 2b clinical trial, we intend to meet with the FDA to finalize the size and scope of\nthe Phase 3 clinical trial program. Regulatory precedent indicates that two Phase 3 trials would need to be conducted.\nWe plan to include international clinical trial sites for our Phase 3 clinical trial program to enhance overall enrollment\nand provide clinical data to support an approval pathway outside the U.S. in major pharmaceutical markets.\nRegulatory Status\nThe regulatory timeline for a newly proposed product can take eight to ten years from pre-clinical studies through\nmarketing approval. However, we inherited the manufacturing and pre-clinical data generated by the prior sponsor of our\nlead product candidate which we believe will reduce the timeline for regulatory approval by two to three years.\nWe have worked closely with the FDA to obtain authorization to proceed with clinical trials under our IND, and to\nobtain FDA fast track designation as well as designation of ibezapolstat as a QIDP, which provides incentives through\nthe GAIN Act including FDA priority review for the first application submitted for the QIDP, fast-track designation\neligibility and extension of statutory exclusivity periods in the U.S. for an additional five years upon FDA approval of\nthe product for the treatment of CDI.\nWe intend to launch regulatory activities in 2024 to design a regulatory approval pathway for ibezapolstat in the EU,\nthe United Kingdom (âUKâ), Canada and possibly Japan. We commenced this international regulatory pathway by\nobtaining micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (âSMEâ) designation from the European Medicines Agency in\nFebruary 2024. The SME designation provides much reduced fees associated with the drug development pathway and\nclose interaction with the regulatory authorities throughout the drug development process.\n18\nGovernment Regulation\nThe research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-\nkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated\nby governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S.\nand in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and\nother regulatory requirements, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.\nU.S. Government regulation of drug products\nIn the U.S., the FDA regulates human drugs under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply\nwith the applicable U.S. requirements may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA\nrefusal to approve pending NDAs, or the agencyâs issuance of warning letters, or the imposition of fines, civil penalties,\nproduct recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal\nprosecution brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice or other governmental entities.\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the\nfollowing:\nâ¢ completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory\nPractice (âGLPâ) regulations or other applicable regulations;\nâ¢ submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;\nâ¢ approval by an independent institutional review board (âIRBâ), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site\nbefore each clinical trial may be initiated;\nâ¢ performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND\nregulations, good clinical practice regulations and standards (âGCPâ), and other clinical-trial related regulations\nto evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;\nâ¢ submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval, including payment of application user fees;\nâ¢ satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is\nproduced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice regulations (âcGMPâ), to assure that\nthe facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the productâs identity, strength, quality and purity;\nâ¢ potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical\ndata submitted in support of the NDA; and\nâ¢ FDA review and approval of the NDA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee\nreview of the product candidate, where appropriate or if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale\nof the product in the United States.\nBefore testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical\ntesting. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation\nand stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor\nmust submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available\nclinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for\nauthorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human\nclinical trials may begin.\n19\nPreclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and\nanimal studies, to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use.\nThe conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for\nsafety and toxicology studies.\nAll clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with\nprotocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring the safety and effectiveness\ncriteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and each study subject must sign\nan informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after\nreceipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed\nclinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve\nany outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds may be imposed by the FDA at any time\nbefore or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.\nIn addition, an IRB representing each institution that is participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the\nplan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must thereafter conduct a continuing\nreview and reapprove the trial at least annually.\nHuman clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\nPhase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage\ntolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening\ndiseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy\nvolunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.\nPhase 2: This phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety\nrisks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage\ntolerance and optimal dosage.\nPhase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken with an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical\nefficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These\nstudies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an\nadequate basis for product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator\ntreatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.\nPost-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing\napproval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic\nindication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of\napproval of an NDA.\nProgress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more\nfrequently if serious adverse events (âSAEsâ) occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at\nany time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an\nunacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the\nclinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol, GCP, or other IRB requirements or if the\ndrug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.\nIn the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, Congress amended the FDCA to require sponsors of a Phase 3\nclinical trial, or other âpivotal studyâ of a new drug to support marketing authorization, to submit a diversity action plan\nfor such clinical trial. The action plan must include the sponsorâs diversity goals for enrollment, as well as a rationale for\nthe goals and a description of how the sponsor will meet them. A sponsor must submit a diversity action plan to FDA by\nthe time the sponsor submits the trial protocol to the agency for review. The FDA may grant a waiver for some or all of\nthe requirements for a diversity action plan. If FDA objects to a sponsorâs diversity action plan and requires the sponsor\nto amend the plan or take other actions, it may delay trial initiation.\n20\nAssuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials, along with information relating to the productâs chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and proposed labeling, are\nsubmitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under\nfederal law, the fee for the submission of an NDA for which clinical data is substantial (for example, for fiscal year 2024\nthis application fee exceeds $4 million), and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee,\ncurrently more than $415,000 per program. These fees are typically adjusted annually, but exemptions and waivers may\nbe available under certain circumstances.\nUnder the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (âPDUFAâ), for\noriginal NDAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date (i.e., the date on which the FDA accepts a submitted NDA\nfor filing) in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months\nfrom the filing date for an application with priority review. For an all new molecular entity (âNMEâ), NDAs, the ten and\nsix-month time periods run from the filing date; for all other original applications, the ten and six-month time periods\nrun from the submission date. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an NDA to extend\nbeyond the goal date.\nBefore approving an NDA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities\nfor the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP. The FDA will\nnot approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with\ncGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA\nalso may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the\nintegrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.\nThe FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended\nuse and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the productâs identity, strength, quality and\npurity. On the basis of the FDAâs evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the\ninspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter\n(âCRLâ). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for\nspecific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be\napproved in its present form and outlines the deficiencies in the submission that must be addressed for the FDA to\nreconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAâs satisfaction in a\nresubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.\nFollowing approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and\ncontinuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of\nadverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and\nadvertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e.,\nâoff-label useâ) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Once a drug is granted\napproval, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not\nmaintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems\nwith a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or\nfailure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new\nsafety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or\nother restrictions. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\nâ¢ restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the\nmarket or product recalls;\nâ¢ fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;\nâ¢ refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation\nof product approvals;\nâ¢ product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n21\nâ¢ injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\nâ¢ consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or\nmandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act and Marketing Exclusivity\nIn 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve\ngeneric drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute and\nalso enacted Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an\nabbreviated new drug application (âANDAâ) to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may\nrely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as\nthe reference listed drug (âRLDâ). Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the\ngeneric version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage\nform, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is\nâbioequivalentâ to the innovator drug.\nIn contrast, Section 505(b)(2) enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDAâs prior findings of safety and\nefficacy data for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may\nprovide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved\nproducts; for example, an applicant may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications\nor for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. Section\n505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies\nnot conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A Section\n505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain nonclinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that\nreliance on studies conducted for a previously approved product is scientifically appropriate. Unlike the ANDA pathway\nused by developers of bioequivalent versions of innovator drugs, which does not allow applicants to submit new clinical\ndata other than bioavailability or bioequivalence data, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility\nthat a follow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies; for example, they may\nbe seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would\nrequire new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or\nsome of the label indications for which the RLD has been approved, or for any new indication sought by the Section\n505(b)(2) applicant, as applicable.\nUpon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (âNCEâ), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been\napproved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity. During the exclusivity\nperiod, the FDA cannot accept for review any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another\nversion of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for\napproval. However, a follow-on product application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a\nParagraph IV certification, which states that the listed patent for the RLD is invalid or will not be infringed by the\nfollow-on product, is filed on an NCE patent and any time after approval if the application is filed based on a new\nindication or a new formulation.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to\nan existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by\nthe applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications,\ndosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the\nnew clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving follow-on applications for drugs containing\nthe original active agent. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification,\nand, thus, no ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Five-year and three-\nyear exclusivity also will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the\nFDCA. However, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to either conduct or obtain a right of\nreference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety\nand effectiveness.\n22\nPatent Term Restoration\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some\nof our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman\nAct permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for any patent term lost during product\ndevelopment and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining\nterm of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the productâs approval date. The patent term restoration period is\ngenerally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time\nbetween the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved\ndrug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to the expiration of the patent. The\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (âUSPTOâ), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the\napplication for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term\nfor some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on\nthe expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.\nManufacturing\nOverall, management believes the manufacturing process established by the prior sponsor of our ibezapolstat\ndevelopment program is efficient with cost of goods sold expected to be less than 5% of a preliminary range of proposed\nsales price estimates.\nThus far, ibezapolstat drug substance (âDSâ) has been manufactured successfully in both 1 kg and 9 kg batches,\nwith 9 kg batches considered to be at commercial scale. We anticipate that the commercial batch size upon completion\nof the clinical development program and submission of a New Drug Application (âNDAâ) will be 10 kg to 15 kg which\nin our estimation will further reduce our cost of goods. The 9kg batch was sufficient to support the Phase 1 and Phase 2\nclinical trial needs. No material issues were noted in the manufacture of either the 1 kg or 9 kg batches of ibezapolstat to\ndate with 36-month stability very good and well within acceptable FDA standards. Additionally, we can extrapolate to\n48-months stability per FDA Manufacturing Guidance in advance of a 48-month pull point to occur in the first half of\n2024.\nIbezapolstat drug product (âDPâ), 150mg capsules, has been manufactured and used in the Phase 1 and Phase 2\nclinical trials. Thirty-six months stability data on capsules show no significant changes in the key quality attributes and\nno discernable data trends at any of the storage conditions. A minimum of 24-months shelf-life is anticipated. Through\nour outside manufacturing vendors, we will continue to monitor the stability of DS and DP on an ongoing basis as we\ncontinue to advance the clinical development program.\nMarket Opportunity\nAccording to the 2017 Update (published February 2018) of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Clostridium\ndifficile Infection in Adults and Children by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare\nEpidemiology of America (SHEA), CDI remains a significant medical problem in hospitals, in long-term care facilities\nand in the community. Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile, also known as C. difficile or C. diff, is one of the\nmost common causes of health care-associated infections in U.S. hospitals (Lessa, et al, 2015, New England Journal of\nMedicine). Recent estimates suggest C. difficile approaches 500,000 infections annually in the U.S. and is associated\nwith approximately 20,000 deaths. (Guh, 2020, New England Journal of Medicine). Based on internal estimates\nincluding a recurrence rate of between 20% and 40% among approximately 150,000 patients treated, we believe that the\nannual incidence in the U.S. approaches 600,000 infections and a mortality rate of approximately 9.3%.\nAntibiotics are the gold standard to treat CDI. However, while currently marketed antibiotics achieve a relatively\nhigh initial cure rate, they can fail to eliminate C. difficile, especially drug-resistant strains, in the gut, allowing the\ncontinued growth of the bacteria. This, together with a pronounced detrimental effect on the gut microbiome, leads to\nrecurrence in over 25% of CDI patients after therapy is stopped. A significant unmet need remains for antibiotics that\ncan meaningfully reduce recurrence. According to our recent clinical data, we believe ibezapolstat has the potential to\ncontinue to provide a bactericidal effect combined with a low incidence of recurrence when used to treat CDI.\n23\nAntibiotics provide advantages over the use of antibodies, microbiologics, and vaccines. Antibodies are generally\nonly administered in combination with an antibiotic. Due to high costs and the inability to use antibodies as a first-line\ntreatment, antibodies have gained limited commercial traction and there has only been one antibody treatment for CDI\napproved to date. As of the date of this Form 10-K, there are currently two microbiologics that have been approved for\nmarketing. Safety is a concern with microbiologics, and this course of treatment is only recommended for patients with\nmultiple recurrences of CDI who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments. There are also several vaccines against C.\ndifficile reportedly in late-stage development, but none are currently approved. A vaccine is only likely to be\ncommercially viable as a prevention of recurrent CDI in high-risk patients, if such patients can be identified.\nAdditionally, large numbers of patients are required for clinical trials of vaccines, which could significantly delay the\nclinical development process for and eventual release of any CDI vaccine products currently in development.\nC. difficile has surpassed MRSA, as the leading cause of death among hospitalized patients. CDI is a serious illness\nresulting from infection of the inner lining of the colon by C. difficile bacteria that produce toxins causing inflammation\nof the colon, severe diarrhea and, in the most serious cases, death. Patients typically develop CDI from the use of broad-\nspectrum antibiotics that disrupt normal gastrointestinal (gut) flora, thus allowing C. difficile bacteria to flourish and\nproduce toxins. C. difficile is a spore forming bacterium, creating spores excreted in the environment of the patients that\ncan survive for months on dry surfaces in hospital rooms such as beds and doors, and can contaminate other patients by\nfecal-oral transmission through the hands of healthcare workers.\nWe estimate that, if approved with clinical data consistent with current data generated to date, ibezapolstat could\ncapture over 40% of the CDI market in peak year sales based on the incidence rates noted above. At a preliminary price\nestimate of $3,000 to $3,500 per full course of treatment, this projects out to estimated peak year sales of over $1 billion\nper year in the U.S. alone. The peak market penetration of 40% assumes that there will be at least two treatment options\navailable to treat CDI in addition to ibezapolstat even though only two antibiotics are currently recommended for the\ntreatment of CDI and oral vancomycin has vulnerabilities with its 20%-40% reinfection rate and poor impact on patientsâ\nmicrobiome. The selling price estimate of $3,000 to $3,500 is considered by management to be conservative as it is well\nbelow the price point of fidaxomicin, the most-recent approval in treating CDI which we believe is between $4,500 and\n$5,000 for a full course of treatment.\nManagement believes that this market opportunity is substantial and provides significant upside potential for those\ninvesting at this early stage of development. We believe the size of the market and relatively few treatment options\navailable will drive our market capitalization and availability of financing alternatives as it completes Phase 2 clinical\ntrials successfully.\n24\nIn addition, we believe ibezapolstatâs profile provides an opportunity to develop significant market penetration of\npatients with recurrent infection following use of one of the initial-episode treatment options because of its unique\nmechanism of action.\nCompetition\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong\nemphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific\nresources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including\nmajor pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government\nagencies and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and\ncommercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nMany of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and\ndevelopment, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing\napproved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific\nadvisors and consultants as well as management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for\nclinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Other small or\nearly-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements\nwith large and established companies.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products\nthat are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any\nproducts that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain marketing approvals for their products more rapidly\nthan we obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete in the marketplace may be affected because in some\n25\ncases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of\nmaking branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers.\nThe key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidate and other potential product candidates in\nthe future are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement\nfrom government and other third-party payors.\nThe competition for ibezapolstat include the following:\nâ¢ Several pharmaceutical companies have established themselves in the market for the treatment of CDI and\nseveral other companies are developing investigational antibiotics for the treatment of CDI. We expect these\nproducts, if approved, will compete with ibezapolstat;\nâ¢ Current antibiotic treatments used for patients with CDI include broad spectrum antibiotics like vancomycin\nand metronidazole, both of which are available in generic form in the U.S. Generic antibiotics typically are sold\nat lower prices than branded and currently marketed antibiotics and generally are preferred by managed care\nproviders of health services although we believe we price competitively compared to any currently marketed\nbranded or generic antibiotic to treat patients with CDI based on low cost of goods to manufacture ibezapolstat.\nFurther pricing strategy will follow completion of our clinical development program;\nâ¢ Fidaxomicin (DificidÂ® in the U.S., Dificlirâ¢ in Europe) is approved for the treatment of CDI in the U.S. and\nEurope. Fidaxomicin was originally developed by Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was later acquired by\nCubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (âCubistâ). Cubist was then acquired by Merck & Co., Inc. (âMerckâ) in 2015;\nâ¢ A number of other approaches for the treatment of CDI are in development or have been approved as follows:\nâ¢ Merck developed a monoclonal antibody, bezlotoxumab, and obtained FDA approval for it in 2016 and EMA\napproval in 2016. This antibody neutralizes certain toxins that are produced by C. difficile bacteria and would\nbe an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics.\nâ¢ Fecal biotherapy aims to recolonize the bacteria that comprise the natural gut flora and, according to the 2017\nIDSA Guidelines would be used for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI who have failed to resolve their\ninfection despite treatment attempts with antibiotic agents targeting CDI. Finch Therapeutics recently failed\nwith CP101, its lead therapeutic targeting patients with multiple recurrences of CDI using donor derived stool\nsamples in an oral formulation, to our understanding, and in January 2023 discontinued its Ph3 clinical trial in\nthis area.\nâ¢ Fecal biotherapy approaches in development include SER-109 (âVOWSTâ), which has now been FDA\napproved and marketed by Seres Therapeutics, Inc., is an oral microbiome therapeutic for the prevention of\nrecurrent C. difficile infection in adults with multiply recurrent CDI only after antibiotic therapy is\nadministered. The FDA granted SER-109 both Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations.\nAlthough VOWST was recently introduced to the market, we believe its penetration has been lower than\nexpected and the price point is high at approximately $17,500 per full course of treatment.\nâ¢ RebyotaÂ® (fecal microbiota, live-jslm) was recently approved by FDA, and marketed by Ferring\nPharmaceuticals, is a fecal microbiota product which is prepared from stool donated by qualified individuals\nand delivered via enema for the prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) in adults. This\nwould only be used after a standard antibiotic therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate CDI, and we believe\nthe price point is approximately $12,500 per full course of therapy.\nâ¢ CRS3123 (Crestone Inc) is a novel small molecule that selectively inhibits methionyl-tRNA synthetase of C.\ndifficile and is reported on clinicaltrials.gov as recruiting in a Phase 2 clinical trial with a primary completion\ndate that was targeted for December 2021 but is listed as currently ongoing on the Crestone website.\n26\nâ¢ MGB-BP-3 (MGB Biopharma) is a novel synthetic polyamide active against Gram-positive pathogens and\nbinds to the minor groove of DNA. MGB announced that it has completed a dose-ranging Phase 2 clinical trial\nin 2020 but there are no indications publicly that MGB BioPharma has commenced Ph3.\nâ¢ No new antibiotics in clinical development have shown improvement in either initial clinical cure (âICRâ) or\nsustained clinical response (âSCRâ) in comparison to currently marketed antibiotics. The data in the chart\nbelow constitute comparisons of data from prior clinical trials published in scientific journals for each listed\nantibiotic or antibiotic candidate and does not incorporate data, if any, from any control arm(s) that may be or\nmay have been required to seek and obtain FDA approval. The data listed for ibezapolstat are from the Phase 2a\nclinical trial where no comparator agent was used. The only comparative data for ibezapolstat in clinical trials\ncurrently relate only to comparisons of the impact on the microbiome for ibezapolstat and vancomycin but do\nnot compare clinical cure rates. All data presented is based on identical clinical endpoints used for ICR and\nSCR.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe attribute our success to the following competitive strengths:\n(i) We have a novel mechanism of action which we believe will be highly advantageous given the continuing\nrate of recurrent CDI with currently available treatment options and the rising prevalence of antimicrobial\nresistance;\n(ii) Since ibezapolstatâs molecular structure and mechanism of action are unrelated to any other antimicrobial\nchemical class, its use is not expected to foster the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to other classes\nof antibiotics;\n(iii) The Phase 1 Trial showed highly selective activity against C. difficile bacteria with minimal disruption to\nthe gut flora as it is poorly soluble which has been corroborated by the data from the microbiome analysis;\n27\n(iv) The Phase 2a clinical trial data demonstrated a 100% cure rate at end of treatment and 100% sustained\nclinical response, in each case, in the ten patients who were enrolled and was terminated early based on\nthe recommendation of our SAB based on the efficacy data and safety and tolerability profile;\n(v) Microbiome data from Phase 2a trial patients demonstrated complete eradication of colonic C. difficile by\nday three of treatment with ibezapolstat as well as the observed overgrowth of healthy gut microbiota,\nActinobacteria and Firmicute phyla species, both during and after treatment. Significantly, emerging data\nshow an increased concentration of secondary bile acids which is known to correlate with a low risk of\nreinfection. Moreover, a decrease in primary bile acids and the favorable increase in the ratio of\nsecondary-to-primary bile acids provides more scientific evidence suggesting recurrences may be very\nlow in future trials. The Phase 2b trial demonstrated positive comparative microbiome data where\nibezapolstat, but not vancomycin, consistently preserved and allowed regrowth of key gut bacterial\nspecies believed to confer health benefits including to prevent recurrence of CDI.\n(vi) To date, ibezapolstat has shown an excellent human safety profile;\n(vii) Our designation by the FDA of Qualified Infectious Disease (QIDP) status and Fast Track designation\nprovides significant benefits to our development of ibezapolstat. We have significant existing patent\ncoverage in the worldâs largest pharmaceutical markets (U.S., Europe, Japan and Canada) extending to\nSeptember 2030 in the United States and September 2030 in foreign markets. There is also the possibility\nto extend those patents thereafter;\n(viii) We have a simple and low-cost process of manufacturing which is expected to yield cost of goods of less\nthan 5% of the anticipated retail price; and\n(ix) We successfully completed the Phase 2b clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Phase 2b trial\nwas originally designed to be a non-inferiority (NI) trial and later amended to include an interim efficacy\nanalysis with review by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The decision to end the\ntrial early based on blinded clinical observations obviated the need for an interim analysis, IDMC review,\nand NI assessment. We determined, in consultation with our clinical and statistical experts, that presenting\nclinical cure rates for the primary efficacy endpoint is the most appropriate representation for the clinical\nactivity of ibezapolstat in treating CDI.\n(x) The overall observed Clinical Cure rate in the combined Phase 2 trials in patients with CDI was 96%\n(25 out of 26 patients), based on 10 out of 10 patients (100%) in Phase 2a in the Modified Intent to Treat\nPopulation, plus 15 out of 16 (94%) patients in Phase 2b in the Per Protocol Population, who experienced\nClinical Cure during treatment with ibezapolstat. Ibezapolstat was well-tolerated, with three patients each\nexperiencing one mild adverse event assessed by the blinded investigator to be drug-related. All three\nevents were gastrointestinal in nature and resolved without treatment. There were no drug-related\ntreatment withdrawals or no drug-related serious adverse events, or other safety findings of concern. In the\nPhase 2b vancomycin control arm, 14 out of 14 patients experienced clinical cure. We believe that based\non the pooled Phase 2 ibezapolstat clinical cure rate of 96% and the historical vancomycin cure rate of\napproximately 81% (VancocinÂ® Prescribing Information, January 2021), we will demonstrate non-\ninferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin in Phase 3 trials in accordance with the applicable FDA\nGuidance for Industry (October, 2022).\n(xi) We announced the sustained clinical cure data in December 2023 and the cumulative EOT and SCC data\nare summarized below:\n28\n(xii) On January 17, 2024, we announced positive microbiology and microbiome comparative data to\nvancomycin from the Phase 2b trial. Ibezapolstat outperformed vancomycin showing eradication of fecal\nC. difficile at Day 3 of treatment in 15 of 16 treated patients (94%), versus vancomycin which had\neradication of C. difficile in 10 of 14 treated patients (71%). Ibezapolstat, but not vancomycin,\nconsistently preserved and allowed regrowth of key gut bacterial species believed to confer health benefits\nincluding to prevent recurrent of CDI.\nIntellectual Property and Market Exclusivity\nWe have a U.S. patent (U.S. Patent Numbers 8,796,292), with claims that cover ibezapolstat that expires in\nSeptember 2030. We believe this patent is important because it has composition claims for ibezapolstat, in addition to\nclaims that cover other disubstituted purine compounds, compositions, and methods of inhibiting bacterial growth. This\npatent may be subject to extension subject to certain circumstances.\nFor ibezapolstat, we also have one composition-of-matter patent in each of Europe, Japan and Canada. All of these\nnon-U.S. patents expire in September 2030, subject to extension under certain circumstances.\nIn addition, we have filed two provisional patent applications and an international patent application in 2023\ncovering methods and compositions for promoting microbiome health and for achieving and/or maintaining healthy\nproportions of gut microflora. We also filed foreign applications in 2023 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel,\nJapan, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore covering methods of treating C. difficile infection and preventing recurrence\nwhile simultaneously promoting microbiome health.\nWe believe the commercial opportunity for ibezapolstat is best protected by regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. that\nhas been made available for new chemical entities (five years) and QIDP designated products (five years).\nThe FDA has granted QIDP status for the oral use of ibezapolstat to treat CDI. QIDP status is provided by the FDA\nunder the GAIN Act and provides incentives for us as the sponsor of the ibezapolstat development program, including\nFDA priority review for the first application submitted for the QIDP, eligibility for âfast trackâ status and extension of\nstatutory exclusivity periods in the U.S. for an additional five years upon FDA approval of ibezapolstat for the treatment\nof CDI. In January 2019, the FDA approved âfast trackâ designation for ibezapolstat for the oral treatment of CDI.\nAccordingly, we will have 10 years of regulatory exclusivity on the oral use of ibezapolstat to treat CDI from the date of\nFDA marketing approval. For geographies outside the U.S., we believe the following regulatory exclusivity is available:\nEU and UK: 8-years data exclusivity; plus 2 additional years of marketing exclusivity plus 1 year for additional\n29\nindication (e.g., pediatric use); Japan: 8-years post-approval data exclusivity period for NCE; Canada: 8-years data\nexclusivity plus 6 months extension for pediatric use.\nWe believe the patent and regulatory coverage already in place provides strong protection for the commercialization\nof ibezapolstat and we will continue to consider additional patent submissions as we review available pre-clinical and\nclinical data as it becomes available throughout the development program.\nWe have obtained three U.S. patents and one Israeli patent on ACX-375C, our second antibiotic program, and have\na fourth U.S. patent application and multiple foreign applications pending for ACX-375C. Our three U.S. patents and\nIsraeli patent on ACX-375C include composition-of-matter, surface coating, and method of use claims. Absent any\npatent extensions, these patents will expire in December 2039. We anticipate that the patent protection will be further\nsupported by regulatory exclusivity available to new classes of antibiotics treating life-threatening infections (QIDP\nDesignation by FDA â 5 years) and New Chemical Entity Designation (5 years). We anticipate filing for and receiving\nQIDP Designation as well as âFast Trackâ with FDA in the next 24 months for ACX-375C, both of which designations\nhave been granted by FDA for ibezapolstat, our lead antibiotic program.\nGAIN Exclusivity for Antibiotics\nOur regulatory strategy includes targeting QIDP designation by the FDA under the GAIN Act. Congress passed the\nGAIN Act as part of FDASIA in 2012 to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that\ntreat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections.\nPotential External Positive Drivers for Sector\nFuture external funding opportunities change over time but include the following:\nPASTEUR Act. The PASTEUR Act is legislation currently in the U.S. congress which, if approved, would provide\nâpullâ incentives in the U.S. for developers of new classes of antibiotics that target a critical need. According to the\nPasteur Act, the US Department of Health and Human Services would pay a subscription payment for eligible products\nof $750 million to $3 billion over a ten-year period and patients would receive the drug at no cost. In addition, HHS\nwould provide transitional support to fund Phase 3 clinical trials and manufacturing requirements for certain innovative\nantimicrobial drugs.\nAMR Action Fund. The AMR Action Fund was created by the Antimicrobial Resistance Congress to generate\ninterest to develop new classes of antibiotics to treat priority pathogens on the WHO and CDC priority pathogens list.\nThe AMR Action Fund is funded by over 20 fully integrated worldwide pharmaceutical companies which have pledged\nover $1 billion to fund clinical activities of up to 15 sponsors of new classes of antibiotics to treat priority pathogens.\nDISARM Act. The DISARM Act is legislation currently in the U.S. Congress which would remove the financial\ndisincentives now in place for prescribers of antibiotics to use novel agents possibly more efficacious than older, less\neffective antibiotics that are prescribed at a lower cost. Accordingly, treating physicians would have the opportunity to\ntreat patients with infectious disease with the most effective agents thereby enhancing patient outcomes as well as\nreducing the cost burden on public health.\nEU Pull Incentives. Given the adoption of pull incentives for certain critical antibiotics adopted in the U.K. and\nunder consideration in the U.S., the EU currently is considering adopting certain pull incentives specifically to\nincentivize sponsors of key antibiotic development programs in the EU. The EU also is considering the creation and\nfunding of a new regulatory organization similar to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority\n(âBARDAâ), which is a division of the HHS which, among other things, is responsible to protect the U.S. against\npandemic threats.\n30\nPipeline Products\nA series of novel antibacterial molecules derived from ACX-375C appear to share the same mechanism of action\nwith ibezapolstat, i.e. they inhibit the pol IIIC enzyme in certain Gram-positive bacterial cells including both sensitive\nand resistant C. difficile, MRSA, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, PRSP and other resistant bacteria. Further\ncharacterization and testing of these molecules are ongoing.\nThis diverse series of new agents which are believed to bind pol IIIC and thereby prevent it from synthesizing new\nDNA, as shown below, where the gray area is the pol IIIC enzyme and the therapeutic molecule occupies the critical\nbinding pocket.\nCompounds in this series have demonstrated potent activity against clinically important pathogens including\nminimum inhibitory concentration values (âMIC valuesâ) against MRSA, VRE and PRSP of 1 â 4 Âµg/mL. Further\ncharacterization and testing in animal models are ongoing.\nWe have pioneered the clinical development of a pol IIIC inhibitor as a clinically valid bacterial target. Ibezapolstat\ncured 10 of 10 (100%) patients after 10-days treatment with no recurrences during the 30-day follow up period in a\nPhase 2a trial for C. difficile infection (CDI). Gut microbiome analyses further showed that potentially beneficial\nbacterial species are selectively preserved in CDI patients during treatment with ibezapolstat; the pol IIIC Mechanism-\nof-Action (MOA) suggests that this is a class effect.\nWe are also developing a systemic pol IIIC Gram-positive selective spectrum (GPSSÂ®) oral and IV antibiotic. The\ninitial hit ACX 375C is pan-active against wild-type and drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., MRSA, VRE and\nPRSP). We have synthesized and tested >600 novel analogs targeting pol IIIC. To date, 20 novel compounds with MIC\nvalues â¤1 Î¼g/mL for both MRSA and VRE have been identified (see Table below).\nMIC Range MRSA VRE MRSA and VRE\n< 1 Âµg/mL 20 compounds 65 compounds 20 compounds\n>1 to <2 Âµg/mL 74 compounds 111 compounds 74 compounds\n>2 to < 4 Âµg/mL 82 compounds 92 compounds 82 compounds\nThe Hit-to-Lead program produced improvements in solubility, cytotoxicity, and protein binding with a\ncomprehensive SAR understanding. Pol IIIC inhibitors have a novel MOA and activity of ACX-375 against MRSA and\nVRE bacteria was not impacted by vancomycin-, daptomycin-, or linezolid-resistance. Pol IIIC is absent in Gram-\nnegative bacteria and mammalian cells.\n31\nNew analogs show improved characteristics directly related to clinical therapeutic utility: improved solubility for IV\nformulation, improved safety vs. HepG2, as an initial predictor of pharmacologic safety, and decreased plasma protein\nbinding, to further improve in vivo efficacy.\nThese analogs have maintained potent MICs against MRSA, MSSA, PRSP, E. faecalis and VRE.\nIn vivo pharmacology studies have been encouraging but are not yet determinative. PK studies in mice demonstrate\noral and IV exposures sufficient for efficacy testing in infection models. Oral bioavailability of 31-59% was\ndemonstrated by 10 different analogs when administered as a simple liquid formulation. Oral bioavailability will\nimprove further through formulation optimization.\nThe solubility of pol IIIC inhibitors has been improved by prodrug efforts, which support the viability of an IV\nformulation. Phosphate prodrugs for two compounds showed rapid conversion from inactive prodrug to active parent\ndrug with good exposures following IV and PO dosing in mice. Solubility was improved to the range of 1 mg/mL, which\nis viable for IV formulation.\nEfficacy has been demonstrated in 4 different mouse models involving different body sites including the critically\nimportant lung and thigh. The models were: MRSA peritonitis (3 analogs >60% protection, median survival >7 days);\nMRSA thigh (neutropenic; 1 analog 1.28 log10 CFU reduction); VRE thigh (neutropenic; 4 analogs 1.21-1.94 log10\nCFU reduction); and PRSP lung (neutropenic; 5 analogs 1.03-1.69 log10 CFU reduction). Oral efficacy was\ndemonstrated in 3 models. Lead optimization will seek to further improve efficacy, especially in the thigh model which\nis a simulation of the initial clinical indication.\nOne analog tested in a battery of safety screens (Eurofins 44 panel, CiPA panel, and CYP inhibition assays) showed\nno liabilities. As a pilot study, two analogs were tested in 5-day repeat dose studies in mice at 50 mg/kg TID\n(150 mg/day). One analog showed no HepG2 cytotoxicity (IC50 >128 Âµg/mL) in vitro, while the 2nd showed effects\n(IC50 30 Âµg/mL). There were no adverse effects observed in life, no changes in body weight, and no significant gross\nnecropsy findings for either compound. Serum chemistry showed no effects (treated vs. control; n=5/group) for the 1st\ncompound (IC50 >128 Âµg/mL) while the 2nd (IC50 30 Âµg/mL) showed elevated liver enzymes for one analog in several\nmice dosed IV and PO. These results were encouraging since the HepG2 in vitro assay is used as a marker for potential\nin vivo toxicity.\nSpontaneous resistance frequency is low (<3.17x10-9 and <1.30x10-9 for MRSA and VRE, respectively, at\n4xMIC), and there is no cross-resistance with other antibiotics. We are studying potential MOR (Mechanism of\nResistance) to pol IIIC inhibitors using whole genome sequencing.\nIn collaboration with two laboratories at Leiden University Medical Center under a Dutch government grant, the\n3-D structure of pol IIIC from MRSA, VRE and PRSP alone and bound to Acurx inhibitors will be studied using\ncryo-EM/X-ray crystallography. Using this, novel analogs with improved binding will be tested.\nThe Acurx Lead Optimization program is modifying existing leads to develop compounds with improved potency,\nless plasma protein binding, and increased exposures. The Lead Optimization Program includes developing an improved\nrapid assay of pol IIIC inhibitor activity (Ki) for MRSA, VRE, and PRSP; determining the 3 D structure of Acurx\ncompounds bound to pol IIIC enzymes for improved SAR; developing/testing novel oral formulations to improve\nbioavailability; and testing prodrug compounds in animal infection/safety models. Oral and IV candidates from Lead\nOptimization will then advance to preclinical testing and Phase 1 SAD (Single Ascending Dose) / MAD (Multiple\nAscending Dose) trials.\nThe initial clinical indication is targeting gram-positive acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections\n(âABSSSIâ); subsequent trials may target confirmed Gram-positive infections for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia\n(âHABPâ), bloodstream infections/endocarditis, diabetic foot infections, and/or osteomyelitis. ABSSSI is an ideal\nclinical indication for a pan active gram-positive drug since the clinical end points, comparators, and execution are well\nestablished.\n32\nThese bacterial targets (MRSA, VRE and PRSP) involve an incidence of approximately six million patients per year\nin the U.S. alone. Based on a review of other antibiotics currently marketed to treat these bacterial infections, our early\nestimate of peak year sales potential is 4% to 5% of this annual incidence and a peak year sales potential of\napproximately $1 billion.\nThe priority lead indication and dosage form is for oral treatment of bacterial infections caused by MSSA and\nMRSA, which is the leading cause of hospital based bacterial infections in the U.S.\nPatents extend out to FYE 2039; Eligible for FDA QIDP / Fast Track Designations which provide 10 years of\nregulatory exclusivity in U.S. and other regulatory exclusivity periods Ex-US.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of March 15, 2024, we had four full-time employees.

Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, the section of this Annual Report Form 10-K entitled âManagementâs Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationâ and our financial statements and related notes, before\ninvesting in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional\n33\nrisks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important\nfactors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and prospects could be\nmaterially harmed. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your\ninvestment.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision.\nThese risks include the following:\nâ¢ We are a clinical-stage company and have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate\nour current business and predict our future performance.\nâ¢ We have incurred significant net losses in each period since our inception and anticipate that we will continue\nto incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nâ¢ Our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to\nassess our future viability.\nâ¢ We may need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced\nto delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nâ¢ Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us\nto relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nâ¢ We are reliant on the success of our lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, which we are developing for the\ntreatment of CDI. If we are unable to commercialize ibezapolstat, or experience significant delays in doing so,\nour business will be materially harmed.\nâ¢ If serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of ibezapolstat or any\nother product candidate, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate.\nâ¢ Ibezapolstat or our other product candidates may never achieve sufficient market acceptance even if we obtain\nregulatory approval.\nâ¢ We are exposed to product liability, and non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial\nfinancial burden upon us, should lawsuits be filed against us.\nâ¢ Our current and future operations substantially depend on our management team and our ability to hire other\nkey personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nâ¢ Our failure to complete or meet key milestones relating to the development of our technologies and proposed\nproducts and formulations would significantly impair our financial condition.\nâ¢ We will compete with larger and better capitalized companies, and competitors in the drug development or\npharmaceutical industries may develop competing products which outperform or supplant our proposed\nproducts.\nâ¢ A pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially\nand adversely affect our business.\nâ¢ Global, market and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share\nprice.\nâ¢ Because results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any\nproduct candidate we advance may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory\napproval. Moreover, interim, âtop-line,â and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or\npublish may change, or the perceived product profile may be negatively impacted, as more patient data or\nadditional endpoints (including efficacy and safety) are analyzed.\nâ¢ If clinical trials of our lead product candidate fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the\nFDA, or the EMA, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience\ndelays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete the development and commercialization of\nibezapolstat or any other product candidate.\nâ¢ If we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential\nmarketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nâ¢ We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, be\nunable to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nâ¢ Risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our product development\nshould we elect to extend development outside the U.S.\n34\nâ¢ Our results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and\nregulatory actions.\nâ¢ If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to\nmarket and sell our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing ibezapolstat or any other\nproduct candidate if and when such product candidates are approved.\nâ¢ We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and our\nongoing clinical trials, and expect to continue to do so for additional clinical trials and ultimately for\ncommercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of\nour product candidates or drugs or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair\nour development or commercialization efforts.\nâ¢ If ultimate users of our product candidates are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party\npayers, or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our proposed products may be limited\nand we may not achieve material revenues.\nâ¢ We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents.\nâ¢ Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from\ntheir normal responsibilities.\nâ¢ Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital\nappreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nâ¢ The price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nâ¢ Our largest stockholders will exercise significant influence over our company for the foreseeable future,\nincluding the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\nâ¢ Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption\nand/or financial loss.\nâ¢ We may fail to comply with evolving privacy and data protection laws, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nâ¢ There may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to\nprevent error or fraud may materially harm us.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are a clinical-stage company and have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our\ncurrent business and predict our future performance.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that was formed in July 2017. We acquired the rights to our lead\nproduct candidate, ibezapolstat, in February 2018 and we have a limited operating history. Our operations to date have\nbeen limited to securing our initial product candidate, generating a second product candidate in-house, conducting\nclinical and regulatory development for our lead program and raising capital. We have no products approved for\ncommercial sale and have not generated any revenue.\nInvesting in an early-stage company with limited history, financial or otherwise, includes a high degree of risk. As\nan early-stage company, our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties\nfrequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. We have generated losses since inception and\nwe expect to continue to run at a loss for several years until our initial program, or one of our pipeline products, is\napproved by the FDA or another worldwide regulatory body. We expect to incur substantial operating expenses over the\nnext several years as our product development activities and related costs increase. No assurance can be given that we\nwill be able to successfully implement any or all of our business plan, or if implemented, that we will accomplish the\ndesired objectives, including achieving profitability. Our short history as an operating company makes any assessment of\nour future success or viability subject to significant uncertainty. We will encounter risks and difficulties frequently\nexperienced by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving fields. If we do not address these risks successfully, our\nbusiness will suffer.\n35\nWe have incurred significant net losses in each period since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to\nincur net losses in for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred significant losses in each period since our inception, including net losses of\n$14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have\nnot commercialized any products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. We expect these losses to\nincrease as we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing\noperations, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, scale-up manufacturing capabilities and hire additional\npersonnel to support the development of our product candidates and to enhance our operational, financial and\ninformation management systems.\nA critical aspect of our strategy is to invest significantly in our clinical and regulatory development for our lead\nprogram. To become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize products with significant\nmarket potential, which we may never achieve. Even if we succeed in commercializing one or more of these product\ncandidates, we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future relating to our substantial research and\ndevelopment expenditures to develop our product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties,\ncomplications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses\nwill depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses\nand expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholdersâ equity and working\ncapital. Further, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, such that a\nperiod to period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. If we\ndo achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure\nto become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair our ability to raise capital,\nmaintain our discovery and preclinical development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations and may\nrequire us to raise additional capital that may dilute your ownership interest. A decline in the value of our company\ncould also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm noted in its report accompanying our financial statements for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023 that we had suffered significant accumulated deficit and had negative operating\ncash flows and that the development and commercialization of our product candidates are expected to require substantial\nexpenditures. We have not yet generated any material revenues from our operations to fund our activities, and are\ntherefore dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. There can be no assurance that we will succeed\nin obtaining the necessary financing to continue our operations. As a result, our independent registered public accounting\nfirm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not\ninclude any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we cannot successfully continue as a\ngoing concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in our common stock.\nWe may need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to\ndelay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue research\nand development and initiate additional clinical trials of our product candidates and seek regulatory approval for these\nand potentially other product candidates. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates,\nwe expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and\ndistribution. In particular, the costs that may be required for the manufacture of any product candidate that receives\nmarketing approval may be substantial. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection\nwith our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced\nto delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\n36\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $7.5 million in cash. In June 2021, we completed the IPO for net\ncash proceeds of $14.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In\nJuly 2022, we completed a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement for net cash proceeds of\n$3.7 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. In May 2023, we completed a registered direct\noffering and concurrent private placement for net cash proceeds of $3.5 million after deducting placement agent fees and\noffering expenses. In November 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established an âAt-the-Market\" offering\n(the âATM Programâ), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through A.G.P./Alliance Global\nPartners, as sales agent, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. As of the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, we sold 698,121 shares of our common stock under the ATM Program, at a weighted-\naverage price of $3.76 per share, raising $2.6 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of $2.4 million after deducting\ncommissions to the sales agent and other ATM Program related expenses. There remains approximately $14.4 million\navailable for future sales of shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement. Other than the Sales Agreement, we\ncurrently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds. We believe that, based upon our current operating\nplan, our existing capital resources, will not be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations for at least 12 months from\nthe issuance of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our future capital requirements and the\nperiod for which we expect our existing resources to support our operations may vary significantly from what we expect.\nOur monthly spending levels vary based on new and ongoing research and development and other corporate activities.\nBecause the length of time and activities associated with successful research and development of our product candidates\nis highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved\nmarketing and commercialization activities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nâ¢ the timing, progress, and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates;\nâ¢ our ability to manufacture sufficient clinical supply of our products candidates and the costs thereof;\nâ¢ discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the design and conduct of our clinical trials and the costs, timing\nand outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\nâ¢ the cost and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales\nand distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\nâ¢ the costs of any other product candidates or technologies we pursue;\nâ¢ our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial\nterms of such agreements;\nâ¢ the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of any product candidates for which we receive marketing\napproval; and\nâ¢ the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our\nintellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any additional\nfundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability\nto develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our ability to raise additional funding will depend on financial,\neconomic and market conditions and other factors, over which we may have no or limited control, including the conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. In addition, our ability to\nobtain future funding when needed through equity financings, debt financings or strategic collaborations may be\nparticularly challenging in light of the uncertainties and circumstances regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We have no\ncommitted source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms\nacceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of\nour product candidates or other research and development initiatives. We could be required to seek collaborators for our\nproduct candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might\notherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our product candidates in markets\nwhere we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves.\nAny of the above events could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n37\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to\nrelinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash\nneeds through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships, and alliances\nand licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities,\nyour ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect\nyour rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and\ncould involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability\nto acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to\nconduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing\narrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or\ngrant licenses on terms unfavorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings\nwhen needed (including if we are unable to do so as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), we may be required to delay,\nlimit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and\nmarket product candidates that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves.\nWe are reliant on the success of our lead product candidate, ibezapolstat, which we are developing for the treatment\nof CDI. If we are unable to commercialize ibezapolstat, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will\nbe materially harmed.\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which may not occur for several years, if ever, currently depends heavily\non the successful development and commercialization of ibezapolstat. The success of ibezapolstat will depend on a\nnumber of factors, including the following:\nâ¢ successful completion of clinical development;\nâ¢ receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\nâ¢ establishing commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\nâ¢ obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;\nâ¢ protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\nâ¢ establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\nâ¢ launching commercial sales of ibezapolstat, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with\nothers;\nâ¢ acceptance of ibezapolstat, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\nâ¢ effectively competing with other CDI therapies; and\nâ¢ maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of ibezapolstat following approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays\nor an inability to successfully commercialize ibezapolstat, which would materially harm our business.\nIf serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of ibezapolstat or any other\nproduct candidate, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate.\nOur product candidates are in clinical development and its risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when our\nproduct candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. If our product candidates\nare associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their\ndevelopment or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other\ncharacteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.\n38\nMany compounds that initially show promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side\neffects or other safety issues that prevented further development. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any\nclinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidate will be harmed and our\nability to generate product revenues from such product candidate will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these\noccurrences could materially harm our business.\nIbezapolstat or our other product candidates may never achieve sufficient market acceptance even if we obtain\nregulatory approval.\nIf ibezapolstat or any of our other future product candidates receive marketing approval, such products may\nnonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical\ncommunity. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product\nrevenues or revenue from collaboration agreements or any profits from operations. The degree of market acceptance of\nour product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\nâ¢ the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments or competitive products;\nâ¢ the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\nâ¢ the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\nâ¢ convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\nâ¢ the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these\ntherapies;\nâ¢ obtaining regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing;\nâ¢ our ability to timely and effectively manufacture, market and distribute our products, either on our own or\nthrough third parties;\nâ¢ pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers such as insurance companies, health\nmaintenance organizations and other health plan administrators;\nâ¢ the timing of any such marketing approval in relation to other product approvals;\nâ¢ support from patient advocacy groups;\nâ¢ our ability to attract corporate partners, including pharmaceutical companies, to assist in commercializing our\nproposed formulations or products; and\nâ¢ any restrictions on concomitant use of other medications.\nIf our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by the relevant constituencies, or adequate pricing,\nwe may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable.\nWe are exposed to product liability, and non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial\nfinancial burden upon us, should lawsuits be filed against us.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing,\nmanufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We expect that such claims are likely to be\nasserted against us at some point, although we do carry product liability and clinical trial insurance to mitigate this risk.\nIn addition, the use in our clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the subsequent sale of these\nformulations or products by us or our potential collaborators may cause us to bear a portion of or all product liability\nrisks. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n39\nOur current and future operations substantially depend on our management team and our ability to hire other key\npersonnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nOur business does and will depend in substantial part on the continued services of David P. Luci,\nRobert J. DeLuccia and Robert G. Shawah. The loss of the services of any of these individuals would significantly\nimpede implementation and execution of our business strategy and result in the failure to reach our goals. We do not\ncarry key person life insurance on any member of our management, which would leave us uncompensated for the loss of\nany member of our management.\nOur future financial condition and ability to achieve profitability will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing our operations. There is a risk that we\nwill be unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and our failure to do so\nmay severely damage our prospects.\nOur failure to complete or meet key milestones relating to the development of our technologies and proposed products\nand formulations would significantly impair our financial condition.\nIn order to be commercially viable, we must research, develop and obtain regulatory approval to manufacture,\nintroduce, market and distribute formulations or products incorporating our technologies. For each drug that we\nformulate, we must meet a number of critical developmental milestones, including:\nâ¢ demonstration of the benefit of each specific drug through our drug delivery technologies;\nâ¢ demonstration, through non-clinical and clinical trials, that our drug delivery technologies are safe and\neffective; and\nâ¢ establishment of a viable current good manufacturing process (âcGMPâ) capable of potential scale-up.\nThe estimated required capital and time-frames necessary to achieve these developmental milestones is subject to\ninherent risks, many of which are beyond our control. As such, we may not be able to achieve these or similar milestones\nfor any of our proposed product candidates or other product candidates in the future. Our failure to meet these or other\ncritical milestones would adversely affect our financial condition.\nConducting and completing the clinical trials necessary for FDA approval is costly and subject to intense regulatory\nscrutiny as well as the risk of failing to meet the primary endpoint of such trials. We will not be able to commercialize\nand sell our proposed products and formulations without completing such trials.\nIn order to conduct clinical trials that are necessary to obtain approval by the FDA to market a formulation or\nproduct, it is necessary to receive clearance from the FDA to conduct such clinical trials. The FDA can halt clinical trials\nat any time for safety reasons or because we or our clinical investigators did not follow the FDAâs requirements for\nconducting clinical trials. If we are unable to receive clearance to conduct clinical trials or the trials are permanently\nhalted by the FDA, we would not be able to achieve any revenue from such product as it is illegal to sell any drug or\nmedical device for human consumption or use without FDA approval. Moreover, there is a risk that our clinical trials\nwill fail to meet their primary endpoints, which would make them unacceptable in having the subject product approved\nby the FDA. If this were to occur, such event would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\n40\nWe will compete with larger and better capitalized companies, and competitors in the drug development or\npharmaceutical industries may develop competing products which outperform or supplant our proposed products.\nDrug companies and/or other technology companies have developed (and are currently marketing in competition\nwith us), have sought to develop and may in the future seek to develop and market similar product candidates and drug\ndelivery technologies which may become more accepted by the marketplace or which may supplant our technology\nentirely. In addition, many of our current competitors are, and future competitors may be, significantly larger and better\nfinanced than we are, thus giving them a significant advantage over us. Our competitors may also have significantly\ngreater expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining\nregulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting\nand retaining qualified scientific advisors and consultants as well as management personnel and establishing clinical trial\nsites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for,\nour programs. Other small or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through\ncollaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We may be unable to respond to competitive forces\npresently in the marketplace which would severely impact our business.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth and expansion or implement our business strategies, in which\ncase our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe expected growth of our business, if it occurs, will place increased demands on our management, operational and\nadministrative resources. These increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business\nless effectively which, in turn, could cause a deterioration in our financial performance and negatively impact our\ngrowth. Any planned growth will also require that we continually monitor and upgrade our management information and\nother systems, as well as our infrastructure.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our business and achieve our goals. Even if we succeed in\nestablishing new strategic partnerships, we cannot assure that we will achieve planned revenue or profitability levels in\nthe time periods estimated by us, or at all. If any of these initiatives fails to achieve or is unable to sustain acceptable\nrevenue and profitability levels, we may incur significant costs.\nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and\nadversely affect our business.\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. Notably, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations or those of our\ncollaborators, contractors, suppliers, CROs, clinical sites, CMOs and other material business relations and governmental\nagencies will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence,\nincluding the duration and severity of the outbreak, new information that will emerge concerning the severity of the virus\nand the actions to contain it or treat its impact, among others. Previously, our clinical trial operations were directly and\nindirectly adversely impacted, and could continue to be directly and indirectly adversely impacted, by the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe spread of COVID-19 could also have adverse economic impacts to us. While the potential economic impact\nbrought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic, have been, and continue to be, difficult to assess or predict,\nthe spread of COVID-19 has caused a broad impact globally.\nGlobal, market and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nThe results of our operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, the global\nfinancial markets and the global political conditions. The U.S. and global economies are facing growing inflation, higher\ninterest rates and a potential recession. Furthermore, a severe or prolonged economic downturn, including a recession or\ndepression resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or political disruption such as the war between Ukraine and\nRussia and the conflict involving Israel and Hamas could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened\ndemand for our programs and development candidates, if approved, relationships with any vendors or business partners\n41\nlocated in affected geographies and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A\nweak or declining economy or political disruption, including any international trade disputes, could also strain our\nmanufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for\nour potential products. Any of the foregoing could seriously harm our business, and we cannot anticipate all of the ways\nin which the political or economic climate and financial market conditions could seriously harm our business.\nIncreases in inflation could raise our costs for commodities, labor, materials and services and other costs required to\ngrow and operate our business, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial\ncondition. Additionally, increases in inflation, along with the uncertainties surrounding geopolitical developments and\nglobal supply chain disruptions, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty\nabout the interest rate environment. A failure to adequately respond to these risks could have a material adverse impact\non our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In response to high levels of inflation and recession fears,\nthe U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England have raised, and may continue to raise,\ninterest rates and implement fiscal policy interventions. Even if these interventions lower inflation, they may also reduce\neconomic growth rates, create a recession, and have other similar effects.\nThe U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of credit-rating downgrades and\neconomic slowdowns, or a recession in the U.S. Although U.S. lawmakers have previously passed legislation to raise\nthe federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, there is a history of ratings agencies lowering or threatening to lower the\nlong-term sovereign credit rating on the United States given such uncertainty. On August 1, 2023, Fitch Ratings\ndowngraded the U.S.âs long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA as a result of these repeated\ndebt ceiling and budget deficit concerns. The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. governmentâs\nsovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and\neconomic conditions.\nIf the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary equity or debt financing more difficult to\nsecure, more costly or more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable\nterms could harm our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon\nplans with respect to our business, including clinical development plans. Further, recent developments in the banking\nindustry could adversely affect our business. If the financial institutions with which we do business enter receivership or\nbecome insolvent in the future, there is no guarantee that the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, will intercede to provide us and other depositors with access to\nbalances in excess of the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit, that we would be able to access our existing cash, cash\nequivalents and investments, that we would be able to maintain any required letters of credit or other credit support\narrangements, or that we would be able to adequately fund our business for a prolonged period of time or at all, any of\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot\npredict the impact that the high market volatility and instability of the banking sector more broadly could have on\neconomic activity and our business in particular. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service\nproviders, manufacturers or other third parties with which we conduct business may not survive difficult economic\ntimes, including the current global situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflict between\nRussia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, the instability of the banking sector, and the uncertainty\nassociated with current worldwide economic conditions, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating\ngoals on schedule and on budget.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe believe that climate change has the potential to negatively affect our business and results of operations, cash\nflows and prospects. We are exposed to physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels), risks in\ntransitioning to a low-carbon economy (such as additional legal or regulatory requirements, changes in technology,\n42\nmarket risk and reputational risk) and social and human effects (such as population dislocations and harm to health and\nwell-being) associated with climate change. These risks can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).\nThe adverse impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of natural disasters and extreme\nweather events such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires (exacerbated by drought), flooding, and extreme heat. Extreme\nweather and sea-level rise pose physical risks to our facilities as well as those of our suppliers. Such risks include losses\nincurred as a result of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by\nsuch natural disasters and extreme weather events. Other potential physical impacts due to climate change include\nreduced access to high-quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, which could impact future product\ndevelopment. These risks could disrupt our operations and supply chains, which may result in increased costs.\nNew legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to the implications of a changing\nclimate and its effects on the environment. These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could result in us\nbeing subject to new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas\nemissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency, upgrade of facilities to meet\nnew building codes, and the redesign of utility systems, which could increase our operating costs, including the cost of\nelectricity and energy used by us. Our supply chain would likely be subject to these same transitional risks and would\nlikely pass along any increased costs to us.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or\nmaintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those\nproducts and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be\nable to afford expensive treatments. Sales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and\nabroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care,\npharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration\nauthorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is\navailable only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if\ncoverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain\npricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the U.S. and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare\ncosts may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as\na result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing\npressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the\nincreasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on\nhealthcare costs in general has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry\nof new products.\nBecause results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any\nproduct candidate we advance may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nMoreover, interim, âtop-line,â and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish may change,\nor the perceived product profile may be negatively impacted, as more patient data or additional endpoints (including\nefficacy and safety) are analyzed.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. The outcome of preclinical development testing and early clinical\ntrials may not be predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily\npredict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses,\nand many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and\nclinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidates. Once a product candidate\nhas displayed sufficient preclinical data to warrant clinical investigation, we will be required to demonstrate through\nadequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are effective with a favorable benefit-risk profile\n43\nfor use in populations for their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale.\nMany drug candidates fail in the early stages of clinical development for safety and tolerability issues or for insufficient\nclinical activity, despite promising pre-clinical results. Accordingly, no assurance can be made that a safe and efficacious\ndose can be found for these compounds or that they will ever enter into advanced clinical trials alone or in combination\nwith other product candidates. Moreover, success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be\nsuccessful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy\ndespite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Companies frequently experience significant setbacks in\nadvanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. There is an extremely high rate of\nfailure of pharmaceutical candidates proceeding through clinical trials.\nIndividually reported outcomes of patients treated in clinical trials may not be representative of the entire population\nof treated patients in such studies. In addition, larger scale Phase 3 studies, which are often conducted internationally, are\ninherently subject to increased operational risks compared to earlier stage studies, including the risk that the results could\nvary on a region to region or country to country basis, which could materially adversely affect the outcome of the study\nor the opinion of the validity of the study results by applicable regulatory agencies.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose top-line or preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a\npreliminary analysis of then available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change\nfollowing a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions,\nestimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of such data, and we may not have received or had the\nopportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data from the particular study or trial, including all endpoints and safety\ndata. As a result, top-line or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or\ndifferent conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully\nevaluated. Top-line or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the\nfinal data being materially different from the topline, interim, or preliminary data we previously published. When\nproviding top-line results, we may disclose the primary endpoint of a study before all secondary endpoints have been\nfully analyzed. A positive primary endpoint does not translate to all, or any, secondary endpoints being met. As a result,\ntop-line and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available, including data from the full\nsafety analysis and the final analysis of all endpoints.\nFurther, from time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim\ndata from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may\nmaterially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. For example, time-to-event\nbased endpoints such as duration of response and progression free survival have the potential to change, sometimes\ndrastically, with longer follow-up. In addition, as patients continue on therapy, there can be no assurance given that the\nfinal safety data from studies, once fully analyzed, will be consistent with prior safety data presented, will be\ndifferentiated from other similar agents in the same class, will support continued development, or will be favorable\nenough to support regulatory approvals for the indications studied. Further, others, including regulatory agencies, may\nnot accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the\nimportance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or\ncommercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. The information we\nchoose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive\ninformation, and regulators or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate\ninformation to include in our disclosure. If the interim, top-line or preliminary data that we report differ from final\nresults, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval\nfor, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating\nresults, prospects or financial condition.\n44\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval\nIf clinical trials of our lead product candidate fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, or\nthe EMA, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in\ncompleting, or ultimately be unable to complete the development and commercialization of ibezapolstat or any other\nproduct candidate.\nIn connection with obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate,\nwe must complete extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to\noutcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and\nearly clinical trials, particularly with a small number of patients, may not be predictive of the success of later clinical\ntrials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. The design of a clinical trial can\ndetermine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not\nbecome apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. We have limited experience in designing clinical\ntrials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval.\nMoreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many\ncompanies that believe their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have\nfailed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential\nmarketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent\nour ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\nâ¢ clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or\nregulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\nâ¢ the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate,\nenrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical\ntrials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\nâ¢ we may be unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to ensure adequate statistical\npower to detect any statistically significant treatment effects;\nâ¢ our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual\nobligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\nâ¢ regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our\ninvestigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\nâ¢ we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial\nprotocols with prospective trial sites;\nâ¢ we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a\nfinding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\nâ¢ regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may require that we or our\ninvestigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with\nregulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\nâ¢ clinical trials are costly and the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we\nanticipate;\nâ¢ the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our\nproduct candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\nâ¢ our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our\ninvestigators, regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate\nthe clinical trials.\n45\nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not\nknow whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be\ncompleted on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods\nduring which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring\nproducts to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may\nharm our business and results of operations.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary\nmarketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates, including our planned clinical\ntrials of ibezapolstat, if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these\nclinical trials. CDI is an acute infection that requires rapid diagnosis. For our clinical trials of ibezapolstat, we need to\nidentify potential patients, test them for CDI and enroll them in the clinical trial within a 24-hour period. In addition, our\ncompetitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates,\nand patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our\ncompetitorsâ product candidates. For our clinical trials of ibezapolstat, we need to identify potential patients and enroll\nthem in the clinical trial based on a history of diarrhea within 24 hours of a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which\nwould cause the value of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability\nto enroll a sufficient number of patients in our planned clinical trials of ibezapolstat would result in significant delays or\nmay require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, be\nunable to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research,\ntesting, development, manufacturing, quality, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage,\npackaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs. Rigorous preclinical studies and\nclinical trials, and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United\nStates and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory\nrequirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to a continuously evolving regulatory environment and\nunanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may develop will obtain the regulatory\napprovals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them.\nThe time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the\ncommencement of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. The\nstandards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when regulating companies such as ours are not always applied\npredictably or uniformly and can change. Any analysis we perform of data from chemistry, manufacturing and controls,\npreclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could\ndelay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new\ngovernment regulations, for example, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy\nduring the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether\nlegislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed,\nor what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the\nparticular product candidate for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a\nproduct may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which we may market the product or the labeling or other\nrestrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (âREMSâ) as a\ncondition of approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or safe use of an\napproved drug, such as limiting prescribing rights to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone\nspecialized training, limiting treatment to patients as specially defined by the indication statement or who meet certain\n46\nsafe-use criteria, and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry, among other requirements. These limitations and\nrestrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of\nclinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and payment. The foreign regulatory approval process\nvaries among countries and may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above, as well as risks\nattributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not ensure\napproval by comparable regulatory authorities outside of the United States and vice versa.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed drugs will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight. If we or\nour collaborators or contractors fail to comply with continuing U.S. and foreign requirements, our approvals, if\nobtained, could be limited or withdrawn, we could be subject to other penalties, and our business would be seriously\nharmed.\nFollowing any initial regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop, we will also be subject to continuing\nregulatory oversight, including the review of adverse drug experiences and safety data that are reported after our drug\nproducts are made commercially available. This would include results from any post-marketing studies or surveillance to\nmonitor the safety and efficacy of the drug product required as a condition of approval or agreed to by us. Any\nregulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved uses\nfor which the product may be marketed. Other ongoing regulatory requirements include, among other things,\nsubmissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing, as well as continued\nmaintenance of our marketing application, compliance with cGMP requirements and quality oversight, compliance with\npost-marketing commitments, and compliance with GCP for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Failure to\ncomply with these requirements could result in warning or untitled letters, criminal or civil penalties, recalls, or product\nwithdrawals. In addition, we are conducting our clinical trials and we intend to seek approval to market our product\ncandidates in jurisdictions outside of the United States, and therefore will be subject to, and must comply with,\nregulatory requirements in those jurisdictions.\nThe FDA has significant post-market authority, including, for example, the authority to require labeling changes\nbased on new safety information and to require post-market studies or clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The FDA\nalso has the authority to require a REMS plan after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on\nthe distribution or use of an approved drug.\nWe, our CMOs, and the manufacturing facilities we use to make our product candidates will also be subject to\nongoing assessment of product quality, compliance with cGMP, and periodic inspection by the FDA and potentially\nother regulatory agencies. We or our CMOs may not be able to comply with applicable cGMP regulations or similar\nregulatory requirements outside of the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our CMOs, to comply with applicable\nregulations could result in regulatory actions, such as the issuance of FDA Form 483 notices of observations, warning\nletters or sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or\nwithdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and\ncriminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. We may not have\nthe ability or capacity to manufacture material at a broader commercial scale in the future. We and our CMOs currently\nmanufacture a limited supply of clinical trial materials. Reliance on CMOs entails risks to which we would not be\nsubject if we manufactured all of our material ourselves, including reliance on the CMO for regulatory compliance. Our\nproduct promotion and advertising will also be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review.\nIf we or our collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory\nrequirements in the United States or foreign jurisdictions in which we may seek to market our products, we or they may\nbe subject to, among other things, fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, refusal by the FDA or comparable\nforeign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, suspension or\nwithdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, refusal to permit the import or export of products,\noperating restrictions, injunction, consent decree, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nOur product candidates for which we obtain approval may face competition sooner than anticipated.\n47\nEven if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate ahead of our\ncompetitors, our future pharmaceutical products may face direct competition from generic and other follow-on drug\nproducts. Any of our product candidates that may achieve regulatory approval in the future may face competition from\ngeneric products earlier or more aggressively than anticipated, depending upon how well such approved products\nperform in the U.S. prescription drug market. Our ability to compete may also be affected in many cases by insurers or\nother third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as\ndrugs previously approved for marketing under the NDA provisions of the statute pursuant to ANDAs, and also created\nthe Section 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. An ANDA relies on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a previously\napproved reference listed drug and must demonstrate to the FDA that the generic drug product is identical to the RLD\nwith respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug and also\nthat it is âbioequivalentâ to the reference listed drug. In contrast, Section 505(b)(2) enables the applicant to rely, in part,\non the FDAâs prior findings of safety and efficacy data for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its\napplication. Section 505(b)(2) provides an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses\nof previously approved products; for example, a follow-on applicant may be seeking approval to market a previously\napproved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate\nsafety or effectiveness. Such products, if approved and depending upon the scope of the changes made to the reference\ndrug, may also compete with any product candidates for which we receive approval.\nThe FDA is prohibited by statute from approving an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA when certain marketing or data\nexclusivity protections apply to the reference listed drug. However, if any competitor or third party is able to\ndemonstrate bioequivalence without infringing our patents, then such competitor or third party may then be able to gain\napproval of an ANDA and introduce a competing generic product onto the market.\nFurthermore, the CREATES Act established a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to\nsue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish necessary samples of an RLD on âcommercially reasonable, market-\nbased terms.â If generic developers request samples of any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval\nin order to conduct comparative testing to support one or more ANDAs for a generic version of our products, and we\nrefuse any such request, we may be subject to litigation under the CREATES Act. Although lawsuits have been filed\nunder the CREATES Act since its enactment, those lawsuits have settled privately; therefore, to date, no federal court\nhas reviewed or opined on the statutory language and there continues to be uncertainty regarding the scope and\napplication of the law.\nWe cannot predict the interest of potential follow-on competitors or how quickly others may seek to come to market\nwith competing products, whether approved as a direct ANDA competitor or as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA referencing\none of our future product candidates. If the FDA approves generic versions of any of our products in the future, should\nthey be approved for commercial marketing, such competitive products may be able to immediately compete with us in\neach indication for which our product has received approval, which could negatively impact our future revenue,\nprofitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on our investments.\nRisks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our product development should\nwe elect to extend development outside the U.S.\nShould we elect to extend development outside the U.S., we may be subject to risks related to operating in foreign\ncountries. Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:\nâ¢ differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;\nmore stringent privacy requirements for data to be supplied to our operations in the United States, e.g., GDPR\nin the EU;\nâ¢ unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including\ninflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; compliance with tax, employment,\nimmigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; foreign taxes, including withholding of\npayroll taxes;\n48\nâ¢ differing payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price controls;\nâ¢ foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and\nother obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;\nâ¢ workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\nâ¢ continued uncertainties related to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU (known as âBrexitâ) and its financial,\ntrade, regulatory and legal implications, which could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national\nlaws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate, and which may further create\nglobal economic uncertainty, which could materially adversely affect our business, business opportunities,\nresults of operations, financial condition, and cash flows;\nâ¢ production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities\nabroad, including those that may result from the recent coronavirus outbreak; and\nâ¢ business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and\nregulatory actions.\nLegislative and regulatory actions affecting government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement\nprograms occur relatively frequently. In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the âACAâ) was\nenacted in 2010 to expand healthcare coverage. Since then, numerous efforts have been made to repeal, amend or\nadministratively limit the ACA in whole or in part. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other\nthings, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate\nProgram are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum\nMedicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to\nindividuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of certain\nbranded prescription drugs, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. We expect that future\nchanges or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and changes stemming from other healthcare\nreform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could\nhave a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry in the United States. Complying with any new legislation or\nreversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse\neffect on our business. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new\nrequirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval\nthat we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, on December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 was signed into law\n(P.L. 116-94) and includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent\nSamples Act of 2019 (the âCREATES Actâ). The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the\nFDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their\nproducts, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic product developers access\nto samples of brand products. Because generic product developers need samples of a reference listed drug, to conduct\ncertain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause\nof delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of\naction that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary\nsamples on âcommercially reasonable, market-based terms.â Whether and how generic product developments will use\nthis new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain\nhighly uncertain and its potential effects on any of our future commercial products are unknown.\nFor a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold\ndirectly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the\n340B Drug Pricing Program. The maximum amount that a manufacturer may charge a 340B covered entity for a given\nproduct is the average manufacturer price (âAMPâ), reduced by the rebate amount paid by the manufacturer to Medicaid\nfor each unit of that product. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B\npricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of childrenâs hospitals, these newly eligible\nentities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is\n49\ndetermined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition\ndescribed above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.\nMoreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for\ntheir marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and\nstate legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship\nbetween pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for\ndrug products. For example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020\nincorporated extensive healthcare provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all\nmanufacturers of drug products covered under Medicare Part B report the productâs average sales price to CMS\nbeginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties. The U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services (âDHHSâ) has also solicited feedback on various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the\nout-of-pocket costs of drugs and has implemented others under its existing authority.\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed into the law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the âIRAâ). The IRA has\nmultiple provisions that may impact the prices of drug products that are both sold into the Medicare program and\nthroughout the United States. Starting in 2023, a manufacturer of a drug or biological product covered by Medicare Parts\nB or D must pay a rebate to the federal government if the drug productâs price increases faster than the rate of inflation.\nThis calculation is made on a drug product by drug product basis and the amount of the rebate owed to the federal\ngovernment is directly dependent on the volume of a drug product that is paid for by Medicare Parts B or D.\nAdditionally, starting in payment year 2026, CMS will negotiate drug prices annually for a select number of single\nsource Part D drugs without generic or biosimilar competition. CMS will also negotiate drug prices for a select number\nof Part B drugs starting for payment year 2028. If a drug product is selected by CMS for negotiation, it is expected that\nthe revenue generated from such drug will decrease. CMS has begun to implement these new authorities and entered into\nthe first set of agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers to conduct price negotiations in October 2023. However,\nthe IRAâs impact on the pharmaceutical industry in the United States remains uncertain, in part because multiple large\npharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders (e.g., the U.S. Chamber of Commerce) have initiated federal lawsuits\nagainst CMS arguing the program is unconstitutional for a variety of reasons, among other complaints. Those lawsuits\nare currently ongoing.\nIn addition, many states have proposed or enacted legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate\npharmaceutical drug pricing, such as by requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing\ninformation or to place a maximum price ceiling on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. For example,\nin recent years, several states have formed prescription drug affordability boards (âPDABsâ). Much like the IRAâs drug\nprice negotiation program, these PDABs have attempted to implement upper payment limits (âUPLsâ) on drugs sold in\ntheir respective states in both public and commercial health plans. In August 2023, Coloradoâs PDAB announced a list\nof five prescription drugs that would undergo an affordability review. The effects of these efforts remain uncertain\npending the outcomes of several federal lawsuits challenging state authority to regulate prescription drug payment limits.\nIn December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the statesâ ability to\nregulate pharmaceutical benefit managers (âPBMsâ) and other members of the healthcare and pharmaceutical supply\nchain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area. The Federal\nTrade Commission (âFTCâ) in mid-2022 also launched sweeping investigations into the practices of the PBM industry\nthat could lead to additional federal and state legislative or regulatory proposals targeting such entitiesâ operations,\npharmacy networks, or financial arrangements. Significant efforts to change the PBM industry as it currently exists in\nthe U.S. may affect the entire pharmaceutical supply chain and the business of other stakeholders, including\npharmaceutical product developers like us.\nChanges to the Medicaid program at the federal or state level could also have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness. Proposals that could impact coverage and reimbursement of our products, including giving states more\nflexibility to manage drugs covered under the Medicaid program and permitting the re-importation of prescription\nmedications from Canada or other countries, could have a material adverse effect by limiting our productsâ use and\ncoverage. Furthermore, state Medicaid programs could request additional supplemental rebates on our products as a\nresult of an increase in the federal base Medicaid rebate. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs\nfollow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, they could use the enactment of these increased rebates to exert\n50\npricing pressure on our products, and the adverse effects may be magnified by their adoption of lower payment\nschedules.\nOther proposed regulatory actions affecting manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is\ndifficult to predict the impact, if any, of any such proposed legislative and regulatory actions or resulting state actions on\nthe use and reimbursement of our products in the U.S., but our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market\nand sell our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing ibezapolstat or any other product\ncandidate if and when such product candidates are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale or marketing of\npharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and\nmarketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. If ibezapolstat receives marketing approval, we\nintend to commercialize it in the U.S. with our own focused, specialized sales force. We plan to evaluate the potential for\nutilizing additional collaboration, distribution and marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize\nibezapolstat in other jurisdictions where we retain commercialization rights. There are risks involved with establishing\nour own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For\nexample, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If\nthe commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is\ndelayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization\nexpenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing\npersonnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\nâ¢ our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\nâ¢ the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any\nfuture products;\nâ¢ the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive\ndisadvantage relative to competitors with more extensive product lines; and\nâ¢ unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales and marketing services, our product revenues or the\nprofitability of these product revenues will likely be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we\ndevelop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and\nmarket our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us. We likely will have little\ncontrol over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and\nmarket our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or\nin collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and our ongoing\nclinical trials, and expect to continue to do so for additional clinical trials and ultimately for commercialization. This\nreliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or\ndrugs or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or\ncommercialization efforts.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture supplies of our product candidates\nfor use in development and commercialization. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for\nthe production of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials under the guidance of members of our\norganization. We do not have long-term supply agreements. Furthermore, the raw materials for our product candidates\nare sourced, in some cases, from a single-source supplier although other sources are available. For example, drug\n51\nsubstance and drug product are sourced from our principal supplier, Piramal Pharma Solutions, in Ennore, India and\nAhmedabad, India, respectively. Chemical raw materials used for drug substance manufacture are sourced locally in\nIndia and are generally available. Accordingly, we do not anticipate difficulties sourcing drug substance for our clinical\ntrials or, if FDA approved, for our marketing period, but we have not yet sourced a backup supplier because we currently\nhave sufficient supply to complete our Phase 2b clinical trial. We are considering U.S. sources of drug substance for the\ncommercial period if ibezapolstat is FDA approved and we anticipate several manufacturing options will be available. If\nwe were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of any of our product candidates or any of our future product\ncandidates for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could\nexperience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing\nclinical trials.\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product\ncandidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to maintain or establish required agreements\nwith third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-\nparty manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\nâ¢ the failure of the third party to manufacture our product candidates according to our schedule, or at all,\nincluding if our third-party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product\ncandidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements between us and\nthem;\nâ¢ the reduction or termination of production or deliveries by suppliers, or the raising of prices or renegotiation of\nterms;\nâ¢ the termination or nonrenewal of arrangements or agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is\ncostly or inconvenient for us;\nâ¢ the breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them;\nâ¢ the failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;\nâ¢ the failure of the third party to manufacture our product candidates according to our specifications;\nâ¢ the mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active\ndrug or placebo not being properly identified;\nâ¢ clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug\nsupplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and\nâ¢ the misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nWe do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our\ncontract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacturing both active drug substances\nand finished drug products. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar\nregulatory requirements outside of the U.S. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that\nconforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA or others, they will not be able to\nsecure and/or maintain marketing approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we do not have control over the\nability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If\nthe FDA, EMA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our\nproduct candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing\nfacilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or market our product\ncandidates, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable\nregulations could subject us and our third-party manufacturers to warning letters or other enforcement-related letters,\nholds on clinical trials or could result in further sanctions being imposed on us or our third-party manufacturers,\nincluding fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures\nor recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could\nsignificantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates or drugs and harm our business and results of\noperations. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or\ndrugs may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any product candidates that\nreceive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\n52\nWe rely on third party clinical investigators, contract research organizations (âCROsâ), clinical data management\norganizations and consultants to design, conduct, supervise and monitor preclinical studies and clinical trials of our\nproduct candidates. Because we rely on third parties and do not have the ability to conduct preclinical studies or clinical\ntrials independently, we have less control over the timing, quality and other aspects of preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials than we would if we conducted them on our own. These investigators, CROs and consultants are not our\nemployees and we have limited control over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. These\nthird parties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may\ndraw time and resources from our programs. Further, these third parties may not be diligent, careful or timely in\nconducting our preclinical studies or clinical trials, resulting in the preclinical studies or clinical trials being delayed or\nunsuccessful.\nIf we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third\nparties do not carry out their contractual duties, satisfy legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical\nstudies or clinical trials or meet expected deadlines, our preclinical and clinical development programs could be delayed\nand otherwise adversely affected. In all events, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and\nclinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. The FDA and\nother health authorities require preclinical studies to be conducted in accordance with GLP and clinical trials to be\nconducted in accordance with GCP, including conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure\nthat data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial\nparticipants are protected. If we or our CROs fail to comply with these requirements, the data generated in our clinical\ntrials may be deemed unreliable or uninterpretable and the FDA may require us to perform additional preclinical studies\nor clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and\nrequirements. Any such event could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nIf ultimate users of our product candidates are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, or\nif new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our proposed products may be limited and we may not\nachieve material revenues.\nThe continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers\nof healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the\nfuture revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of\ncapital. For example, in the U.S., given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost\nof healthcare, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of\nprescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether\nany such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of such proposals and related\nlaws, rules and regulations could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nMoreover, the passage of the ACA in 2010, and efforts to amend or repeal such law, has created significant uncertainty\nrelating to the scope of government regulation of healthcare and related legal and regulatory requirements, which could\nhave an adverse impact on sales of our products.\nMoreover, our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which\nappropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of such products and related treatments are obtained by governmental\nauthorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Consumers and third-party payers are\nincreasingly challenging the prices charged for medical drugs and services. Also, the trend toward managed healthcare in\nthe U.S. and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the\npurchase of healthcare services and drugs, as well as legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce government\ninsurance programs, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our proposed products.\n53\nOur relationships with future customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and\nabuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties,\ncontractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and\nprescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-\nparty payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and\nregulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market,\nsell and distribute our products. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and may not control referrals of\nhealthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws\nand regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patientsâ rights are and will be applicable to our business. These\nregulations include:\nâ¢ the Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and\nwillfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to\ninduce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or\nrecommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program\nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid, and which will constrain our marketing practices and the marketing practices\nof our licensees, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other\nentities;\nâ¢ the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians\nfrom referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of âdesignated health servicesâ with whom the\nphysician or a member of the physicianâs immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation\narrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies;\nâ¢ federal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or\ncausing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement\nprograms that are false or fraudulent, and which may expose entities that provide coding and billing advice to\ncustomers to potential criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and\nincluding as a result of claims presented in violation of the Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark\nLaw or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA;\nâ¢ the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (âHIPAAâ), which imposes criminal\nand civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal\ncriminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or\nmaking any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits,\nitems or services that, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health\nAct, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy,\nsecurity and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\nâ¢ federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA, which requires manufacturers of approved drugs,\ndevices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the HHS, information related to payments and\nother transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and\ninvestment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and\napplicable group purchasing organizations;\nâ¢ the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which, among other things, strictly regulates drug product\nmarketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the\ndistribution of drug samples; and\nâ¢ state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws,\nwhich may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services\nreimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws requiring\npharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industryâs voluntary compliance guidelines and\nthe relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and which may require drug\nmanufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other\nhealthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security\nof health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and\noften are not preempted by federal laws such as HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\n54\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and\nregulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business\npractices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or\nother healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other\ngovernmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative\npenalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and\nMedicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or\nentities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject\nto criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we or our collaborators may be\nrequired to file infringement lawsuits that can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement\nproceeding, a court may decide that one of our patents is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed, or may\nrefuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the\ntechnology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at\nrisk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put any pending applications at risk of being interpreted\nnarrowly and not issuing.\nInterference proceedings or derivation proceedings may be filed to determine the priority of inventions with respect\nto our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors (if any). An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease\nusing the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the\nprevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. We may not be able to prevent, alone or\nwith our licensors (if any), misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and in countries where\nthe laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S. Other proceedings, such as proceedings before the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board, filed by a third party may result in the invalidation of one\nor more of our patents.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property\nlitigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type\nof litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings\nor developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse\neffect on the price of our common stock.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their\nnormal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, regardless\nof their merit, would cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel\nfrom their normal responsibilities. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay\nsubstantial damages, including treble damages and attorneysâ fees for willful infringement, in addition to paying\nroyalties, redesign infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or\nrequire substantial time and monetary expenditure. A court may also issue an injunction against us preventing us from\nmanufacturing and bringing our products to market. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of\nhearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these\nresults to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or\nproceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development\nactivities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources\nto conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such\nlitigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties\n55\nresulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to\ncompete in the marketplace.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may\nnot be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that is important or necessary to the\ndevelopment or commercialization of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary\ntechnology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from\nthese third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. Such\nlicenses may not be available which could prevent us from commercializing our products. Further, if we are alleged to\ninfringe third party intellectual property rights, we could face costly litigation, the outcome of which could negatively\naffect or prevent us from commercializing or developing our products. In the event of an adverse decision against us in a\nlitigation, we could be required to: pay substantial damages and license fees, or even be prevented from using or\ncommercializing our technologies and methods; and also be prevented from further research and development efforts. In\nsuch case, we may be unable to develop alternative non-infringing products or methods and unable to obtain one or more\nlicenses from third parties.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our rights to intellectual property or secure rights to third-party\npatents, we may lose valuable rights, experience reduced market share, assuming any, or incur costly litigation to\nenforce, maintain or protect such rights.\nOur ability to license, obtain, enforce and maintain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without\ninfringing the proprietary rights of others is important to the commercialization of any formulations or products under\ndevelopment. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including ours, are frequently\nuncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can\nbe significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, our patents, patent applications and other intellectual\nproperty rights may not provide protection against competitive technologies or products or may be held invalid if\nchallenged or could be circumvented. Our competitors may also independently develop products similar to ours or\ndesign around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to, or licensed by, us. In addition, the laws of some foreign\ncountries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. law. Any of these occurrences would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause\nus to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal\nresponsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim\nproceedings or developments. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce\nthe resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial\nor other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain\nthe costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources.\nAccordingly, costs and lost management time, as well as uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of\npatent litigation or other proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be\nharmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we will also rely on trade secrets, including\nunpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary and confidential information, to maintain our competitive\nposition. We will seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality\nagreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific\ncollaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that\nwe will have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the\nagreements we do execute will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement\ncould breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary or confidential information, including our trade secrets, and we\n56\nmay not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or\nmisappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition,\nsome courts inside and outside the U.S. are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets\nwere to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or\nthose to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade\nsecrets, particularly unpatented know-how, were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our\ncompetitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital\nappreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain earnings, if\nany, to finance the growth and development of our business and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the\nforeseeable future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our members.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company,\nwhich may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace\nor remove our current management.\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our\nmanagement. The existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and\nlimit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Furthermore, we have\nthe authority to issue shares of our preferred stock without further stockholder approval, the rights of which will be\ndetermined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a âpoison pillâ to dilute the\nstock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our board of directors does not approve. In\naddition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company\nmore difficult, including the following:\nâ¢ our authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or\ndiscourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise;\nâ¢ our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors\nare only able to be removed from office for cause;\nâ¢ our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and will not be able to take action\nby written consent for any matter, except in certain circumstances;\nâ¢ a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors or a\nmajority of our board of directors;\nâ¢ advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders; and\nâ¢ certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and any amendments to our bylaws by our stockholders\nwill require the approval of at least two-thirds of our then-outstanding voting power entitled to vote generally in\nan election of directors, voting together as a single class.\n57\nWe are an âemerging growth company,â and a âsmaller reporting companyâ and we cannot be certain if the reduced\nreporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our\ncommon stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an âemerging growth company,â as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging\ngrowth company, we intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to\nother public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including:\nâ¢ being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited\ninterim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operationsâ disclosure in this Form 10-K;\nâ¢ not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct;\nâ¢ reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\nand\nâ¢ exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive\ncompensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.\nIf some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our\ncommon stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the\nfifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at\nleast $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to\nbe a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds\n$700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-\nconvertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until\nsuch time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the extended transition period\nfor adopting new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act as an emerging growth company. As a result of\nthis election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective\ndates.\nWe are also a smaller reporting company, and we will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year\nfollowing the determination that our voting and non-voting shares of common stock held by non-affiliates is more than\n$250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenues are less than\n$100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting shares of common stock held\nby non-affiliates is more than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.\nSimilar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations, such as an\nexemption from providing selected financial data and an ability to provide simplified executive compensation\ninformation and only two years of audited financial statements.\nThe price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk\nfactors listed in this section and many others beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this âRisk\nFactorsâ section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, these factors include:\nâ¢ the commencement, enrollment, completion or results of our current Phase 2b clinical trial of ibezapolstat;\n58\nâ¢ any delay in our regulatory filings for ibezapolstat or our future product candidates and any adverse\ndevelopment or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authorityâs review of\nsuch filings, including without limitation the FDAâs issuance of a ârefusal to fileâ letter or a request for\nadditional information;\nâ¢ adverse results or delays, suspensions or terminations in future preclinical studies or clinical trials;\nâ¢ our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\nâ¢ adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of ibezapolstat or any other\nproduct candidate or the failure of a regulatory authority to accept data from preclinical studies or clinical trials\nconducted in other countries;\nâ¢ changes in laws or regulations applicable to ibezapolstat or any other product candidate, including but not\nlimited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\nâ¢ adverse developments concerning our manufacturers;\nâ¢ our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable\nprices;\nâ¢ our inability to establish collaborations, if needed;\nâ¢ our failure to commercialize our product candidates, if approved;\nâ¢ additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\nâ¢ unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of ibezapolstat or any other product candidate;\nâ¢ introduction of new products or services offered by us or our competitors;\nâ¢ announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us\nor our competitors;\nâ¢ our ability to effectively manage our growth;\nâ¢ actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\nâ¢ our cash position;\nâ¢ our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide\nto the public;\nâ¢ publication of research reports about us or our industry, or product candidates in particular, or positive or\nnegative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\nâ¢ changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\nâ¢ changes in the structure of the healthcare payment systems;\nâ¢ overall performance of the equity markets;\nâ¢ sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\nâ¢ trading volume of our common stock;\nâ¢ changes in accounting practices;\nâ¢ ineffectiveness of our internal controls;\nâ¢ disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability\nto obtain patent protection for our technologies;\nâ¢ significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\nâ¢ general political and economic conditions, many of which are beyond our control, such as military conflicts\nbetween Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Hamas, and\nâ¢ other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical,\nbiotechnology and other life sciences company stocks. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life\nsciences company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. If\nour quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common\nstock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the\nprice of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not\nnecessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\n59\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility\nin their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managementâs attention and\nresources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nOur largest stockholders will exercise significant influence over our company for the foreseeable future, including\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur officers, directors and their affiliates currently collectively own 4,577,599 shares of our common stock (on an\nas-converted basis) or approximately 27% of our outstanding shares of common stock (on an as-converted basis) as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Accordingly, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they could have a significant\ninfluence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant\ncorporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or all or a significant percentage of our assets. This\nconcentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or\npreventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nWe cannot assure you that the interests of our officers, directors and affiliated persons will coincide with the\ninterests of the investors. So long as our officers, directors and affiliated persons collectively controls a significant\nportion of our common stock, these individuals and/or entities controlled by them, will continue to collectively be able to\nstrongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to\nhave any control over our company.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investorsâ ability to make\ntransactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nShould we fail to satisfy the Nasdaqâs continued listing requirements, such as the corporate governance\nrequirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a\ndelisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, and would impair your ability to sell or\npurchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our\ncompliance with Nasdaqâs listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would\nallow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock,\nprevent our common stock from dropping below Nasdaqâs minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-\ncompliance with the Nasdaqâs listing requirements.\nIf Nasdaq does not maintain the listing of our securities for trading on its exchange, we could face significant\nmaterial adverse consequences, including:\nâ¢ a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\nâ¢ reduced liquidity for our common stock;\nâ¢ a determination that our common stock is a âpenny stockâ which will require brokers trading in our common\nstock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary\ntrading market for our securities;\nâ¢ a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\nâ¢ a decreased ability to issue additional common stock or obtain additional financing in the future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert managementâs attention and affect our\nability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations.\nCompliance with these rules and regulations has increased, and will likely continue to increase our legal and financial\ncompliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and place significant strain on our\npersonnel, systems and resources. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance\n60\nand public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and\nmaking some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve\nover time. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters, higher administrative expenses and\na diversion of managementâs time and attention. Further, if our compliance efforts differ from the activities intended by\nregulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal\nproceedings against us and our business may be harmed. Being a public company that is subject to these rules and\nregulations also make it more expensive for us to obtain and retain director and officer liability insurance and we may in\nthe future be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain or retain adequate\ncoverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of\ndirectors and qualified executive officers.\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption\nand/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and\nservices, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security\nbreaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to\ncorruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early-stage\ncompany without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such\noccurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any\nvulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have\nadverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material and could exceed the limits of the\ncybersecurity insurance we maintain, if any, against such risks. If the information technology systems of our third-party\nvendors and other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have\ninsufficient recourse against such third parties and may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of\nsuch an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.\nWe cannot assure you that our data protection efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in\nour systems, or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or other cyber incidents that could\nhave a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations, or financial condition. For example, if such an\nevent were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors\nand consultants, it could result in a material disruption of our programs and the development of our services and\ntechnologies could be delayed. Furthermore, significant disruptions of our internal information technology systems or\nthose of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or security breaches could result in the loss,\nmisappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential\ninformation (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal\ninformation), which could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For instance, any such event\nthat leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding\nour customers or employees, could harm our reputation directly, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach\nnotification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to\nliability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in\nsignificant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nAlthough we take measures to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, our information\ntechnology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to personnel error,\nmalfeasance, or other malicious or inadvertent disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our\nnetworks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, manipulated, publicly disclosed,\nlost, or stolen.\n61\nAny such access, breach, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under\ndomestic or foreign privacy, data protection and data security laws such as HIPAA and the Health Information\nTechnology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (âHITECHâ), and penalties. Notice of certain security breaches must\nbe made to affected individuals, the Secretary of HHS, and for extensive breaches, notice may need to be made to the\nmedia or state attorneys general. Such notice could harm our reputation and our ability to compete. Although we have\nimplemented security measures, such data is currently accessible through multiple channels, and there is no guarantee\nwe can protect our data from breach. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also damage our reputation or\ndisrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses, conduct research and development activities,\ncollect, process and prepare company financial information, and manage the administrative aspects of our business.\nPenalties for violations of these laws vary. For instance, penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of\nHIPAA and HITECH vary significantly, and include significant civil monetary penalties and, in certain circumstances,\ncriminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. A person who knowingly obtains or\ndiscloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to\n$50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false\npretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or\nmalicious harm.\nFurther, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy laws and\nregulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements\nregulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. These laws and\nregulations are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state afford greater protection to individuals than\nHIPAA. Where state laws are more protective, we have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and\npenalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe\ntheir personal information has been misused. Californiaâs patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up\nto $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. Similarly, the CCPA allows consumers a private right of\naction when certain personal information is subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft or disclosure due to a\nbusinessâ failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures. The interplay of federal and state laws may\nbe subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and\ndata we receive, use and share, potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as\nregulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal\ninformation expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or\nregulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, for the treatment of genetic data,\nalong with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of\nproviding our products, decrease demand for our products, reduce our revenues and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\nWe may fail to comply with evolving privacy and data protection laws, which could adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nIn California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ), which became effective in 2020, broadly defines\npersonal information, gives California residents expanded individual privacy rights and protections and provides for civil\npenalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the\nâCPRAâ), which became effective in 2023 and amends the CCPA, creates additional obligations with respect to\nprocessing and storing personal information. We will continue to monitor developments related to the CCPA and\nanticipate additional costs and expenses associated with CPRA compliance. While there is an exception for protected\nhealth information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, the CCPA may impact our business activities if\nwe become a âBusinessâ regulated by the CCPA. Unlike other state privacy laws, the CCPA also regulates personal\ninformation collected in a business to business and in human resources contexts. Further, there continues to be some\nuncertainly about how certain provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and how the law will be enforced.\nIn addition to the CCPA, broad consumer privacy laws recently went into effect in Virginia on January 1, 2023, in\nColorado and Connecticut on July 1, 2023, and in Utah on December 31, 2023. New privacy laws will also become\neffective in Florida, Montana and Texas in 2024, in Tennessee and Iowa in 2025, and in Indiana in 2026 and numerous\n62\nother states are considering new privacy laws. Furthermore, other U.S. states, such as New York, Massachusetts, and\nUtah have enacted stringent data security laws and numerous other states have proposed similar privacy laws.\nNew privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the states in the U.S. and in the U.S.\nCongress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which trend may accelerate with\nincreasing concerns about individual privacy. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the\ncountry will make our compliance obligations more complex and costly and may require us to modify our data\nprocessing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such\nlegislation.\nIn the EU and the U.K., we may also face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks in connection\nwith requirements of EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ), the GDPR as it existed on December 31,\n2020 but subject to certain U.K. specific amendments incorporated into U.K. law on January 1, 2021 under the U.K.\nGDPR and other data protection requirements. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU as well as to\nthose outside the EU if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to\nindividuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. We currently conduct clinical trials and engage in regulatory\nand commercial operations in the European Economic Area (the âEEAâ), and the U.K. As a result, we are subject to\nadditional privacy laws, including the GDPR and U.K. GDPR, collectively referred to as GDPR. The GDPR imposes a\nbroad range of data protection obligations on companies subject to the GDPR, including, for example, imposing\nobligations on companies around how they process personal data, stricter requirements relating to processing health and\nother sensitive data, ensuring there is a legal basis to justify the processing of personal data, stricter requirements relating\nto obtaining consent of individuals, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on\nretention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements, implementing safeguards to protect the\nsecurity and confidentiality of personal data, taking certain measures on engagement with third parties, restrictions on\ntransfers outside of the EU to third countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections (such as the U.S.), and has\ncreated onerous new obligations and liabilities on services providers or data processors. Non-compliance with the\nGDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to â¬20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.\nMoreover, data subjects can claim damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. The GDPR further grants non-\nprofit organizations the right to bring claims on behalf of data subjects. The GDPR and other changes in laws or\nregulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other\nsensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from\noffering certain services in jurisdictions that we may operate in. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability\nin relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put\nin place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries.\nCompliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or\nrequire us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and\npenalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities.\nIn addition, further to the U.K.âs exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the U.K. at the\nend of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the U.K.âs European Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the U.K. GDPR into U.K. law. The U.K. GDPR and the U.K. Data Protection Act\n2018 set out the U.K.âs data protection regime, which is independent from but, currently, aligned to the EUâs data\nprotection regime. Non-compliance with the U.K. GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to Â£17.5 million or 4%\nof worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. In addition, on June 28, 2021, the EC adopted an adequacy decision in\nrespect of transfers of personal data to the U.K. for a four-year period (until June 27, 2025). Similarly, the U.K. has\ndetermined that it considers all of the EEA to be adequate for the purposes of data protection. This ensures that data\nflows between the U.K. and the EEA remain unaffected. The U.K. Government has also now introduced a Data\nProtection and Digital Information Bill (or the UK Bill) into the UK legislative process with the intention for this bill to\nreform the U.K.âs data protection regime following Brexit. If passed, the final version of the U.K. Bill may have the\neffect of further altering the similarities between the U.K. and EU data protection regime and threaten the U.K.\nAdequacy Decision from the EU Commission. This may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our\noverall risk.\n63\nOver the past few years, the number of enforcement actions and the fines have both steadily increased. U.S. data\nprivacy laws, such as the CCPA, and others that may be passed, similarly introduce requirements with respect to\npersonal information, and non-compliance with the CCPA may result in liability through private actions (subject to\ndefined statutory damages in the event of certain data breaches) and enforcement. Failure to comply with these current\nand future laws, policies, industry standards, or legal obligations or any security incident resulting in the unauthorized\naccess to, corruption of, or acquisition, release, or transfer of personal information may result in government\nenforcement actions, litigation, fines, and penalties, or adverse publicity and could cause our customers, business\npartners, and investors to lose trust in us which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of our\noperations. We continue to face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on our trials and we\nmay be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of\nthe new law.\nIn particular, member states of the EEA, or the Member States, have implemented national laws which may partially\ndeviate from the GDPR and impose different and more restrictive obligations from country to country, so that we do not\nexpect to operate in a uniform legal landscape in the EU. Also, as it relates to processing and transfer of genetic data,\nthe GDPR specifically allows the Member States to enact laws that impose additional and more specific requirements or\nrestrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional\nuncertainty.\nIn addition, we must also ensure that we maintain adequate safeguards to enable the transfer of personal data outside\nof the EEA or the U.K., in particular to the U.S., in compliance with EEA and U.K. data protection laws. We expect that\nwe will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy\nlaws will be sufficient. In some cases, we rely upon the recently updated standard contractual clauses (new standard\ncontractual clauses) to legitimize transfers of personal data out of the EEA from controllers or processors established\noutside the EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). Transition to the new standard contractual clauses requires significant\neffort and cost particularly given the burdensome requirements of transfer impact assessments and the substantial\nobligations that the new standard contractual clauses impose upon exporters. The U.K. is not subject to the EC's new\nstandard contractual clauses but has published its own transfer mechanism, the International Data Transfer Agreement,\nwhich enables transfers from the U.K. On June 28, 2021, the EC announced a decision of âadequacyâ concluding that\nthe U.K. ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of\ncontinued personal data flows from the EEA to the U.K. Some uncertainty remains, however, as this adequacy\ndetermination must be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim. The U.K. Government\nhas confirmed that transfers from the U.K. to the EEA may currently continue to flow freely. Changes with respect to\nany of these matters may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. The EU and U.S. have adopted\nits adequacy decision for the EU U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the âFramework\"), which enters into force on July 11,\n2023. This Framework provides that the protection of personal data transferred between the EU and the U.S. is\ncomparable to that offered in the EU. This provides a further avenue to ensuring transfers to the US are carried out in\nline with GDPR. The Framework could be challenged like its predecessor frameworks.\nIf we are investigated by a European data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such\ninvestigation or charges by European data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business\nand on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy,\nreluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products\ndue to the potential risk exposure because of the current (and future) data protection obligations imposed on them by\ncertain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical\npartners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally\nuncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could\nmaterially harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions outside of Europe are also considering and/or enacting comprehensive data\nprotection legislation. For example, as of August 2020, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law imposes stringent\nrequirements similar to GDPR with respect to personal information collected from individuals in Brazil.\n64\nIn China, there have also been recent significant developments concerning privacy and data security. The Data\nSecurity Law of the Peopleâs Republic of China (âData Security Lawâ), which took effect on September 1, 2021,\nrequires data processing (which includes the collection, storage, use, processing, transmission, provision and publication\nof data), to be conducted in a legitimate and proper manner. The Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy\nobligations on entities and individuals carrying out data processing activities and also introduces a data classification and\nhierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development and the degree of\nharm it may cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations\nif such data are tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or illegally used. The appropriate level of protection\nmeasures is required to be taken for each respective category of data.\nAlso in China, the Personal Information Protection Law, which took effect on November 1, 2021, introduced\nstringent protection requirements for processing personal information, which are in many ways akin to the requirements\nof the GDPR. We may be required to make further significant adjustments to our business practices to comply with the\npersonal information protection laws and regulations in China including the Personal Information Protection Law.\nWe also continue to see jurisdictions imposing data localization laws. These regulations may interfere with our\nintended business activities, inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer\nservices in those markets without significant additional costs.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws (including the GDPR),\ncommercial frameworks, and standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, frameworks, and standards may be\ninterpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices and policies. If so,\nin addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, breach of contract claims, and other claims and penalties, we could be\nrequired to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solutions, which could have an\nadverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or\ncomply with applicable privacy and security or data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional\ncost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit our ability to conduct trials, and adversely affect our business.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with potential future financings, acquisitions, investments, our\nstock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We\nexpect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our stock incentive plans. We may also raise\ncapital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in\ncomplementary companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or\ninvestment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of\ntheir ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other\nimproper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and\ncollaborators. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA\nand non-U.S. regulators, to provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, to comply with healthcare\nfraud and abuse laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, to report financial information or data accurately or to\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry\nare subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other\nabusive practices.\nThese laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion,\nsales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve\nthe improper use of information obtained during clinical studies that could result in regulatory sanctions and cause\nserious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions\nwe take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or\n65\nin protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with\nthese laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or\nasserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant\nfines or other sanctions.\nThere may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent\nerror or fraud may materially harm us.\nProper systems of internal control over financial accounting and disclosure are critical to the operation of a public\ncompany. We may be unable to effectively establish such systems, especially in light of the fact that we expect to\noperate as a publicly reporting company. This would leave us without the ability to reliably assimilate and compile\nfinancial information about us and significantly impair our ability to prevent error and detect fraud, all of which would\nhave a negative impact on us from many perspectives.\nMoreover, we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, even if established,\nwill prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systemâs objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control\nsystem must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to\ntheir costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to\nprevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us.\nThe estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial statements\ncould prove inaccurate.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial\nstatements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances. We cannot assure, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change\nover time or otherwise prove inaccurate. Any potential litigation related to the estimates and judgments we make, or the\nassumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial statements could have a material adverse effect on our financial\nresults, harm our business, and cause our share price to decline.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other\nadverse consequences.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally\nprohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of\nobtaining or retaining business. Some foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, may not be subject\nto these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-\nto-time in countries in which we conduct our business. However, our employees or other agents may engage in conduct\nfor which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices,\nwe could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may\nresult in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes\nto our business operation are required. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion\nof our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer\nperception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a\nresult, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n66\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or\npenalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing\nlaboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From\ntime to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including\nchemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third\nparties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination\nor injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our\nhazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We\nalso could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such\nlaws and regulations.\nWe maintain workersâ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to\nour employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage\nagainst potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that\nmay be asserted against us.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws\nand regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or\nproduction efforts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In\naddition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or they publish negative\nreports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry\nanalysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these\nanalysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our\nshare price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly\npublish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading\nvolume to decline.\nDelaware law contains anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our\nstockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be\nbeneficial to our stockholders. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make the acquisition of our\ncompany and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding 15% or\nmore of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring us, without the consent of our board of directors, for at least\nthree years from the date they first hold 15% or more of the voting stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be\nthe exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholdersâ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the\nexclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary\nduty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate\nof incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or\nduty created by the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive\njurisdiction. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the U.S.\nof America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of\n67\nany complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The choice of forum provision may limit a\nstockholderâs ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other\nemployees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of\nincorporation and our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated\nwith resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operation.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nWe recognize the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of customers, clients, patients, business\npartners and employees toward our business and are committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of our business operations and systems. Our board of directors is actively involved in oversight of our risk\nmanagement activities, and cybersecurity represents an important element of our overall approach to risk management.\nOur cybersecurity standards, processes and practices are based on recognized frameworks established by the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, the International Organization for Standardization and other applicable\nindustry standards. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a comprehensive, cross-functional\napproach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality, security and availability of the information that we collect and\nstore by identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity\nincidents when they occur.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy ; Effect of Risk\nWe face risks related to cybersecurity such as unauthorized access, cybersecurity attacks and other security\nincidents, including as perpetrated by hackers and unintentional damage or disruption to hardware and software systems,\nloss of data, and misappropriation of confidential information. To identify and assess material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats, we work with a third-party cyber specialist to ensure our systems are effective and prepared for information\nsecurity risks, including regular oversight of our programs for security monitoring for internal and external threats to\nensure the confidentiality and integrity of our information assets. We consider risks from cybersecurity threats alongside\nother company risks as part of our overall risk assessment process. As discussed in more detail under âCybersecurity\nGovernanceâ below, our audit committee provides oversight of our cybersecurity risk management and strategy\nprocesses, which are led by Chief Executive Officer.\nWe also identify our cybersecurity threat risks by comparing our processes to standards set by the National Institute\nof Standards and Technology, or NIST, International Organization for Standardization, Center for Internet Security as\nwell as by engaging experts to attempt to infiltrate our information systems. To provide for the availability of critical\ndata and systems, maintain regulatory compliance, manage our material risks from cybersecurity threats, and protect\nagainst and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we undertake the following activities:\nâ¢ monitor emerging data protection laws and implement changes to our processes that are designed to comply\nwith such laws;\nâ¢ through our policies, practices and contracts (as applicable), require employees, as well as third parties that\nprovide services on our behalf, to treat confidential information and data with care;\nâ¢ employ technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats,\nincluding firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls,\nwhich are evaluated and improved through vulnerability assessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence;\n68\nâ¢ provide regular, mandatory training for our employees and contractors regarding cybersecurity threats as a\nmeans to equip them with effective tools to address cybersecurity threats, and to communicate our evolving\ninformation security policies, standards, processes and practices;\nâ¢ conduct regular phishing email simulations for all employees and contractors with access to our email systems\nto enhance awareness and responsiveness to possible threats;\nâ¢ conduct annual cybersecurity management and incident training for employees involved in our systems and\nprocesses that handle sensitive data; and\nâ¢ leverage the NIST incident handling framework to help us identify, protect, detect, respond and recover when\nthere is an actual or potential cybersecurity incident.\nOur incident response plan coordinates the activities we take to prepare for, detect, respond to and recover from\ncybersecurity incidents, which include processes to triage, assess severity for, escalate, contain, investigate and\nremediate the incident, as well as to comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate damage to our\nbusiness and reputation.\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage with a third-party cyber specialist to review our cybersecurity\nprogram to help identify areas for continued focus, improvement and compliance.\nOur processes also address cybersecurity threat risks associated with our use of third-party service providers,\nincluding our suppliers and manufacturers or who have access to patient and employee data or our systems. In addition,\ncybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of our third-party service providers. We perform diligence\non third parties that have access to our systems, data or facilities that house such systems or data, and continually\nmonitor cybersecurity threat risks identified through such diligence. Additionally, we generally require those third\nparties that could introduce significant cybersecurity risk to us to agree by contract to manage their cybersecurity risks in\nspecified ways, and to agree to be subject to cybersecurity audits.\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous\ncybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business\nstrategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading âCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could\nresult in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss,â which disclosures are\nincorporated by reference herein.\nIn the last three fiscal years, we have not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents and the expenses we have\nincurred from cybersecurity incidents were immaterial. This includes penalties and settlements, of which there were\nnone.\nCybersecurity Governance; Management\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our board of directors\nand management. The audit committee of our board of directors is responsible for the oversight of risks from\ncybersecurity threats.\nOn an annual basis, our audit committee receives an update from management of our cybersecurity threat risk\nmanagement and strategy processes covering topics such as data security posture, results from third-party assessments,\nprogress towards pre-determined risk-mitigation-related goals, our incident response plan, and material cybersecurity\nthreat risks or incidents and developments, as well as the steps management has taken to respond to such risks. In such\nsessions, our audit committee generally receives materials discussing current cyber risks and threats specific to our\norganization and industry, progress and status updates on projects aimed at fortifying our information security\ninfrastructure, comprehensive evaluations of our ongoing information security program's effectiveness, and analysis of\nthe evolving cyber threat landscape and its potential implications for our operations. and discusses such matters with our\nChief Executive Officer. Our audit committee also receives prompt and timely information regarding any cybersecurity\n69\nincident that meets establishing reporting thresholds, as well as ongoing updates regarding any such incident until it has\nbeen addressed.\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes, which are discussed in greater detail above, are led by\nour Chief Executive Officer, with the assistance of a third-party cyber specialist. Our Chief Executive Officer and third-\nparty cyber specialist have collectively over 25 years of prior work experience in various roles involving managing\ninformation security, developing cybersecurity strategy, implementing effective information and cybersecurity programs,\nand our third-party cyber specialist has several relevant degrees and certifications. Our Chief Executive Officer is\ninformed about and monitors the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through\nthe management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above,\nincluding the operation of our incident response plan. As discussed above, our Chief Executive Officer reports to the\naudit committee of our board of directors about cybersecurity threat risks, among other cybersecurity related matters, on\nan annual basis.\nItem 2. Properties.\nOur headquarters is located in Staten Island, New York, where we lease a total of approximately 150 square feet of\noffice.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to\nany litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on\nour business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement\ncosts, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nItem 4.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related\nfinancing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors,\nincluding those factors set forth in the âRisk Factorsâ section of this Form 10-K, our actual results could differ\nmaterially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following\ndiscussion and analysis.\n71\nInvestors and others should note that we routinely use the Investor Relations section of our website to announce\nmaterial information to investors and the marketplace. While not all of the information that we post on the Investor\nRelations section of our website is of a material nature, some information could be deemed to be material. Accordingly,\nwe encourage investors, the media, and others interested in us to review the information that it shares on the Investors\nsection of our website, www.acurxpharma.com.\nOverview\nAcurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (the âCompanyâ), a Delaware corporation, formerly Acurx Pharmaceuticals, LLC (the\nâCompanyâ) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of antibiotics for infections caused\nby bacteria listed as priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (âWHOâ), the U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (âCDCâ) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (âFDAâ). Priority pathogens are those\nwhich require new antibiotics to address the worldwide crisis of antimicrobial resistance (âAMRâ) as identified by the\nWHO, CDC and FDA. The CDC estimates that, in the U.S., antibiotic-resistant pathogens infect one individual every\n11 seconds and result in one death every 15 minutes. The WHO recently stated that growing antimicrobial resistance is\nequally as dangerous as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and may\nleave us defenseless against infections that today can be treated easily. According to the WHO, the current clinical\ndevelopment pipeline remains insufficient to tackle the challenge of the increasing emergence and spread of\nantimicrobial resistance.\nOur approach is to develop a new class of antibiotic candidates that block the DNA polymerase IIIC (âpol IIICâ).\nWe believe we are developing the first pol IIIC inhibitor to enter clinical trials and have clinically validated the bacterial\ntarget by demonstrating the efficacy of our lead antibiotic candidate in a Phase 2a clinical trial. pol IIIC is the primary\ncatalyst for DNA replication of several Gram-positive bacterial cells. Our research and development pipeline includes\nclinical stage and early stage antibiotic candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria for oral and/or parenteral treatment\nof infections caused by Clostridium difficile (âC. difficileâ), Enterococcus (including vancomycin-resistant strains\n(âVREâ)), Staphylococcus (including methicillin-resistant strains), and Streptococcus (including antibiotic resistant\nstrains).\nPol IIIC is required for the replication of DNA in certain Gram-positive bacterial species. By blocking this enzyme,\nour antibiotic candidates are believed to be bactericidal and inhibit proliferation of several common Gram-positive\nbacterial pathogens, including both sensitive and resistant C. difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n(âMRSAâ), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (âPRSPâ) and other\nresistant bacteria.\nWe intend to âde-riskâ this new class of antibiotics through our drug development activities and potentially partner\nwith a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company for late-stage clinical trials and commercialization.\nOur lead antibiotic candidate, ibezapolstat (formerly named ACX-362E), has a novel mechanism of action that\ntargets the pol IIIC enzyme, a previously unexploited scientific target. Phase 2a clinical efficacy of our lead antibiotic\nvalidate the pol IIIC bacterial target. On December 3, 2021, we commenced enrollment in a Phase 2b 64-patient,\nrandomized (1-to-1), non-inferiority, double-blind, trial of oral ibezapolstat compared to oral vancomycin, a standard of\ncare to treat C. difficile infections (âCDIâ).\nPrior to that, we completed our Phase 2a clinical trial of ibezapolstat to treat patients with CDI and reported the top-\nline data in November 2020. The Phase 2a clinical trial was terminated early based upon the recommendation of our\nScientific Advisory Board (the âSABâ). The SAB reviewed the study data presented by management, including adverse\nevents and efficacy outcomes, and discussed its clinical impressions. The SAB unanimously supported the early\ntermination of the Phase 2a trial after 10 patients were enrolled in the trial instead of 20 patients as originally planned.\nThe early termination was further based on the evidence of meeting the treatment goals of eliminating the infection with\nan acceptable adverse event profile.\nThe SAB noted that 10 out of 10 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a trial reached the Clinical Cure endpoint, defined\nin the study protocol as the resolution of diarrhea in the 24-hour period immediately before the end of treatment that is\n72\nmaintained for 48 hours after end of treatment. Such cure was sustained, meaning that the patients showed no sign of\ninfection recurrence, for 30 days thereafter. This constitutes a 100% response rate for the primary and secondary\nendpoints of the trial. All 10 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a trial met the studyâs primary and secondary efficacy\nendpoints, namely, Clinical Cure at end of treatment and Sustained Clinical Cure of no recurrence of CDI at the 28-day\nfollow-up visit. No treatment-related serious adverse events (âSAEsâ) were reported by the investigators who enrolled\npatients in the trial. We believe these results represent the first-ever clinical data showing pol IIIC has potential as a\ntherapeutically relevant antibacterial target. Our Phase 2b clinical trial commenced enrollment on December 3, 2021.\nCurrently available antibiotics used to treat CDI infections utilize other mechanisms of action. We believe\nibezapolstat is the first antibiotic candidate to work by blocking the DNA pol IIIC enzyme in C. difficile. This enzyme is\nnecessary for replication of the DNA of certain Gram-positive bacteria, like C. difficile.\nWe also have an early stage pipeline of antibiotic product candidates with the same previously unexploited\nmechanism of action which has established proof of concept in animal studies. This pipeline includes ACX-375C, a\npotential oral and parenteral treatment targeting Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA, VRE and PRSP.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash of approximately $7.5 million.\nRecent Developments\nCompletion of Phase 2b Clinical Trial\nOn October 2, 2023, we discontinued our Phase 2b clinical trial of our lead antibiotic candidate, ibezapolstat,\ntargeting the treatment of patients with CDI and anticipate advancing to Phase 3 clinical trials more expeditiously than\noriginally planned. We made the decision to discontinue the Phase 2b clinical trial in consultation with our medical and\nscientific advisors and statisticians based upon observed aggregate blinded data and other factors, including the cost to\nmaintain clinical trial sites and slow enrollment due to COVID-19.\nWe determined that the Phase 2b clinical trial has performed as anticipated for each of ibezapolstat, our lead\nantibiotic candidate, and vancomycin, the control agent and a standard of care to treat patients with CDI, with high rates\nof clinical cure observed across the trial and no emerging safety concerns reported to date. Accordingly, the\nIndependent Data Monitoring Committee will not be required to perform an interim analysis of the Phase 2b clinical trial\ndata as originally planned but is supportive of our decision to early discontinue the Phase 2b clinical trial and will remain\ninvolved for our Phase 3 clinical trials. Prior to discontinuing the Phase 2b clinical trial, we notified FDA of its decision\nto early discontinue the trial. The trial was not discontinued due to safety concerns.\nTop-Line Ibezapolstat Phase 2 Efficacy Results\nOn November 2, 2023, we announced top-line Phase 2 efficacy and safety results from the clinical trial of\nibezapolstat in patients with CDI. The overall observed Clinical Cure rate in the combined Phase 2 trials in patients with\nCDI was 96% (25 out of 26 patients), based on 10 out of 10 patients (100%) in Phase 2a in the modified intent to treat\npopulation, plus 15 out of 16 (94%) patients in Phase 2b in the per protocol population, who experienced Clinical Cure\nduring treatment with ibezapolstat. Ibezapolstat was well-tolerated, with three patients each experiencing one mild\nadverse event assessed by the blinded investigator to be drug-related. All three events were gastrointestinal in nature and\nresolved without treatment. There were no drug-related treatment withdrawals or no drug-related serious adverse events,\nor other safety findings of concern. In the Phase 2b vancomycin control arm, 14 out of 14 patients experienced clinical\ncure. We believe that based on the pooled Phase 2 ibezapolstat clinical cure rate of 96% and the historical vancomycin\ncure rate of approximately 81% (VancocinÂ® Prescribing Information, January 2021), we will demonstrate non-\ninferiority of ibezapolstat to vancomycin in Phase 3 trials in accordance with the applicable FDA Guidance for Industry\n(October, 2022). The Phase 2b clinical trial met the protocol primary objective of assessing the primary efficacy\nendpoint of the Clinical Cure rate after 10 days of oral treatment. Further analyses will be forthcoming regarding\nsecondary and exploratory endpoints, including Sustained Clinical Cure data, Extended Clinical Cure data up to 94 days\nand comparative effects on the gut microbiome.\n73\nWe are currently preparing for an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with FDA and advancement to Phase 3.\n2023 At-the-Market Offering\nOn November 15, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established the âATM Programâ, pursuant to which\nwe may offer and sell, from time to time through A.G.P/Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of its common\nstock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the Sales Agreement, the sales agent is entitled to\ncompensation of 3% of the gross offering proceeds of all Shares sold through it pursuant to the Sales Agreement.\nAs of the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 698,121 shares of its common stock under the ATM Program at a\nweighted-average price of $3.76 per share, raising $2.6 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of $2.4 million, after\ndeducting commissions to the sales agents and other ATM Program related expenses. There remains approximately\n$14.4 million available for future sales of shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement. Other than the Sales\nAgreement, we currently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds.\n2023 Registered Direct Offering\nOn May 16, 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the âPurchase Agreementâ) with a single\nhealthcare-focused U.S. institutional investor named therein (the â2023 Investorâ), pursuant to which we issued and sold,\nin a registered direct offering by us directly to the 2023 Investor (the â2023 Registered Offeringâ), an aggregate of\n601,851 shares of common stock at an offering price of $3.00 per share and an aggregate of 731,482 pre-funded warrants\nexercisable for shares of common stock at an offering price of $2.9999 per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants\nsold to the 2023 Investor have an exercise price of $0.0001 and were immediately exercisable. As of September 30,\n2023, all of the pre-funded warrants were exercised.\nThe gross proceeds to us from the 2023 Registered Offering were approximately $4.0 million and net proceeds after\ndeducting the placements agentâs fees and other offering expenses payable by us were approximately $3.5 million. The\nsecurities were offered by us pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-265956) previously filed\nwith the SEC on July 1, 2022, and which was declared effective by the SEC on July 11, 2022.\nIn a concurrent private placement (the â2023 Private Placementâ and together with the 2023 Registered Offering,\nthe â2023 Offeringsâ), we issued to the Investor series C warrants exercisable for an aggregate of up to 1,333,333 shares\nof common Stock at an exercise price of $3.26 per share and series D warrants exercisable for an aggregate of up to\n1,333,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.26 per share. Each Series C Warrant was exercisable\ncommencing on November 18, 2023 and will expire on November 18, 2025. Each Series D Warrant was exercisable\ncommencing on November 18, 2023 and will expire on November 19, 2029.\nThe 2023 Offerings closed on May 18, 2023.\nIn connection with the 2023 Offerings, we also entered into a Warrant Amendment Agreement with the 2023\nInvestor. Under the Warrant Amendment Agreement, we amended its existing series A warrants to purchase up to an\naggregate of 1,230,769 shares of our common stock and series B warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of\n1,230,769 shares of our common stock (collectively, the âExisting Warrantsâ) that were previously issued in July 2022,\nsuch that effective upon the closing of the 2023 Offerings, the Existing Warrants were amended to have a termination\ndate of May 18, 2029.\nOn May 16, 2023, we entered into a placement agency agreement (the â2023 Placement Agent Agreementâ) with\nMaxim Group LLC (the âPlacement Agentâ) pursuant to which we engaged Maxim as the placement agent in connection\nwith the 2023 Offerings. The Placement Agent agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for the sale of the\nSecurities. We paid the Placement Agent a placement agent fee in cash equal to 5.75% of the gross proceeds from the\nsale of the Shares, Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants. We also reimbursed the Placement Agent for all reasonable travel\nand other out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees of legal counsel not to exceed $50,000. The 2023\nPlacement Agent Agreement also contained representations, warranties, indemnification and other provisions customary\nfor transactions of this nature.\n74\nEffects of Coronavirus (COVID-19) on Our Business\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. Notably, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations or those of our\ncollaborators, vendors, contractors, suppliers, clinical trial sites and other material business relations and governmental\nagencies will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence,\nincluding the ultimate duration of the outbreak, new information that will emerge concerning the severity of the virus\nand the actions to contain it or treat its impact, among others. Previously, our clinical trial operations were directly and\nindirectly impacted, and could continue to be directly and indirectly impacted, by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the\npotential economic impact brought by, and the ultimate duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic, have been, and continue\nto be, difficult to assess or predict, the spread of COVID-19 has caused a broad impact globally. The extent to which the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may impact our business continues to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with\nconfidence.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of\nproducts in the near future, if at all.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nTo date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to development of ibezapolstat, preclinical\nstudies and other preclinical activities related to our portfolio. Research and development expenses are recognized as\nincurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are\ncapitalized until the goods or services are received.\nResearch and development expenses include:\nâ¢ external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or\nCROs, and consultants to conduct our preclinical, toxicology and other preclinical studies;\nâ¢ laboratory supplies;\nâ¢ costs related to manufacturing product candidates, including fees paid to third-party manufacturers and raw\nmaterial suppliers;\nâ¢ license fees and research funding; and\nâ¢ facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent,\nmaintenance of facilities, insurance, equipment and other supplies.\nClinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated\nwith third-party contractors. We outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing external entities\nsuch as CROs, independent clinical investigators and other third-party service providers to assist us with the execution of\nour clinical trials.\nWe plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue\nthe development of our product candidates and seek to discover and develop new product candidates. Due to the\ninherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development, we cannot determine with certainty the timing of\nthe initiation, duration or costs of future clinical trials and preclinical studies of product candidates. Clinical and\npreclinical development timelines, the probability of success and the amount of development costs can differ materially\nfrom expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates and development\nprograms to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate or program on an ongoing basis in\nresponse to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our\nongoing assessments as to each product candidateâs commercial potential. In addition, we cannot forecast which product\n75\ncandidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree\nsuch arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.\nOur future clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:\nâ¢ per-patient trial costs;\nâ¢ the number of trials required for regulatory approval;\nâ¢ the number of sites included in the trials;\nâ¢ the countries in which the trials are conducted;\nâ¢ the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;\nâ¢ the number of patients that participate in the trials;\nâ¢ the number of doses that patients receive;\nâ¢ the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\nâ¢ potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;\nâ¢ the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;\nâ¢ the phase of development of the product candidate; and\nâ¢ the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based\ncompensation, for personnel in our executive, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include\nfacility-related costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting\nand consulting services and insurance costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in\nthe future to support our continued research and development activities, pre-commercialization and, if any product\ncandidates receive marketing approval, commercialization activities. We also anticipate increased expenses related to\naudit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC\nrequirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with operating as a public\ncompany.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYears E nd ed\nDecember 31, Percentage\n2023 2022 Change\n(in thousands)\nOPERATING EXPENSES:\nResearch and Development $ 6,044 $ 4,754 27 %\nGeneral and Administrative 8,534 7,339 16 %\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES 14,578 12,093 21 %\nNet Loss $ (14,578) $ (12,093) 21 %\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $6.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $1.2 million primarily due to\nincrease in consulting related costs for the Phase 2b clinical trial.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $8.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. General and administrative expenses\n76\nincreased by approximately $1.2 million primarily due to $0.5 million increase in professional fees, $0.3 million increase\nin share-based compensation costs, and a $0.3 million increase in employee compensation related costs.\nNet Loss. Net loss was $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $12.1 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $2.5 million, primarily due to the reasons stated above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, we have generated no revenue from operations and we have incurred cumulative losses of\napproximately $53.2 million as of December 31, 2023. We have funded our operations primarily from equity issuances.\nWe received net cash proceeds of approximately $12.9 million from equity financings closed between March 2018 and\nOctober 2020. On June 29, 2021, we completed our IPO resulting in net proceeds of approximately $14.8 million after\ndeducting underwriter discounts of $1.4 million and offering costs of approximately $1.1 million. On July 27, 2022, we\ncompleted a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement resulting in net proceeds of approximately\n$3.7 million after deducting the placement agents commission of $0.3 million and offering costs of $0.2 million. On\nMay 18, 2023, we completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement resulting proceeds of\napproximately $3.5 million after deducting the placement agents fee of $0.2 million and offering costs of $0.2 million.\nOn November 15, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established the ATM Program, pursuant to which we\nmay offer and sell, from time to time, through A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of our common\nstock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the ATM Program, we raised net proceeds of\napproximately $2.4 million after deducting sales agent commission and other related expenses of $0.2 million.\nBased upon our lack of revenue expected for the foreseeable future, and because of numerous risks and uncertainties\nassociated with the research, development and future commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to\nestimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our\nanticipated clinical trials and development activities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had working capital of $4.7 million, consisting primarily of $7.5 million of cash,\n$0.1 million of other receivable and $0.1 million of prepaid expenses, offset by $3.0 million of accounts payable and\naccrued expenses.\nSources of Liquidity\nTo date, we have financed our operations principally through private placements of equity issuances, the IPO,\nregistered direct offerings and the ATM Program.\nClass A Membership Financings\nWe have funded our operations primarily from equity issuances. We received net cash proceeds of approximately\n$12.9 million from equity financings closed between March 2018 and October 2020 starting with investments from the\nco-founders. All of our equity financings were consummated at a price ranging from $1.00 per Class A Membership\nInterest (March 2018) to $3.25 per Class A Membership Interest (July 2020 and October 2020). Warrant coverage was\nprovided in all but our most-recent financing and the warrant coverage in our early-stage financings ranged from\n25% warrant coverage to 50% warrant coverage, in each case, with a conversion price equal to the issue price in each\noffering.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan\nIn May 2020, we received a PPP Loan under the CARES ACT, as administered by the SBA in the amount of\n$66,503. We did not provide any collateral or guarantees in connection with the PPP Loan, nor did we pay any facility\ncharge to obtain the PPP Loan. The PPP Loan carried an annual interest rate of 0.98% and was scheduled to mature\ntwo (2) years from issuance. On April 13, 2021, the SBA authorized the full forgiveness of the PPP Loan. Upon\nforgiveness of the PPP Loan, we reduced the liability and recorded a gain on the forgiveness of the PPP Loan in the\nstatement of operations.\n77\nInitial Public Offering\nIn June 2021, we completed the IPO and issued and sold an aggregate 2,875,000 shares of common stock, which\nincluded 375,000 shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the underwritersâ option to purchase additional shares,\nat a public offering price of $6.00 per share, for net cash proceeds of $14.8 million after deducting underwriting\ndiscounts and commissions and other offering costs.\nRegistered Direct Offerings\nIn July 2022, we completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement, issuing 1,159,211 shares\nof common stock and 130,769 pre-funded warrants and series A warrants to purchase 1,289,980 shares of common stock\nand series B warrants to purchase 1,289,980 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $4.2 million.\nOn May 18, 2023, we completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement, issuing\n601,851 shares of common stock, 731,482 pre-funded warrants, series C warrants to purchase 1,333,333 shares of\ncommon stock and series D warrants to purchase 1,333,333 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately\n$4.0 million.\n2023 At-the-Market Offering\nOn November 15, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement and established the ATM Program, pursuant to which\nwe may offer and sell, from time to time through A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent, shares of our common\nstock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the sales agreement, the sales agent is entitled to\ncompensation of 3% of the gross offering proceeds of all Shares sold through it pursuant to the Sales Agreement.\nAs of the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 698,121 shares of its common stock under the ATM Program at a\nweighted-average price of $3.76 per share, raising $2.6 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of $2.4 million, after\ndeducting commissions to the sales agents and other ATM Program related expenses. There remains approximately\n$14.4 million available for future sales of shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement. Other than the Sales\nAgreement, we currently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the net cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022:\nYears E nd ed\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nNet cash (used in)/provided by:\nOperating activities $ (9,801) $ (7,542)\nFinancing activities 8,163 3,695\nNet decrease in cash $ (1,638) $ (3,847)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily attributable\nto the net loss of $14.6 million, offset by share-based compensation of $3.2 million, share-based payments to vendors of\n$0.6 million and an increase of $1.0 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily attributable\nto the net loss of $12.1 million, offset by share-based compensation of $2.9 million, share-based payments to vendors of\n$0.4 million and an increase of $1.2 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n78\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities were none for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was\nattributable to the net proceeds from the 2023 registered direct offering of $3.5 million, net proceeds from the ATM\nProgram of $2.4 million and $2.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was\nattributable to the net proceeds from the registered direct offering.\nFunding Requirements\nWe believe that our existing cash will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least\n12 months from the issuance of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. However, our forecast of\nthe period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking\nstatement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially, including with regard to the\nimpact of COVID-19 on our clinical trial enrollment. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be\nwrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nâ¢ the timing, progress, and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates;\nâ¢ our ability to manufacture sufficient clinical supply of our product candidates and the costs thereof;\nâ¢ discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the design and conduct of our clinical trials and the costs, timing\nand outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\nâ¢ the cost and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales\nand distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\nâ¢ the costs of any other product candidates or technologies we pursue;\nâ¢ our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial\nterms of such agreements;\nâ¢ the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of any product candidates for which we receive marketing\napproval; and\nâ¢ the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our\nintellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues to support our capital requirements, we\nexpect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings,\ncollaborations and licensing arrangements or other capital sources. To the extent that we raise additional capital through\nthe sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted,\nand the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our\ncommon stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants\nlimiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures\nor declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may\nneed to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs or may have to\ngrant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are\nunable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings as and when needed, we may be required to delay,\nlimit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and\nmarket our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates\nourselves.\n79\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting pronouncements as of December 31, 2023\nthat will become effective in subsequent periods; however, we do not believe that any of those pronouncements would\nhave significantly affected our financial accounting measurements or disclosures had they been in effect during 2023, or\nthat they will have a significant impact on us at the time they become effective.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nResearch and Development\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. At times, we may make cash advances for future research\nand development services. These amounts are deferred and expensed in the period the services are provided.\nCosts for certain research and development activities, such as the provision of services for clinical trial activity, are\nestimated based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks which may use data such as subject\nenrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors with respect to their actual costs\nincurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the\npattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development\nexpense, as the case may be. The estimates are adjusted to reflect the best information available at the time of the\nfinancial statement issuance. Although we do not expect its estimates to be materially different from amounts actually\nincurred, our estimate of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services\nperformed may vary.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for the cost of services performed by employees, officers and directors received in exchange for an\naward of Company membership interests, common stock or stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of the\naward. We recognize compensation expense based on the requisite service period.\nCompensation expense associated with stock option awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on\nthe fair value of the option at the grant date determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option\nvaluation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected price volatility. Our\nemployee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the\nsubjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value computation using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. Because there is no public market for our stock options and very little historical experience with our stock,\nsimilar public companies were used for the comparison of volatility and the dividend yield. The risk-free rate of return\nwas derived from U.S. Treasury notes with comparable maturities. We will continue to analyze the expected stock price\nvolatility and will adjust our Black-Scholes option pricing assumptions as appropriate. Any changes in the foregoing\nBlack-Scholes assumptions, or if we were to elect to utilize an alternative method for valuing stock options granted to\nemployees, officers and directors, could potentially impact our stock-based compensation expense and our results of\noperations.\nShare-Based Payments to Vendors\nWe account for the cost of services performed by vendors in exchange for an award of our membership interests,\ncommon stock, or stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of the award or the fair value of the services rendered;\n80\nwhichever is more readily determinable. We also use Black-Scholes option pricing model for the purpose of estimating\nthe fair value of options and warrants. Changes in our Black-Scholes assumptions, or if we were to utilize an alternative\nmethod for valuing options or warrants issued to our vendors, could impact our expense and our results of operations.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate\nrisks, foreign currency exchange rate risks and inflation risks. Periodically, we maintain deposits in accredited financial\ninstitutions in excess of federally insured limits. We deposit our cash in financial institutions that we believe have high\ncredit quality and have not experienced any significant losses on such accounts and do not believe we are exposed to any\nunusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nAll of our employees and our operations are currently located in the United States. We have, from time to time,\nengaged in contracts with contractors or other vendors in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. To date, we have had\nminimal exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the time period between the date that transactions\nare initiated and the date of payment or receipt of payment is generally of short duration. Accordingly, we believe we do\nnot have a material exposure to foreign currency risk.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and research and development contract costs. We do not\nbelieve inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe financial statements and related financial statement schedules required to be filed are listed in the Index to\nFinancial Statements and are incorporated in Item 15 of Part IV of this Form 10-K.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain âdisclosure controls and procedures,â as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the SECâs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file\nor submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal\nexecutive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how\nwell designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management\nnecessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this\nForm 10-K of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and\nevaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\n81\nobjectives. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by\nthis Form 10-K.\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe can give no assurance that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be\nidentified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could\nresult in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and cause us to\nfail to meet our reporting obligations.\nManagementâs Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial\nreporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.\nOur management conducted an assessment of the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the criteria set forth in âInternal Control â Integrated Framework\n(2013)â issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective\nas of December 31, 2023.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm\ndue to an exemption established by the JOBS Act for âemerging growth companiesâ. Additionally, our independent\nregistered public accounting firm will not be required to opine on our internal control over financial reporting until we\nare no longer an emerging growth company.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange\nAct) identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our\nlast fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nNone of our directors or officers have adopted, modified, or terminated any trading plans under Rule10b5-1 of the\nExchange Act or any similar arrangements during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot applicable.\n82\nPART III\nItem 10.

All\nmembers of the Compensation Committee qualify as independent under the definition promulgated by The Nasdaq Stock\nMarket.\nOur Compensation Committee has adopted processes and procedures for determining executive and director\ncompensation. Generally, our Compensation Committee evaluates and approves our compensation practices for the\ncurrent year and determines compensation levels. The Compensation Committee annually evaluates the Chief Executive\nOfficerâs performance in light of relevant corporate goals and objectives, and approves, or recommends to the board of\ndirectors for approval, the Chief Executive Officerâs compensation. For executives other than the Chief Executive\nOfficer, our Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves, or recommends to the board of directors for\napproval, the compensation of such executive officers.

In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(2) of the Nasdaq rules, a\nmajority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The\nboard of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly\nselecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. As there is no\nstanding nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.\nThe board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders\nduring such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders\n(or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders).\nWe have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary\nfor directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers\neducational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional\nreputation, independence, wisdom and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe positions of our executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer are separated, with Mr. Luci\nserving as our Chief Executive Officer and Mr. DeLuccia serving as the executive chairman of our board of directors.\nSeparating these positions allows Mr. Luci, as our Chief Executive Officer, to focus on our day-to-day business, while\nallowing the chairman of the board to lead the board of directors in its fundamental role of providing advice to and\nindependent oversight of management. Our board of directors believes that this structure ensures a greater role for the\nindependent directors in the oversight of our company and active participation of the independent directors in setting\nagendas and establishing priorities and procedures for the work of our board of directors. Our board of directors believes\nits administration of its risk oversight function has not affected its leadership structure. Our board of directors believes\nthat having separate positions is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time and demonstrates our commitment\nto good corporate governance.\nRole in Risk Oversight\nOur board of directors oversees the management of risks inherent in the operation of our business and the\nimplementation of our business strategies. Our board of directors performs this oversight role by using several different\nlevels of review. In connection with its reviews of our operations and corporate functions, our board of directors\naddresses the primary risks associated with those operations and corporate functions. In addition, our board of directors\nreviews the risks associated with our business strategies periodically throughout the year as part of its consideration of\nundertaking any such business strategies.\nEach of our board committees also oversees the management of our risks that fall within the committeeâs areas of\nresponsibility. In performing this function, each committee has full access to management, as well as the ability to\nengage advisors. Our Chief Executive Officer reports risk management controls and methodologies to the Audit\nCommittee and is responsible for identifying, evaluating and implementing risk management controls and methodologies\nto address any identified risks. In connection with its risk management role, our Audit Committee meets privately with\nrepresentatives from our independent registered public accounting firm and our Chief Executive Officer. The Audit\nCommittee oversees the operation of our risk management program, including the identification of the primary risks\nassociated with our business and periodic updates to such risks, and reports to our board of directors regarding these\nactivities.\n88\nExecutive Officers\nSet forth below are the names, ages and positions of each of our executive officers.\nDavid P.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nCertain Relationships and Related Person Transactions\nOur Audit Committee Charter requires all future transactions between us and any director, executive officer, holder\nof 5% or more of any class of our capital stock or any member of the immediate family of, or entities affiliated with, any\nof them, or any other related persons, as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K, or their affiliates, in which the amount\ninvolved is equal to or greater than $120,000, be approved in advance by our Audit Committee. Any request for such a\ntransaction must first be presented to our Audit Committee for review, consideration and approval. In approving or\nrejecting any such proposal, our Audit Committee is to consider all available information deemed relevant by the Audit\nCommittee, including, but not limited to, the extent of the related personâs interest in the transaction and whether the\ntransaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms we could have generally obtained from an unaffiliated third\nparty under the same or similar circumstances. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have\nengaged in the following transactions:\nInvestor Rights Agreements\nWe have entered into investor rights agreements with the investors who participated in our private placement\nfinancings between March 2018 and October 2019, including Messrs.

Each such investor rights agreement imposes certain affirmative obligations on us and also grants certain rights to\nsuch investors, including certain registration rights with respect to the securities held by them and certain additional\nrights.\nIndemnification Agreements\nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers (the\nâIndemnification Agreementsâ). Such Indemnification Agreements provide for indemnification against expenses,\njudgments, fines and penalties actually and reasonably incurred by an indemnitee in connection with threatened, pending\nor completed actions, suits or other proceedings, subject to certain limitations. The Indemnification Agreements also\nprovide for the advancement of expenses in connection with a proceeding prior to a final, non-appealable judgment or\nother adjudication, provided that the indemnitee provides an undertaking to repay to us any amounts advanced if the\nindemnitee is ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification by us. The Indemnification Agreements set forth\nprocedures for making and responding to requests for indemnification or advancement of expenses, as well as dispute\nresolution procedures that will apply to any dispute between us and an indemnitee arising under the Indemnification\nAgreements.\nParticipation in Our July 2022 Registered Direct Offering and Concurrent Private Placement\nIn July 2022, we issued and sold in a registered direct offering (i) an aggregate of 1,159,211 shares of our common\nstock (âSharesâ) (consisting of 1,100,000 shares for single healthcare-focused U.S. institutional investor (the âInvestorâ)\nand an aggregate of 59,211 for David P.

We have furnished the foregoing disclosure to\nCohnReznick LLP.\nPolicy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Public\nAccountant\nConsistent with SEC policies regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for\nappointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. In\nrecognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible\nnon-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.\n97\nPrior to engagement of an independent registered public accounting firm for the next yearâs audit, management will\nsubmit an aggregate of services expected to be rendered during that year for each of four categories of services to the\nAudit Committee for approval.\n1. Audit services include audit work performed in the preparation of financial statements, as well as work that\ngenerally only an independent registered public accounting firm can reasonably be expected to provide, including\ncomfort letters, statutory audits and attest services and consultation regarding financial accounting and/or reporting\nstandards.\n2. Audit-Related services are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, including due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, employee benefit plan\naudits and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory requirements.\n3. Tax services include all services performed by an independent registered public accounting firmâs tax personnel\nexcept those services specifically related to the audit of the financial statements, and includes fees in the areas of tax\ncompliance, tax planning and tax advice.\n4. Other Fees are those associated with services not captured in the other categories. The Company generally does\nnot request such services from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nPrior to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted\nand the Audit Committee requires our independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual\nfees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise\nwhen it may become necessary to engage our independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not\ncontemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before\nengaging our independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom\nsuch authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit\nCommittee at its next scheduled meeting.\n98\nPART IV\nItem 15.

(the âCompanyâ) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholdersâ equity and cash flows for the years\nthen ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the âfinancial statementsâ). In our opinion, the financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations\nsince inception and has stated that substantial doubt exists about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement's evaluation of the events and conditions and management's plans regarding these matters are also\ndescribed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this\nuncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companyâs management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (âPCAOBâ) and are required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompanyâs internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

The\nCompany is focused on developing a novel class of antibiotics that address serious or life threatening bacterial\ninfections.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, a\nglobal pandemic. This outbreak caused major disruptions to businesses and markets worldwide as the virus continued to\nspread. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and the Company expects it will continue to disrupt, its operations. The\nextent of the effect on the Companyâs operational and financial performance will depend on future developments,\nincluding the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, and governmental, regulatory and private sector responses,\ndirect and indirect economic effects as a result of inflation, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages all of which are\nuncertain and difficult to predict. Although the Company is unable to estimate the financial effect of the pandemic, at\nthis time, if the pandemic continues over a long period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on the Companyâs\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The financial statements do not reflect any\nadjustments as a result of the pandemic.\nIn February 2018, the Company purchased the active pharmaceutical ingredient, the intellectual property and other rights\nto an antibiotic product candidate known as GLS362E (renamed ACX-362E and now approved for non-proprietary\nname, ibezapolstat) (the âAssetâ) from GLSynthesis, Inc. The Company paid $110,174 in cash, along with granting\n100,000 Class B Membership Interests, profits interests as defined in the operating agreement, with an exercise price of\n$0.10 per share. The Company was also required to make certain milestone payments totaling $700,000 in aggregate if\ncertain milestones are achieved, $50,000 of which has already been paid by the Company and royalty payments equal to\n4% of net sales for a period of time equal to the last to expire of any applicable patents, as defined in the asset purchase\nagreement. The purchase of the Asset has resulted in our lead antibiotic product candidate, ibezapolstat, which targets\nthe treatment of C. difficile infections (âCDIâ).\nThe Companyâs primary activities since inception aside from organizational activities have included performing research\nand development activities relating to the development of its two antibiotic candidates and raising funds through equity\nofferings including its initial public offering (âIPOâ) consummated in June 2021. The Company has not generated any\nrevenues since inception.\nThe Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these\nconditions to continue for the foreseeable future. The Company has needed to raise capital from sales of its securities to\nsustain operations. On June 29, 2021, the Company completed the IPO, issuing 2,875,000 shares of common stock at a\nprice of $6.00 per share, with gross proceeds of approximately $17.3 million. On July 27, 2022, the Company completed\na registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement, issuing 1,159,211 shares of common stock and\n130,769 pre-funded warrants and series A warrants to purchase 1,289,980 shares of common stock and series B warrants\nto purchase 1,289,980 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $4.2 million. On May 18, 2023, the\nCompany completed a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement, issuing 601,851 shares of common\nstock, 731,482 pre-funded warrants, series C warrants to purchase 1,333,333 shares of common stock and series D\nwarrants to purchase 1,333,333 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $4.0 million. On\nNovember 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement and established an âAt-the-Marketâ offering (the\nâATM Programâ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through A.G.P/Alliance Global\nPartners, as sales agent, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the\nATM Program, the Company sold 698,121 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $2.6 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $7.5 million, which based on current\nestimates will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance of the\nF-7\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management believes that the Company will continue to\nincur losses for the foreseeable future and will need additional resources to sustain its operations until it can achieve\nprofitability and positive cash flows, if ever. Management plans to seek additional equity financing and grant funding,\nbut cannot assure that such financing and funding will be available at acceptable terms, or at all. These matters raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements\ndo not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that the\nCompanyâs research and development will be successfully completed or that any Company product candidate will be\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration (âFDAâ) or any other worldwide regulatory authority or become\ncommercially viable. The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biopharmaceutical industry\nincluding, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative arrangements, development by the Company or its\ncompetitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and\ncompliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements.\nNOTE 2 â SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company estimates an annual effective tax rate of 0% as the Company incurred net losses for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, resulting in an estimated net loss for both financial statement and tax purposes. Therefore,\nno current federal or state income tax expense has been recorded in the financial statements.\nBased on the Companyâs history of generating operating losses and its anticipation of operating losses for the\nforeseeable future, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits from those net\noperating losses would not be realized and a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets has been recorded.\nShould the Companyâs assessment change, tax benefits associated with the historic net operating loss carryforwards\ncould be limited due to future ownership changes.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains the majority of its cash balance in one financial institution. The balance is insured up to the\nmaximum allowable by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (âFDICâ). The Company has not experienced any\nlosses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant risk of loss on cash. At times, the cash\nbalance may exceed the maximum insured limit of the FDIC. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of\napproximately $7.5 million in U.S. bank accounts which was not fully insured by the FDIC.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. At times, the Company may make cash advances\nfor future research and development services. These amounts are deferred and expensed in the period the services are\nprovided. The Company incurred research and development expenses in the amount of $6,043,597 and $4,754,271, for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCosts for certain research and development activities, such as the provision of services for clinical trial activity, are\nestimated based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks which may use data such as subject\nenrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to the Company by its vendors with respect to their actual\ncosts incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ\nF-8\nfrom the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and\ndevelopment expense, as the case may be. The estimates are adjusted to reflect the best information available at the time\nof the financial statement issuance. Although the Company does not expect its estimates to be materially different from\namounts actually incurred, the Companyâs estimate of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual\nstatus and timing of services performed may vary.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for the cost of services performed by officers and directors received in exchange for an award of\nCompany membership interests, common stock or stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The\nCompany recognizes compensation expense based on the requisite service period.\nCompensation expense associated with stock option awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on the\nfair value of the option at the grant date determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option valuation\nmodels require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected price volatility. The Companyâs\nemployee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the\nsubjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value computation using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. Because there is no public market for the Companyâs stock options and very little historical experience with the\nCompanyâs stock, similar public companies were used for the comparison of volatility and the dividend yield. The risk-\nfree rate of return was derived from U.S. Treasury notes with comparable maturities.\nShare-Based Payments to Vendors\nThe Company accounts for the cost of services performed by vendors in exchange for an award of Company\nmembership interests, common stock, or stock options, based on the grant-date fair value of the award or the fair value\nof the services rendered; whichever is more readily determinable. The Company recognizes the expense in the same\nperiod and in the same manner as if the Company had paid cash for the services.\nMajor Vendor\nThe Company had a major vendor that accounted for approximately 63% and 55% of the research and development\nexpenditures for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The same vendor also accounted for\napproximately 53% and 56% of the total accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nNOTE 3 â ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nDe cember 31, 2023 D e cember 31, 2022\nAccrued compensation expenses $ 716,307 $ 542,895\nAccrued research and development 2,263,934 1,405,536\nAccrued professional fees 58,388 83,715\nOther accounts payable and accrued expenses 3,809 29,539\nTotal $ 3,042,438 $ 2,061,685\nF-9\nNOTE 4 â ISSUANCE OF EQUITY INTERESTS\nOn June 23, 2021, Acurx Pharmaceuticals, LLC was converted into a corporation and renamed Acurx\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. The Companyâs certificate of incorporation authorizes 200,000,000 shares of common stock, of\nwhich 14,468,229 were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nOn June 29, 2021, the Company completed an IPO issuing 2,875,000 shares of common stock at a price of $6.00 per\nshare, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $14.8 million, with cash issuance costs of approximately\n$2.4 million. The outstanding Class A and Class B Membership Interests were converted to shares of common stock\npursuant to a conversion ratio of one-for-two of the Membership Interests outstanding, resulting in the conversion of\n14,082,318 Class A and Class B Membership Interests into 7,041,208 shares of common stock. Warrants to purchase\nClass A Membership Interests were converted to warrants to purchase common stock at the same one-for two conversion\nratio, resulting in 1,437,577 warrants to purchase common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $2.88.\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company issued 150,000 warrants to the underwriter. Each warrant is exercisable for\n4.5 years from December 21, 2021 at an exercise price of $7.50 per share. The Company used the Black-Scholes model\nto calculate the value of the warrants with an estimated fair value of $618,000. The inputs utilized in the calculation were\nas follows: four and a half-year term, 0.79% risk-free rate, stock price at grant date of $6.26, and a 94% volatility\nutilizing comparable companies. This amount was recorded as both an increase to additional paid-in capital and as a non-\ncash issuance cost of the offering.\nOn July 25, 2022, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements (the âPurchase Agreementsâ) with two of\nthe Companyâs executives and a member of the Companyâs board of directors (collectively, the âAffiliate Investorsâ),\nand a single U.S. institutional investor (the âInvestorâ) pursuant to which the Company issued and sold in a registered\ndirect offering an aggregate of 1,159,211 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share and pre-funded warrants to\npurchase an aggregate of 130,769 shares of common stock. The Affiliate Investors purchased an aggregate of\n59,211 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $3.80 per share. The Investor purchased an aggregate of\n1,100,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $3.25 per share and an aggregate of 130,769 pre-funded\nwarrants at a purchase price of $3.2499 per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants sold to the Investor have an\nexercise price of $0.0001, were immediately exercisable. As of December 31, 2022, all of the pre-funded warrants were\nexercised. The Company also issued to the Affiliate Investors and the Investor, series A warrants to purchase\n1,289,980 shares of common stock and series B warrants to purchase 1,289,980 shares of common stock, all of which\nare deemed equity classified. These warrants included 59,211 series A warrants and an aggregate of 59,211 series B\nwarrants to the Affiliate Investors with an exercise price per share of $3.55 and an aggregate of 1,230,769 series A\nwarrants and an aggregate of 1,230,769 series B warrants to the Investor with an exercise price per share of $3.25. The\nseries A warrants were exercisable commencing on January 27, 2023 and will expire on May 18, 2029 for the Investor\nand January 27, 2028 for the Affiliates. The series B warrants were exercisable commencing on January 27, 2023 and\nwill expire on May 18, 2029 for the Investor and January 27, 2024 for the Affiliates. The registered direct offering\nclosed on July 27, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, 682,769 of series B warrants were exercised and the Company\nreceived approximately $2.2 million in proceeds from these warrant exercises.\nThe gross proceeds to the Company from the registered direct offering were $4.2 million and net proceeds after\ndeducting the placement agentsâ fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company were approximately\n$3.7 million.\nOn July 25, 2022, the Company entered into a co-placement agent agreement (the âPlacement Agent Agreementâ), with\ntwo placement agents in connection with the registered direct offering pursuant to which the Company paid the\nPlacement Agents a cash fee of $287,874 and issued to the Placement Agents an aggregate of 63,018 warrants to\npurchase shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $3.60 per share (representing 110% of the\nweighted average public offering price of the aggregate number of shares of common stock sold in the registered direct\noffering to the Investor and Affiliate Investors) and expire on July 27, 2027. The Company used the Black-Scholes\nmodel to calculate the value of the warrants with an estimated fair value of $171,409. The inputs utilized in the\ncalculation were as follows: five-year term, 2.82% risk free rate, stock price at grant date of $3.70 and a 95% volatility\nF-10\nutilizing comparable companies. This amount was recorded as both an increase to additional paid-in capital and as a\nnon-cash issuance cost of the offering.\nOn May 16, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single healthcare-focused U.S.\ninstitutional investor named therein (the â2023 Investorâ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold, in a\nregistered direct offering by the Company directly to the 2023 Investor (the â2023 Registered Offeringâ), an aggregate\nof 601,851 shares of common stock at an offering price of $3.00 per share and an aggregate of 731,482 pre-funded\nwarrants exercisable for shares of common stock at an offering price of $2.9999 per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded\nwarrants sold to the Investor have an exercise price of $0.0001 and were immediately exercisable. As of December 31,\n2023, all of the pre-funded warrants were exercised.\nThe gross proceeds to the Company from the registered direct offering were approximately $4.0 million and net\nproceeds after deducting the placements agentâs fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company were\napproximately $3.5 million.\nIn a concurrent private placement (the â2023 Private Placementâ and together with the 2023 Registered Offering, the\nâ2023 Offeringsâ), the Company issued to the Investor series C warrants exercisable for an aggregate of\n1,333,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.26 per share and series D warrants exercisable for an\naggregate of 1,333,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.26 per share. The Series C Warrants were\nexercisable commencing on November 18, 2023 and will expire on November 18, 2025. The Series D Warrants were\nexercisable commencing on November 18, 2023 and will expire on November 19, 2029.\nIn connection with the 2023 Offerings, the Company also entered into a Warrant Amendment Agreement with the 2023\nInvestor. Under the Warrant Amendment Agreement, the Company amended its existing series A warrants to purchase\nup to an aggregate of 1,230,769 shares of the Company's common stock and series B warrants to purchase up to an\naggregate of 1,230,769 shares of the Company's common stock (collectively, the âExisting Warrantsâ) that were\npreviously issued in July 2022, such that effective upon the closing of the offering, the amended Existing Warrants have\na termination date of May 18, 2029. The Company used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the change in the value of\nthe aforementioned series A and series B warrants attributable to the change in the termination date, with an estimated\nincrease in fair value of approximately $2.0 million. This amount was recorded as both an increase to additional paid-in\ncapital and as a non-cash issuance cost of the offerings.\nOn November 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement and established the ATM Program, pursuant to\nwhich the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, as sales agent,\nshares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.0 million. Under the sales agreement, the\nsales agent is entitled to compensation of 3% of the gross offering proceeds of all shares sold through it pursuant to the\nSales Agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 698,121 shares of its common stock under the ATM\nProgram at a weighted-average price of $3.76 per share, raising $2.6 million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of\n$2.4 million, after deducting commissions to the sales agent and other ATM Program related expenses. The Company\nrecorded a receivable of $129,159 for 34,116 shares sold under the ATM Program yet to settle as of December 31, 2023,\nof which 17,869 shares had yet to be issued by the transfer agent as of year-end. The receivable for the unsettled shares\nas of December 31, 2023 is included within the âOther Receivableâ balance in the accompanying balance sheets. The\nreceivables were collected on January 3, 2024 and 17,869 shares were settled and transferred on January 2, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has $14.4 million available under the ATM Program.\nF-11\nThe following table summarizes information with respect to outstanding warrants to purchase common stock of the\nCompany at December 31, 2023:\nWeighted Average\nNumber of Warrants Exercise Price\nBalance at December 31, 2022 4,217,809 $ 3.29\nIssued 3,398,148 2.56\nExercised (1,420,501) 1.57\nBalance at December 31, 2023 6,195,456 $ 3.28\nThe weighted average contractual life of the outstanding warrants is 4.46 years.\nNOTE 5 â SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn April 2021, the board of directors approved the creation of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the âPlanâ). The Plan\nbecame effective as of the completion of the corporate conversion.

The purpose of the Plan is to attract, retain and incentivize directors, officers, employees, and consultants.\nIn June 2021, the Company granted stock options to purchase a total of 807,500 shares of common stock to its three\nexecutives and three non-employee management team members to replace the Class B Membership Interests that were\ncancelled in March 2021.

The Company recorded general\nand administrative expenses of $53,600 for the year ended December 31, 2023, related to compensation expenses for\nthese options.\nCompensation expense associated with these awards is recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of the\noption at the grant date determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option valuation models require\nthe input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected price volatility. The Companyâs employee stock\noptions have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input\nassumptions can materially affect the fair value computation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Because\nthere is no public market for the Companyâs stock options and very little historical experience with the Companyâs\nstock, similar public companies were used for the comparison of volatility and the dividend yield. The risk-free rate of\nreturn was derived from U.S. Treasury notes with comparable maturities.\nThe Company determined the fair value of the option awards during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, using\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions:\nYe ars En de d\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nExpected term 6.9 years 9.0 years\nVolatility 98 % 90 %\nDividend yield â % â %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.85 % 2.01 %\nWeighted average grant date fair value $ 2.75 $ 3.54\nA summary of the Companyâs stock option activity is as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage\nWeighted Remaining Aggregate\nNumber of Average Contractual Term Intrinsic\nOptions Exercise Price (in years) Value\nOutstanding, vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2022 2,467,500 $ 6.12 8.53 $ 5,700\nGranted 517,500 3.35 9.16\nExercised â â â\nForfeited â â â\nOutstanding, vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023 2,985,000 $ 5.64 7.81 $ 251,550\nExercisable 2,280,361 $ 5.98 7.61 $ 55,342\nThe total compensation expense not yet recognized as of December 31, 2023 was $2,458,851. The weighted average\nvesting period for the unvested options is 1.30 years. The weighted average grant date fair value of all options granted is\n$4.33 as of December 31, 2023. The Company records the impact of any forfeitures of options as they occur.\nNOTE 6 â SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO VENDORS\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with a consultant to provide financial advisory\nservices for a six-month term.

The cash payments are expensed over\nthe service period and the equity components are expensed consistent with the various contractual vesting periods. The\nCompany recorded general and administrative expenses of $393,681 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNOTE 7 â INCOME TAXES\nThe Company has $17.6 million of net operating loss carryforwards and $0.3 million of research tax credit carryforwards\nas of December 31, 2023. The net operating loss carryforwards are indefinite lived and research tax credit carryforwards\nwill expire in 2043. Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to annual limitations in the\nevent of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in\nexcess of 50%, as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as similar state provisions. This\ncould limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities.\nF-14\nThe components of the net deferred income tax asset at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nDe cember 31, 2023 De cember 31, 2022\nDeferred tax assets\nNet operating loss carry forwards $ 5,517,038 $ 3,359,183\nShare-based compensation 3,255,964 2,262,381\nResearch and development credit carryforwards 331,671 141,671\nCapitalized research and development 2,807,846 1,347,028\nOther 10,945 â\nGross deferred tax assets 11,923,464 7,110,263\nLess valuation allowance (11,923,464) (7,110,263)\nNet deferred tax asset $ â $ â\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) amended IRC Section 174 to require capitalization of all research and\ndevelopmental (R&D) costs incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. These costs are required to be\namortized over five years if the R&D activities are performed in the U.S., or over 15 years if the activities were\nperformed outside the U.S. The Company capitalized approximately $6.1 million and $4.8 million of R&D expenses for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some\nportion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent\nupon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences representing net\nfuture deductible amounts become deductible. After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, the\nCompany has recorded a full valuation allowance against their net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023 because the\nCompany has concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that these assets will not be realized.\nA reconciliation of income tax expense (benefit) at the statutory Federal income tax rate and income taxes as reflected in\nthe financial statements for both years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFederal income tax expense at statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income tax, net of federal benefit 10.4 14.4\nPermanent differences 1.6 (0.5)\nResearch and development tax credit â 0.3\nChange in valuation allowance (33.0) (35.2)\nEffective income tax rate â % â %\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and the State of New York. The tax years 2021 and thereafter are open\nand potentially subject to examination by the federal and state taxing authorities. The Company is currently not under\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (âIRSâ) or any other jurisdictions for any tax years and has no knowledge\nof any pending examinations by the IRS or any other jurisdictions. To the extent the Company utilizes any tax attributes\nfrom a tax period that may otherwise be closed due to statute expiration, the IRS, state tax authorities, or other governing\nparties may still adjust the tax attributes upon their examination of the future period in which the attribute was utilized.\nThere are no uncertain tax positions recorded for any federal or state positions at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The\nCompanyâs policy is to record interest and penalties related to tax matters in income tax expense.\nF-15\nNOTE 8 â NET LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted net loss per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was determined\nby dividing net loss by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Companyâs\npotentially dilutive securities, consisting of 6,195,456 warrants, and 2,985,000 stock options, have not been included in\nthe computation of diluted net loss per share for all periods as the result would be antidilutive.\nNOTE 9 â COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nIn conjunction with the Asset purchase in February 2018, the Company is required to make certain milestone payments\nrelated to the ongoing development of ACX-362E totaling $700,000 in the aggregate if certain milestones are achieved\n(which includes $50,000 already paid after the acquisition in February 2018). During the fourth quarter of 2023, the\nCompany achieved the Phase 2 clinical trial milestone and included $150,000 as a part of accounts payable and accrued\nexpenses as of December 31, 2023. The Company is also obligated to make royalty payments equal to 4% of net sales\nof ACX-362E for a period of time equal to the last to expire of any applicable patents, as defined in the purchase\nagreement.\nNOTE 10 â SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nAs a part of the ATM Program, the Company sold a total of 1,819,914 shares of its common stock pursuant to the Sales\nAgreement at an average price of $3.88 for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $6.7 million as of March 15, 2024.\nF-16\nExhibit 21.1\nSUBSIDIARIES OF THE REGISTRANT\nNone.\nExhibit 23.1\nCONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements on Form S-1 (333-267412 and 333-\n273015), Form S-3 (333-265956) and Form S-8 (333-258026, 333-263609 and 333-270585) of our report, dated\nMarch 15, 2024, with respect to the financial statements of Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. included in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K of Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023.
