We are very pleased to have received IND clearance for DYNE-101 and plan to report in early January additional data from the ACHIEVE trial in DM1, including from the 6.8 mg/kg cohort, which will inform our go-forward dose and dose regimen. Based on the encouraging biomarker and functional data from the DELIVER trial of DYNE-251 in DMD, we are enrolling patients in a registrational cohort at 20 mg/kg. We continue to pursue expedited approval pathways for both DYNE-101 and DYNE-251,” said John Cox, president and chief executive officer of Dyne. “Our strong financial foundation positions us to advance our clinical programs as well as our pipeline to address the significant unmet needs of people living with neuromuscular diseases.”\n\n**ACHIEVE Trial of DYNE-101 in DM1**\n\n  * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for DYNE-101, which is being evaluated in the ongoing, global Phase 1/2 ACHIEVE trial in adults with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The ACHIEVE trial currently includes 56 participants and is fully enrolled through the 6.8 mg/kg Q8W cohort (approximate ASO dose). \n  * Dyne anticipates reporting in early January 2025 new data from the ACHIEVE trial, including safety and tolerability, change from baseline in splicing, video hand opening time (vHOT) assessment, functional measures, as well as patient-reported outcomes. \n    * Efficacy data will be shared from the 6.8 mg/kg cohort up to 6 months and the 5.4 mg/kg and 3.4 mg/kg cohorts up to 12 months.\n    * Longer-term safety and tolerability data from all participants will be reported.\n  * Dyne continues to pursue expedited approval pathways globally for DYNE-101 utilizing splicing as a surrogate endpoint.\n\n\n\n**DELIVER Trial of DYNE-251 in DMD**\n\n  * In September 2024, Dyne reported positive efficacy data and a favorable safety profile1 from the ongoing Phase 1/2 global DELIVER trial of DYNE-251 in males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. Based on these data, Dyne has begun enrolling a 20 mg/kg Q4W (approximate PMO dose) registrational cohort of 32 participants as part of the DELIVER trial. The Company continues to pursue expedited approval pathways for DYNE-251, including accelerated approval in the U.S. based on dystrophin as a surrogate endpoint.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash position:** Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $723.7 million as of September 30, 2024, which is anticipated to fund operations at least into the second half of 2026.\n\n**Research and development (R &D) expenses: **R&D expenses were $92.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $55.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**General and administrative (G &A) expenses: **G&A expenses were $12.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $7.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Net loss:** Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $97.1 million, or $0.96 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a net loss of $60.2 million, or $0.99 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**About Dyne Therapeutics**\n\nDyne Therapeutics is a clinical-stage muscle disease company focused on advancing innovative life-transforming therapeutics for people living with genetically driven diseases.
