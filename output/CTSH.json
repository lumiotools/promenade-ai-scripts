Digital services continue to be an important part of our portfolio, aligning with our clients' focus on\nbecoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses.\nOur purpose, vision and values are central to Cognizant's strategic approach.\nIn order to achieve this vision and support our clients, we are focusing our business on six strategic initiatives to simplify\nour operations, become an employer of choice and accelerate growth. These strategic initiatives include:\n• Growing in select industries - investing in prioritized industries to drive differentiation across our value chain;\n• Expanding internationally - growing by prioritizing strategic growth accounts;\n• Building large deal capabilities - enhancing creative deal generation with the right solutions, deal modeling\nand governance;\n• Capturing the AI opportunity - protecting and expanding in target areas while improving efficiency;\n• Delivering our talent strategy - embedding our cultural values and building a future-relevant talent model; and\n• Continuing to implement our IT roadmap – continuing to modernize and execute critical projects necessary to\nlead with AI.\nWe seek to drive organic growth through investments in our digital capabilities across industries and geographies,\nincluding the extensive training and reskilling of our technical teams and the expansion of our local workforces in the United\nStates and other markets around the world. Additionally, we pursue select strategic acquisitions that can expand our talent,\nexperience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries. In 2023, we completed two such\nacquisitions to complement the nine acquisitions we completed during 2021 and 2022. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial\nstatements for additional information.\nResponsible operations and transparency around environmental and social efforts are important to our stakeholders, which\nis why our ESG program is designed to align with our clients’ and employees’ focus on ESG-related topics in our value chain,\nincluding but not limited to, our supply chain, delivery and solutions.\nCognizant 5 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nReportable Business Segments\nWe go to market across seven industry-based operating segments, which are aggregated into four reportable business\nsegments:\n• Financial Services (FS)\n◦ Banking\n◦ Insurance\n• Health Sciences (HS) - This reportable business segment is comprised of a single operating segment of the\nsame name.\n• Products and Resources (P&R)\n◦ Retail and Consumer Goods\n◦ Manufacturing, Logistics, Energy and Utilities\n◦ Travel and Hospitality\n• Communications, Media and Technology (CMT) - This reportable business segment is comprised of a\nsingle operating segment of the same name.\nOur clients seek to partner with service providers that have a deep understanding of their businesses, industry initiatives,\ncustomers, markets and cultures and the ability to create solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs. Across\nindustries, our clients are confronted with the risk of being disrupted by nimble, digital-native competitors. They are therefore\nredirecting their focus and investment to digital operating models and embracing DevOps and key technologies that enable\nquick adjustments to shifts in their markets. We believe that our deep knowledge of the industries we serve and our clients’\nbusinesses has been central to our growth and high client satisfaction, and we continue to develop and deploy our client-centric\nculture, innovating together to produce transformative outcomes.\nOur FS segment includes banking, capital markets, payments and insurance companies. Demand in this segment is driven\nby our clients’ need to adopt and integrate digital technologies to serve their customers while complying with significant\nregulatory requirements and adapting to regulatory change. These digital technologies enable enhanced customer experience,\nrobotic process automation, analytics and AI in areas such as digital lending, fraud detection and next generation payments. In\naddition to having platforms that drive outcomes at speed, demand is also created by our clients’ desire to reduce complexity\nthrough packaged solutions and suppliers with embedded product partners.\nOur HS segment consists of healthcare providers and payers, and life sciences companies, including pharmaceutical,\nbiotech and medical device companies. Demand in this segment is driven by emerging industry trends, including the shift\ntowards consumerism, outcome-based contracting, digital health and delivering integrated seamless, omni-channel, patient-\ncentered experiences. These trends result in increased demand for services that drive operational improvements in areas such as\nclinical development, pharmacovigilance and manufacturing, as well as claims processing, enrollment, membership and billing.\nDemand is also created by the adoption and integration of digital technologies such as AI to shape personalized care plans and\npredictive data analytics to improve clinical trial designs, patient engagement and care outcomes.\nOur P&R segment includes manufacturers, automakers, retailers and travel and hospitality companies, as well as\ncompanies providing logistics, energy and utility services. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ focus on improving\nthe efficiency and sustainability of their operations; the enablement and integration of mobile platforms to support sales and\nother omni-channel commerce initiatives; the generational shift from mechanical to software-defined, experience-driven\nvehicles; grid modernization to prepare for a decarbonized and consumer-driven energy landscape; and their adoption and\nintegration of digital technologies, such as the application of intelligent systems to manage supply chains and enhance overall\ncustomer experiences, and IoT to instrument functions for factories, real estate, fleets and products to increase access to insight-\ngenerating data.\nOur CMT segment includes global communications, media and entertainment, education, information services and\ntechnology companies. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ need for services related to digital content, business\nprocess improvement, technology modernization, the creation of unified and compelling user experiences and identifying new\nrevenue streams to drive growth. In response to this demand, we are focusing on services and solutions in the areas of\nmonetization and evolution of networks, media supply chain transformation, product engineering and verticalization as well as\ndata modernization and customer experience design.\nCognizant 6 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the distribution of our revenues across our four reportable business segments was\nas follows:\nRevenues by business segment for 2023\nHealth Sciences: 29.3%\nFinancial Services: 30.0%\nCommunications,\nMedia and Products and\nTechnology: 16.8% Resources: 23.9%\nThe services we provide are distributed among a number of clients in each of our reportable business segments. A loss of\na significant client or a few significant clients in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment. The\nservices we provide to our larger clients are often critical to their operations and a termination of our services would typically\nrequire an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues. Nevertheless, the volume of work performed for\nspecific clients may vary significantly from year to year.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to disaggregation of revenues by\nclient location, service line and contract-type for each of our reportable business segments.\nServices and Solutions\nOur services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, quality\nengineering and assurance, application maintenance, infrastructure and security as well as business process services and\nautomation. Additionally, we develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products and\nplatforms. Central to our strategy to align with our clients’ need to modernize is our continued investment in new technologies,\nincluding AI, cloud, data modernization, automation, digital engineering and IoT. These four capabilities enable clients to put\ndata at the core of their operations, improve the experiences they offer to their customers, tap into new revenue streams,\nautomate operations, defend against technology-enabled competitors and reduce costs. In many cases, our clients' new digital\nsystems are built on the backbone of their existing legacy systems, which can increase complexity and impact business\ncontinuity. In the post-pandemic environment, our clients have a sustained need to modernize their businesses, which has led to\nincreased demand for digital capabilities such as mobile workplace solutions, e-commerce, automation, AI and cybersecurity\nservices and solutions. We believe our deep knowledge of our clients' infrastructure and systems provides us with a significant\nadvantage as we work with them to build new digital capabilities to make their operations more modern and intuitive. We\ndeliver all our services and solutions across our four reportable business segments to best address our clients' individual needs.\nOur services and solutions are organized into five integrated practices, which help us better serve our clients through\nintegrated solutioning and delivery.

Our clients can harness data securely in cloud-first\narchitectures, enabling them to become highly resilient enterprises that are capable of quickly adapting to market dynamics.\nAreas of focus within this practice are:\n• Cloud, infrastructure and security, which helps simplify, modernize and safeguard IT environments, creating new\nbusiness opportunities;\n• AI and analytics, which helps clients formulate actionable insights from unstructured data to drive a greater\nunderstanding of their customers and operations; and\n• IoT, which unlocks greater insights and new business models.\nCognizant 7 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nEnterprise Platform Services\nOur Enterprise Platform Services practice helps our clients digitally transform multiple front- and back-office business\nprocesses, implementing enterprise-wide platforms that enable customer experience, customer relationship management, human\ncapital management, supply chain management, enterprise resource planning and finance.

Our delivery model includes employees deployed at client sites, local or in-country delivery centers, regional\ndelivery centers and offshore delivery centers, as required to best serve our clients. As we continue to scale our digital services\nand solutions, we are focused on hiring in the United States and other countries where we deliver services to our clients to\nexpand our in-country delivery capabilities. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure are\ndesigned to enable the effective collaboration of our global workforce across locations and geographies.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive, characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid\nchange. Competitors may include systems integration firms, contract programming companies, application software companies,\ncloud computing service providers, traditional consulting firms, professional services groups of computer equipment\ncompanies, infrastructure management companies, outsourcing companies and boutique digital companies. Our direct\ncompetitors include, among others, Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, EPAM Systems, Genpact,\nHCL Technologies, IBM Consulting, Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro.

We recognize the importance of IP and its ability to differentiate us from our\ncompetitors. We seek IP protection for many of our innovations and rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trade secret\nlaws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our IP. We have registered, and applied for the\nregistration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, and domain names to protect our brands, including our\nCognizant brand, which is one of our most valuable assets. We own or are licensed under a number of patents, trademarks and\ncopyrights of varying duration, relating to our products and services. We also have policies requiring our employees to respect\nthe IP rights of others. While our proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not\nmaterially dependent on any particular IP right or any particular group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses, other than\nour Cognizant brand.\nCognizant® and other trademarks appearing in this report are registered trademarks or trademarks of Cognizant and its\naffiliates in the United States and other countries, or third parties, as applicable.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes trademarks and service marks owned by us.

We utilize subcontractors to provide additional\ncapacity and flexibility in meeting client demand, though the number of subcontractors has historically been immaterial relative\nto our employee headcount.

We aim to be the employer of choice in our industry and\nfor our employees to feel motivated, engaged, and empowered to do their best work through careers they find meaningful.\n• Engagement & Retention: In a market where competition for skilled IT professionals is intense, we routinely focus\non listening to, engaging with and investing in our people through a comprehensive talent approach.\nHighlights include:\n– We maintain and regularly enhance our employee value proposition (the benefits and experiences we offer our\nassociates) as the strategic guide for our people programs, including our recruitment, talent management and\nemployee engagement efforts;\n– We monitor engagement levels and assess employee sentiment through a third-party engagement survey. In\n2023, we saw meaningful increases in our employee engagement scores;\n– On an annual basis, after each engagement survey, we develop action plans designed to continue to build on\nour strengths and address shortfalls. People managers are also asked to assess their scores and build actions\nplans for their teams; and\n– We regularly assess retention levels. Despite continued competition for skilled employees in the technology\nindustry, Cognizant experienced meaningfully lower attrition in 2023 compared to the prior year. We closely\nmonitor attrition trends focusing on the metric that we believe is most relevant to our business. This metric,\nwhich we refer to as Voluntary Attrition - Tech Services, includes all voluntary separations with the exception\nof employees in our Intuitive Operations and Automation practice.

Risk Factors\nWe face various important risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition and, as a result, cause a decline in the trading price of our common\nstock.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions globally and in\nparticular in the markets in which our clients and operations are concentrated.\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions have a significant effect on our business as well as the businesses of our clients.\nVolatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions have in the past and could in the future cause our clients to reduce,\npostpone or cancel spending on projects with us, making it more difficult for us to accurately forecast client demand and have\navailable the right resources to profitably address such client demand. For example, in 2023 some of our clients reduced their\ndiscretionary spending in response to economic uncertainty, which negatively impacted our revenues. Clients may reduce\ndemand for services quickly and with little warning, which may cause us to incur extra costs where we have employed more\npersonnel than client demand supports.\nOur business is particularly susceptible to economic and political conditions in the markets where our clients or operations\nare concentrated. Our revenues are highly dependent on clients located in the United States and Europe, and any adverse\neconomic, political or legal uncertainties or adverse developments, including due to the uncertainty related to the economic\nenvironment and inflation, may cause clients in these geographies to reduce their spending and materially adversely impact our\nbusiness. Many of our clients are in the financial services and healthcare industries, so any decrease in growth or significant\nconsolidation in these industries or regulatory policies that restrict these industries may reduce demand for our services.\nEconomic and political developments in India, where a significant majority of our operations and technical personnel are\nlocated, or in other countries where we maintain delivery operations, may also have a significant impact on our business and\ncosts of operations. As a developing country, India has experienced and may continue to experience high inflation and wage\ngrowth, fluctuations in gross domestic product growth and volatility in currency exchange rates, any of which could materially\nadversely affect our cost of operations. Additionally, we benefit from governmental policies in countries that encourage foreign\ninvestment and promote the ease of doing business, such as tax incentives, and any change in policy or circumstances that\nresults in the elimination of such benefits or degradation of the rule of law, or imposition of new adverse restrictions or costs on\nour operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain skilled employees to satisfy client demand, including highly skilled\ntechnical personnel and personnel with experience in key digital areas, as well as senior management to lead our\nbusiness globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees, including project\nmanagers, IT engineers and senior technical personnel, in particular those with experience in key digital areas, in balance with\nclient demand around the world and on our ability to attract and retain senior management with the knowledge and skills to lead\nour business globally. In 2021 and most of 2022, we, and we believe the IT industry as a whole, experienced unprecedented\nattrition. As a result, we hired over a hundred thousand new employees in each of 2021 and 2022, and over sixty thousand in\n2023. Correspondingly, we have needed to reskill, retain, integrate and motivate our large workforce with diverse skills and\nexpertise in order to serve client demands across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technological, industry and\nmacroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business. The rate of attrition began to decrease in the second half of\n2022, but if such attrition levels increase again in the future, it could materially adversely affect our business and results of\noperations. We also must continue to maintain a senior leadership team that, among other things, is effective in executing on\nour strategic goals and growing our digital business. The loss of senior executives, or the failure to attract, integrate and retain\nnew senior executives as the needs of our business require, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nCompetition for skilled labor is intense and, in some jurisdictions in which we operate and in key digital areas, there are\nmore open positions than qualified persons to fill these positions. We compete for employees not only with other companies in\nour industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services\ncompanies. Our business has experienced in the past and may experience in the future significant employee attrition, which has\ncaused us to incur increased costs to hire new employees with the desired skills. While we strive to adjust pricing to reduce the\nimpact of compensation increases on our operating margin, we may not be successful in recovering these increases, which\ncould adversely affect our profitability and operating margin. Costs associated with recruiting and training employees are\nCognizant 14 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nsignificant. If we are unable to hire or deploy employees with the needed skillsets or if we are unable to adequately equip our\nemployees with the skills needed, this could materially adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to offer our employees a value proposition that is competitive and appealing, it could have\nan adverse effect on engagement and retention, which may materially adversely affect our business.\nMany of our contracts with clients are short-term, and our business, results of operations and financial condition\ncould be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts on short notice.\nConsistent with industry practice, many of our contracts with clients are short-term or can be terminated by our clients\nwith short notice and without significant early termination cost. Even if not terminated, clients may be able to delay, reduce or\neliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide, choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to\nrenegotiate the terms of a contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. Terminations and such other events may result\nfrom factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project, including the business,\nfinancial or labor conditions of a client, changes in ownership, management or the strategy of a client or economic or market\nconditions generally or specific to a client’s industry. When contracts are terminated or spending delayed, we lose the\nanticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner. In particular, the loss of a\nsignificant client or a few significant clients could materially reduce revenues for the Company as a whole or for a particular\nbusiness segment. In addition, our operating margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected. If we are unable to\nreplace the lost revenues with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs, our business, results of\noperations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe face challenges related to growing our business organically as well as inorganically through acquisitions, and\nwe may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates.\nAchievement of our targeted growth rates requires continued significant organic growth of our business as well as\ninorganic growth through acquisitions. To achieve such growth, we must, among other things, continue to significantly expand\nour global operations, in particular with respect to digital, and scale our infrastructure to support such business growth and\nensure that our service offerings remain responsive to market demand. Continued business growth increases the complexity of\nour business and places significant strain on our management, employees, operations, systems, delivery, financial resources,\nand internal financial control and reporting functions, which we will have to continue to develop and improve to sustain such\ngrowth. Our ability to successfully manage change associated with the various business transformation initiatives is critical for\nthe overall strategy execution. We must continually recruit and train new employees, retain and reskill, as necessary, existing\nsales, technical, finance, marketing and management employees with the knowledge, skills and experience that our business\nmodel requires and effectively manage our employees worldwide to support our culture, values, strategies and goals.\nAdditionally, we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and investments to enhance our offerings\nof services and solutions or to enable us to expand our talent, experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular\ngeographies or industries. We may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities, completing targeted transactions or\nachieving the desired results in the timeframe we expect or at all, such opportunities may divert our management's time and\nfocus away from our core business and realizing the desired results of a particular transaction may depend upon competition,\nmarket trends, regulatory developments, additional costs or investments and the actions of suppliers or other third parties. We\nmay face challenges in effectively integrating acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and in assimilating and retaining\nemployees of those businesses into our culture and organizational structure, and these risks may be magnified by the size and\nnumber of transactions we execute.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, complete acquisitions of the number, magnitude and nature we have\ntargeted, or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our targeted\ngrowth rates or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position generally or in specific markets or services.\nOur NextGen program and the associated reductions in headcount and consolidation of office space could disrupt\nour business, may not result in anticipated savings, and could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than\nexpected.\nGuided by our strategic priorities, in the second quarter of 2023 we initiated the NextGen program aimed at simplifying\nour operating model, optimizing corporate functions and consolidating and realigning office space to reflect the post-pandemic\nhybrid work environment. Our drive for simplification will include operating with fewer layers in an effort to enhance agility\nand enable faster decision making.\nIn connection with the NextGen program, in 2023 we incurred $115 million of employee separation costs and $114\nmillion of facility exit and other costs totaling $229 million. See Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements. We\nCognizant 15 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\ncurrently expect to incur total costs of approximately $300 million with approximately $70 million of such costs anticipated in\n2024. The NextGen program may result in the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, as well as the reallocation of\ncertain roles and responsibilities across the Company, all of which could adversely affect our operations. Such effects from our\nNextGen program could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute on our business plan. There can be no\nassurance that we will be successful in implementing our NextGen program, which may be disruptive to our operations, or may\ncause difficulties in the retention of our remaining employees or reduced productivity among remaining employees. In addition,\nwe may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our cost structure from the NextGen\nprogram due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If the actual amount and timing of costs differ from our\ncurrent expectations and estimates or we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from the\nNextGen program, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may incur\nunanticipated charges or be required to make cash payments as a result of our NextGen program that were not previously\ncontemplated, which could result in an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to achieve our profitability goals and maintain our capital return strategy.\nOur goals for profitability and capital return rely upon a number of assumptions, including our ability to improve the\nefficiency of our operations and make successful investments to grow and further develop our business. Our profitability is\nimpacted by our ability to accurately estimate, attain, and sustain revenues from client engagements, margins and cash flows\nover contract periods and general economic and political conditions. Our profitability also depends on the efficiency with which\nwe run our operations (including changes in our internal organizational structure) and the cost of our operations, especially the\ncompensation and benefits costs of our employees. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs related to\nimplementing our strategy to optimize such costs, and we may not realize the ultimate cost savings that we expect. We may not\nbe able to efficiently utilize our employees if increased regulation, policy changes or administrative burdens of immigration,\nwork visas or client worksite placement prevents us from deploying our employees on a timely basis, or at all, to fulfill the\nneeds of our clients. Our utilization rates are further affected by a number of factors, including our ability to transition\nemployees from completed projects to new assignments, hire and assimilate new employees, forecast demand for our services\nand thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforce and manage attrition, and our need to\ndevote time and resources to training, professional development and other typically non-chargeable activities. Increases in\nwages and other costs, including as a result of attrition, may also put pressure on our profitability.\nWith respect to capital return, our ability and decisions to pay dividends and repurchase shares depend on a variety of\nfactors, including the cash flow generated from operations, our cash and investment balances, our net income, our overall\nliquidity position, potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, and anticipated future economic conditions and\nfinancial results. Failure to carry out our capital return strategy may adversely impact our reputation with shareholders and\nshareholders’ perception of our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or the failure of our hedging strategies to mitigate such\nfluctuations, can adversely impact our profitability, results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can also have adverse effects on our revenues, income from operations\nand net income when items denominated in other currencies are translated or remeasured into U.S. dollars for presentation of\nour consolidated financial statements. We have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to partially offset the\nimpact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs and to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign\ncurrency denominated net monetary assets. However, the hedging strategies that we have implemented, or may in the future\nimplement, to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign\nexchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market, operational and counterparty credit risks. We are\nparticularly susceptible to wage and cost pressures in India and the exchange rate of the Indian rupee relative to the currencies\nof our client contracts due to the fact that the substantial majority of our employees are in India while our contracts with clients\nare typically in the local currency of the country where our clients are located.\nOur failure to meet specified service levels or milestones required by certain of our client contracts may result in\nour client contracts being less profitable, potential liability for penalties or damages or reputational harm.\nMany of our client contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance\nstandards or milestones. Failure to satisfy these requirements could significantly reduce our fees under the contracts, increase\nthe cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments, subject us to potential damage claims\nunder the contract terms or harm our reputation. The use of new technologies in our offerings (including GenAI) can expose us\nto additional risks if those technologies fail to work as predicted, which could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial\npenalties, or damage to our reputation. Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damages claims for\nserious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments. Some of our contracts provide that a portion of our\ncompensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals\nCognizant 16 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nattained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business\nactivity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate. As such, these provisions\nmay increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts and have in the past resulted, and could in the\nfuture result, in significant losses on such contracts. Further, if we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for\nmeeting our contractual commitments or completing engagements to a client's satisfaction, our contracts could have delivery\ninefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable.\nWe face intense and evolving competition and our service offerings must keep pace with significant technological\nadvances in the rapidly changing markets we compete in.\nThe markets we serve and operate in are highly competitive, subject to rapid change and characterized by a large number\nof participants, as described in “Part I, Item 1. Business-Competition.” We compete on the basis of reputation and experience,\nstrategic advisory capabilities, digital services capabilities, performance and reliability, responsiveness to customer needs,\nfinancial stability, corporate governance and competitive pricing of services. The less we are able to differentiate our services\nand solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more difficulty we have in winning new work in\nsufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics. In addition to large, global competitors, we face competition\nin many geographic markets from numerous smaller, local competitors that may have more experience with operations in these\nmarkets, have well-established relationships with our desired clients, or be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs\nor on terms more attractive to clients than we can. Consolidation activity may also result in new competitors with greater scale,\na broader footprint or vertical integration that makes them more attractive to clients as a single provider of integrated products\nand services. In addition, concurrent use by many clients of multiple professional service providers means that we are required\nto be continually competitive on the quality, scope and pricing of our offerings or face a reduction or elimination of our\nbusiness. Competitors may also be willing, at times, to take on more risk or price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter\nthe market or increase market share. If we are not able to supply clients with services that they deem superior and successfully\napply current business models with market level pricing while managing discounts, we may lose business to competitors and\nface downward pressure on gross margins and profitability. Any inability to compete effectively would materially adversely\naffect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur relationships with our third-party alliance partners, who supply us with necessary components to the services and\nsolutions we offer our clients, are also critical to our ability to provide many of our services and solutions that address client\ndemands. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such relationships or that such components will be\navailable on the expected timelines or for anticipated prices. Among other things, such alliance partners may in the future\ndecide to compete with us, form exclusive or more favorable arrangements with our competitors or otherwise reduce our access\nto their products, thereby impairing our ability to provide the services and solutions demanded by clients. Any performance\nfailure on the part of our alliance partners, or the discontinuance by such alliance partners of services that we have relied on\nthem to perform for our clients, could delay our performance or require us to engage alternative third parties to perform the\nservices at our cost or to perform them ourselves, any of which could deprive us of potential revenue or adversely impact our\nprofitability.\nOur competitiveness also depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that\nanticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of\nareas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as\ndevelopments in areas such as AI, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, IoT, quantum computing and as-a-service\nsolutions, among others. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies, successfully adapt to industry developments and\nchanging demand, and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the demands of the\nmarkets we serve, we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and execute on our growth strategy,\nwhich would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our clients may\ndelay spending under existing contracts and engagements or delay entering into new contracts while evaluating new\ntechnologies. Such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to adapt our pricing or the pace and\nlevel of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall. Further, as we expand into these areas, we may\nbe exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may\nnegatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.\nOur use of AI technologies may not be successful and may present business, financial, legal, and reputational risks.\nWe increasingly use AI-based technologies, including GenAI, in our client offerings and our own internal operations. As\nwith many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could adversely impact our business.\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies are still in their early stages and ineffective or inadequate AI\ndevelopment or deployment practices by us, our clients, or third parties with whom we do business could result in unintended\nCognizant 17 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nconsequences. Such consequences may include, for example, employees making decisions based on biased or inaccurate\ninformation; disclosure of sensitive information; deliberate misuse; or infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. In\nturn, these consequences may cause decreased demand for our services or harm to our business, results of operations, or\nreputation.\nAI technology and services are part of a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We plan to incur significant\ndevelopment and operational costs to build and support our AI capabilities to meet the needs of our clients. We face significant\ncompetition from our traditional competitors as well as other third parties, including those that are new to the market, and our\nclients may develop their own AI-related capabilities. In addition, as these technologies evolve, we expect that some services\nthat we currently perform for our clients will be replaced by AI or forms of automation. Each of the foregoing may lead to\nreduced demand for our services or harm our ability to obtain favorable pricing or other terms for our services, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain including\nin the areas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. Compliance with new or changing laws,\nregulations, industry standards or ethical requirements and expectations relating to AI may impose significant operational costs\nrequiring us to change our service offerings or business practices, or may limit or prevent our ability to develop, deploy, or use\nAI technologies. Failure to appropriately conform to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or\nbrand and reputational harm.\nWe face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Cognizant data from security\nbreaches and/or cyberattacks.\nIn order to provide our services and solutions, we depend on global information technology networks and systems, to\nprocess, transmit, host and securely store electronic information (including our confidential information and the confidential\ninformation of our clients) and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, suppliers and\nalliance partners (including numerous cloud service providers). Security breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or\ntechnological error create risks of shutdowns or disruptions of our operations and potential unauthorized access and/or\ndisclosure of our or our clients’ sensitive data, which in turn could jeopardize projects that are critical to our operations or the\noperations of our clients’ businesses and have other adverse impacts on our business or the business of our clients.\nIn addition, the products, services and software that we provide to our clients, or the third-party components we use to\nprovide such products, services and software, may unintentionally contain or introduce cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities\nto our clients’ information technology networks. Our clients may maintain their own proprietary, sensitive, or confidential\ninformation that could be compromised in a cybersecurity attack, or their systems may be disabled or disrupted as a result of\nsuch an attack. Our clients, regulators, or other third parties may attempt to hold us liable for any such losses or damages\nresulting from such an attack, including through contractual indemnification clauses.\nLike other global companies, we and our clients, suppliers, alliance partners (including numerous cloud service providers)\nand other vendors we interact with face threats to data and systems, including by nation state threat actors, insider threats\n(including inappropriate access), perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, malware, worms,\nbot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate client information and cause system\nfailures and disruptions. For example, in April 2020, we announced a security incident involving a Maze ransomware attack.\nThe attack resulted in unauthorized access to certain data and caused significant disruption to our business. In addition, recent\ninternational tensions (including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East) have heightened the overall risk\nof cyber-threats and, while we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, those steps may not be successful.\nA security compromise of our information systems, or of those of businesses with which we interact, that results in\nconfidential information being accessed by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to\nregulatory actions, up to and including criminal prosecution, client attrition due to reputational concerns or otherwise,\ncontainment and remediation expenses, and claims brought by our clients or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and\nsecurity provisions or data protection laws. Monetary damages imposed on us could be significant and may impose costs in\nexcess of insurance policy limits or not be covered by our insurance at all, and our insurers may not continue to provide\ncoverage on reasonable terms or may disclaim coverage as to any future claims. Techniques used by bad actors to obtain\nunauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems continuously evolve and may not immediately produce\nsigns of intrusion, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In\naddition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our\ninformation systems, diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our businesses.\nOur clients, suppliers, subcontractors, and other third parties with whom we do business, including in particular cloud\nservice providers and software vendors, generally face similar cybersecurity threats, and we must rely on the safeguards\nCognizant 18 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nadopted by these parties. If these third parties do not have adequate safeguards or their safeguards fail, it might result in\nbreaches of our systems or applications and unauthorized access to or disclosure of our and our clients’ confidential data. In\naddition, we are subject to vulnerabilities in third-party technology components we use in our business and are typically not\naware of such vulnerabilities until we receive notice from the third parties who have created the exposure. Due to this delay, our\nresponses to such vulnerabilities may not be adequate or prompt enough to prevent their exploitation.\nAny remediation measures that we have taken or that we may undertake in the future in response to the security incident\nannounced in April 2020 or other security threats may be insufficient to prevent future attacks or insufficient for us to quickly\nrecover from any future attack to efficiently continue our business operations.\nFailure to comply with data security and privacy regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business\noperations and operating results.\nWe are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the United\nStates, the EU, India and in other jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws regulate the collection, use and transfer of\npersonal data and can include significant financial penalties for noncompliance. We may also face audits or investigations by\none or more domestic or foreign government agencies or our customers pursuant to our contractual obligations relating to our\ncompliance with these regulations. Despite positive developments, such as the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which\nprovides a mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the EU to the United States, there remains regulatory uncertainty\nfor businesses transferring data globally. New rules and restrictions on the movement of data across national borders could\nincrease compliance costs, as well as the risk of regulatory enforcement action (including potential financial penalties), private\nlawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, disruption to business and loss of customers.\nIn the United States, federal sectoral laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, alongside\ngrowing state level legislation impose or will impose extensive privacy requirements on organizations that handle personal data.\nProposals for federal comprehensive privacy legislation continue and other new state laws are under consideration. In India, the\nDPDP was approved on August 11, 2023 and is expected to come into effect in phases over the next 6-12 months. The DPDP is\ndesigned to encourage growth in the technology sector; however, much detail (including on requirements for cross border\ntransfers) has been left to subordinate legislation which will be prescribed by the executive arm of the government. The DPDP\nlimits penalties that can be imposed to 2.5 billion Indian rupees or approximately $30 million. Other countries have enacted or\nare considering enacting privacy or data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders. Developing new\nregulations in AI and data use more broadly continue to add to the complexity of the legal environment and managing the\nprivacy elements of these new rules will be critical to our ability to serve our customers as well as to achieve operational\nefficiencies. Complying with these changing regulatory requirements that apply to us directly or indirectly from our impacted\ncustomers requires us to incur substantial costs, exposes us to potential regulatory action or litigation, and may require changes\nto our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and\noperating results.\nPandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks of disease have had and may in the future have a material adverse\nimpact upon our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny pandemic, epidemic or other outbreak of disease may have, widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts\non global society, economies, financial markets and business practices by, among other things, causing significant loss of life,\ncurtailing congregation of people and disrupting communications and travel. Such events may have a material adverse impact\nupon, our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition, including as a result of the following:\n• Reduced client demand for services – Pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks of disease could reduce demand for\nour services, particularly in regions or industries that are significantly impacted by such events. The vast majority of\nour business is with clients in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, all regions that\nwere significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could be impacted by other future outbreaks of disease.\n• Delivery challenges – We could face closures of our clients' facilities that materially impair our ability to deliver\nservices to our clients and satisfy contractually agreed upon service levels during pandemics, epidemics, or other\noutbreaks of disease. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in India, but also in the Philippines and other\ncountries where we have near-shore or offshore delivery operations for clients, as well as our in-country offices and\noffices of clients where our employees may normally work, impacted our ability to deliver services to clients.\n• Increased strain on employees and management – The significant challenges presented by a pandemic or other\noutbreak of disease, such as the potentially life-threatening health risks to employees and their loved ones and the\nunavailability of various services our employees may rely upon, such as childcare, may be a cause of employee morale\nconcerns and may adversely impact employee productivity, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing\nCognizant 19 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nthese employee morale and productivity concerns as well as other significant challenges presented by such events,\nincluding various business continuity measures demands significant management time and attention.\nThe ultimate extent to which any future pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks of disease impact our business, liquidity,\nresults of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be\npredicted with confidence, including the severity of the disease to which the pandemic, epidemic or other outbreak relates;\ndelivery, adoption and effectiveness of vaccines or other treatments for the disease, including any variants; the duration and\nextent of the event and waves of infection; travel restrictions and social distancing; the duration and extent of business closures\nand business disruptions; and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain, treat and prevent the disease. If we or our clients\nexperience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions, our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition\nand the trading price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected, and our ability to access the capital markets\nmay be limited. Further, any future pandemic, epidemic or other outbreak of disease, and the volatile regional and global\neconomic conditions stemming from such an event, could precipitate or amplify the other risk factors that we identify in this\nreport, any of which could have a material adverse impact to our business.\nClimate change and risks arising from the transition to a lower-carbon economy may impact our business.\nThere are inherent climate-related risks everywhere that we conduct our business. Developments related to regulatory,\nsocial or market dynamics, stakeholder expectations, national and international climate change policies, the actual or perceived\nfrequency or intensity of extreme weather events or the availability and functionality of critical infrastructure and resources, in\naddition to other factors resulting from such developments or that may not otherwise be known to or anticipated by us, could\nsignificantly disrupt our supply chain, our clients' operations and our ability to deliver services. Such events could significantly\nincrease our costs and expenses and harm our revenues, cash flows and financial performance. Further, natural disasters and\nadverse weather events, such as droughts, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding, occurring more frequently, with less\npredictability or with greater intensity, could cause community disruptions and impact our employees’ abilities to commute or\nto work from home safely and effectively. For example, we have substantial global delivery operations in Chennai, India, a city\nthat has experienced severe rains and related flooding. Our exposure to these economic and other risks from climate change\ncould be exacerbated if government or market action to address climate change and its effects is insufficient or unsuccessful.\nFailure to meet ESG expectations or standards or achieve our ESG commitments could adversely affect our\nbusiness or damage our reputation.\nOur failure or perceived failure to achieve our ESG commitments, maintain ESG practices, or meet evolving stakeholder\nexpectations could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain clients and employees, and expose us\nto increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities. Our ability to achieve our ESG\ncommitments is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include the\navailability and cost of low- or non-carbon based energy sources and technologies and the availability of suppliers that can meet\nour ESG and other standards. Our reputation also may be harmed by the perceptions that our stakeholders have about our action\nor inaction on certain ESG-related issues, or because they may disagree with our goals and initiatives. Damage to our reputation\nmay reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial performance, as well as require\nadditional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nIn addition, governmental bodies, investors, clients, businesses, employees and potential employees are increasingly\nfocused on ESG issues, including climate change, diversity and inclusion, human rights and supply-chain issues, which has\nresulted and may in the future continue to result in the adoption of new laws and regulations, reporting requirements and\nchanging bid and buying practices. Further, we are subject to, and expect to become increasingly subject to, laws, regulations\nand international treaties relating to climate change, such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements. As these\nnew laws, regulations, treaties and similar initiatives and programs continue to be adopted and implemented, we will be\nrequired to comply or potentially face market access limitations, enforcement actions, civil suits or sanctions, including fines. If\nnew laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased\ncompliance burdens and costs to meet such obligations. If we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, treaties, or reporting\nrequirements, our reputation and business could be adversely impacted.\nCognizant 20 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nIf our risk management, business continuity and disaster recovery plans are not effective and our global delivery\ncapabilities are impacted, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and we may suffer\nharm to our reputation.\nOur business model is dependent on our global delivery capabilities, which include coordination between our delivery\ncenters in India, our other global and regional delivery centers, the offices of our clients and our associates worldwide. System\nfailures, outages and operational disruptions may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as hostilities (including the\nongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East), political unrest, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity\nincidents, power or water shortages or telecommunications failures, natural or man-made disasters or other catastrophic events\n(including extreme weather conditions and other events that may be caused or exacerbated by climate change), and public\nhealth emergencies, epidemics and pandemics, affecting the geographies where our people, equipment and clients are located.\nOur risk management, business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at predicting or mitigating the\neffects of such disruptions, particularly in the case of catastrophic events or longer term, increasingly severe developments that\nmay occur as a result of climate change. Even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly from any such events, if our\nclients cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, they may reduce or terminate our services, which\nmay adversely affect our results of operations. Any such disruption may result in lost revenues, a loss of clients, liabilities\nrelating to disruptions in service, expenditures to repair or replace damaged property and reputational damage, and could\ndemand significant management time and attention, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nLegal, Regulatory and Legislative Risks\nA substantial portion of our employees in the United States, United Kingdom, EU and other jurisdictions rely on\nvisas to work in those areas such that any restrictions on such visas or immigration more generally or increased costs of\nobtaining such visas or increases in the wages we are required to pay employees on visas may affect our ability to\ncompete for and provide services to clients in these jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our employees in the United States and in many other jurisdictions, including countries in\nEurope, rely upon temporary work authorization or work permits, which makes our business particularly vulnerable to changes\nand variations in immigration laws and regulations, including written changes and policy changes to the manner in which the\nlaws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, and potential enforcement actions and penalties that might cause us to lose\naccess to such visas. The political environment in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries in recent years has\nincluded significant support for anti-immigrant legislation and administrative changes. Many of these recent changes have\nresulted in, and various proposed changes may result in, increased difficulty in obtaining timely visas that could impact our\nability to staff projects, including as a result of visa application rejections and delays in processing applications, and\nsignificantly increased costs for us in obtaining visas or as a result of prevailing wage requirements for our employees on visas.\nThe current U.S. administration has continued to explore visa and immigration reform and there continues to be political\nsupport for potential new laws and regulations relating to visas or immigration and the implementation of these or similar\nmeasures in the future may have a material adverse impact on companies like ours that have a substantial percentage of our\nemployees on visas. Our principal operating subsidiary in the United States utilizes a high number of skilled workers holding\nH-1B and L-1 visas and, as a result, may be subject to increased costs if any such laws, regulations, policy changes or executive\norders go into effect. In the EU, many countries continue to implement new regulations to move into compliance with the EU\nDirective of 2014 to harmonize immigration rules for intracompany transferees in most EU member states and to facilitate the\ntransfer of managers, specialists and graduate trainees both into and within the region. The changes have had significant impact\non mobility programs and have led to new notification and documentation requirements for companies sending employees to\nEU countries. Recent changes or any additional adverse revisions to immigration laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate may cause us delays, staffing shortages, additional costs or an inability to bid for or fulfill projects for clients,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAnti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could\nimpair our ability to serve our clients and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe practice of outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the\nUnited States, which is our largest market, as well as other regions in which we have clients. For example, in the United States,\nmeasures aimed at limiting or restricting the performance of services from an offshore location or imposing burdens on U.S.\ncompanies that utilize such services have been put forward for consideration at both the federal and state levels to address\nconcerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically. If any such measure is\nenacted in the United States or another region in which we have clients, our ability to provide services to our clients could be\nimpaired.\nCognizant 21 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, from time to time there has been publicity about purported negative experiences associated with offshore\noutsourcing, such as alleged domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data, particularly involving\nservice providers in India. Current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be\ndiscouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers like us due to negative perceptions that may be associated with\nusing global service delivery models or firms. Any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service\ndelivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services\nfrom within the country in which our clients operate.\nWe are subject to numerous and evolving legal and regulatory requirements and client expectations in the many\njurisdictions in which we operate, and violations of, unfavorable changes in or an inability to meet such requirements or\nexpectations could harm our business.\nWe provide services to clients and have operations in many parts of the world and in a wide variety of different industries,\nsubjecting us to numerous, evolving, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations on matters as diverse as trade controls\nand sanctions, immigration (including temporary work authorizations or work permits), content requirements, trade restrictions,\ntariffs, taxation, antitrust laws, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption laws (including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act),\nthe environment, including climate change regulation and reporting requirements, government affairs, internal and disclosure\ncontrol obligations, data privacy, intellectual property, employment and labor relations, human rights and AI. We face\nsignificant regulatory compliance costs and risks as a result of the size and breadth of our business. For example, we may\nexperience increased costs in 2024 and future years for employment and post-employment benefits in India as a result of the\nissuance of the Code on Social Security, 2020, which enhanced social security coverage (a portion of which is paid by the\nemployer) and extended such benefits to all workers.\nWe are also subject to a wide range of potential enforcement actions, audits or investigations regarding our compliance\nwith these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business, and any finding of a violation could subject us to a wide range of\ncivil or criminal penalties, including fines, debarment, or suspension or disqualification from government contracting,\nprohibitions or restrictions on doing business in one or more jurisdictions, loss of clients and business, legal claims by clients\nand unfavorable publicity or damage to our reputation. We could also face significant compliance and operational burdens and\nincur significant costs in our efforts to comply with or rectify non-compliance with these laws or regulations. Such burdens or\ncosts may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe commit significant financial and managerial resources to comply with our internal control over financial reporting\nrequirements, but we have in the past identified and may in the future identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in\nour internal control over financial reporting that cause us to incur incremental remediation costs in order to maintain adequate\ncontrols.\nOur employees, subcontractors, vendors, agents, alliance partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, vendors\nand agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to\npromote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or\nregulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether\nor not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits\nand suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect\nour business, including our results of operations and our reputation.\nChanges in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, failure by us to adapt our corporate structure and\nintercompany arrangements or adverse outcomes of tax audits, investigations or proceedings could have a material\nadverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe interpretation of tax laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and the related tax accounting\nprinciples are complex and require considerable judgment to determine our income taxes and other tax liabilities worldwide.\nTax laws and regulations affecting us and our clients, including applicable tax rates, and the interpretation and enforcement of\nsuch laws and regulations are subject to change as a result of economic, political and other factors, and any such changes or\nchanges in tax accounting principles could increase our effective worldwide income tax rate and have a material adverse effect\non our net income, cash flows and financial condition. We routinely review and update our corporate structure and\nintercompany arrangements, including transfer pricing policies, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, to align with\nour evolving business operations across the numerous jurisdictions, such as the United States, India and the United Kingdom, in\nwhich we operate. Failure to successfully adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to align with our\nevolving business operations may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our earnings,\ncash flows and financial condition.\nCognizant 22 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nOur worldwide effective income tax rate may increase or our financial condition may be materially impacted as a result of\ndevelopments, changes in interpretations and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued and ongoing and future\nactions the Company has or may take with respect to our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. For example, our\ncash flows could be materially affected by the issuance of additional interpretive guidance by the U.S. Treasury regarding the\ncapitalization and amortization of research and experimental expenses for tax purposes, as more fully described in Note 11 to\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nAdditionally, we are subject to routine tax audits, investigations and proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities\nhave disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions, including\nwith respect to our intercompany transactions. For example, we are currently involved in an ongoing dispute with the ITD in\nwhich the ITD asserts that we owe additional taxes for two transactions by which CTS India repurchased shares from its\nshareholders, as more fully described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. We may not accurately predict the\noutcomes of these audits, investigations and proceedings and the amounts ultimately paid upon their resolution could be\nmaterially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision. Adverse outcomes in any such audits,\ninvestigations or proceedings could increase our tax exposure and cause us to incur increased expense, which could materially\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business subjects us to considerable potential exposure to litigation and legal claims and could be materially\nadversely affected if we incur legal liability.\nWe are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time\nin the conduct of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients,\nalliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions,\nclass actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. While we maintain\ninsurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is\nsubject to various exclusions as well as deductibles and caps on amounts recoverable.\nOur client engagements expose us to significant potential legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our\ncontractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to third parties or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of\nour agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients. For example, third parties could claim\nthat we or our clients, whom we typically contractually agree to indemnify with respect to the services and solutions we\nprovide, infringe upon their IP rights. Any such claims of IP infringement could harm our reputation, cause us to incur\nsubstantial costs in defending ourselves, expose us to considerable legal liability or prevent us from offering some services or\nsolutions in the future. We may have to engage in legal action to protect our own IP rights, and enforcing our rights may require\nconsiderable time, money and oversight, and existing laws in the various countries in which we provide services or solutions\nmay offer only limited protection.\nWe also face considerable potential legal liability from a variety of other sources. Our acquisition activities have in the\npast and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims, including claims from employees, clients, stockholders, or\nother third parties. We have also been the subject of a number of putative securities class action complaints and putative\nshareholder derivative complaints relating to the matters that were the subject of our now concluded internal investigation into\npotential violations of the FCPA and other applicable laws, and may be subject to such legal actions for these or other matters\nin the future. See \"Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for more information. We establish reserves for these and other matters\nwhen a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated; however, the estimation of legal reserves and\npossible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes\ninherent in litigation, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our estimates and materially adversely\naffect our results of operations.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nCognizant 23 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nCybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management program. Our cybersecurity\nrisk management program, which is managed by Cognizant’s Corporate Security team, is designed to identify, assess and\nmanage risks from cybersecurity threats and provides a framework for handling cybersecurity threats and incidents. The\nprogram is also aligned with the risk assessment framework that has been established by the enterprise risk management team.\nOur cybersecurity risk management framework includes steps for assessing the severity of a cybersecurity threat\n(including an escalation process for potentially material cybersecurity threats and incidents to an internal committee comprised\nof members of senior management), identifying the source of a cybersecurity threat (including whether the cybersecurity threat\nis associated with a third-party service provider), implementing cybersecurity countermeasures and mitigation strategies. The\ninternal committee is responsible for assessing the materiality of cybersecurity threats and incidents and informs designated\nmembers of executive leadership and of the Board of Directors of material cybersecurity threats and incidents.\nCognizant's cyber risk management program is periodically audited as part of external certification audits. We also engage\nthird-party cybersecurity experts to assist with risk assessment and conduct penetration testing among other items. Key findings\nfrom the audits and third-party risk assessments are summarized and communicated to the Company’s senior leadership and the\nAudit Committee, and remediation actions are implemented to enhance our overall cybersecurity program.\nWe require our vendors to comply with privacy and cybersecurity requirements, and we perform risk assessments of\nvendors, including their ability to protect data from unauthorized access. We include data protection and security content as part\nof annual training required of employees.\nIn 2023, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. In 2020, we experienced a previously-disclosed\ncybersecurity incident that resulted in unauthorized access to certain data and caused significant disruptions to our business\noperations. In response, we engaged leading outside forensics and cybersecurity experts, launched a comprehensive\ncontainment and remediation effort and forensic investigation, restored the security of our internal systems and networks and\nadopted various enhancements to the security of our systems and networks.\nGovernance\nAs part of our overall enterprise risk management program, we prioritize the identification and management of\ncybersecurity risk at several levels. Our Board of Directors has overall oversight responsibility for our risk management, and\ndelegates cybersecurity risk management oversight to the Audit Committee, which is responsible for ensuring that management\nhas processes in place designed to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks and implement processes and programs to manage\ncybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The Audit Committee previously utilized an IT Cybersecurity\nSubcommittee, comprised of members of the Audit Committee, to assist in carrying out a portion of these responsibilities. In\nDecember 2023, the Audit Committee transitioned away from use of the subcommittee structure. At all times, the full Audit\nCommittee has maintained and continues to maintain oversight responsibility for cybersecurity risk management.\nManagement is responsible for identifying, considering and assessing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis,\nestablishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate\nmitigation measures and maintaining cybersecurity programs.\nOur cyber risk assessment program is managed by our Corporate Security team, which is led by our CSO, who has over\n25 years of experience in the cybersecurity and technology industry. The CSO reports to Cognizant's Executive Vice President,\nGeneral Counsel, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer and Secretary. The CSO manages multiple teams within Corporate Security\nthat are operationally responsible for the security of the Company, including Global Cyber Operations, Business Information\nSecurity, Global Business Resilience and Integrated Risk Management, each of which provides regular updates to the CSO\nregarding cyber threat intelligence, cyber incidents and cyber risk metrics as part of their security responsibilities. The CSO\nworks closely with the CIO, who is responsible for Cognizant's information technology and digital transformation strategy.\nTogether, the CSO and CIO have a mutual set of responsibilities to align, implement, and govern security policies, standards,\nand technology controls throughout the enterprise. On a periodic basis, the CSO and CIO provide updates to the Audit\nCommittee on, among other things, key cybersecurity metrics, status of projects to strengthen the Company's information\nsecurity systems and assessments of the Company's security program. The Audit Committee reports to the Board of Directors,\nwhich also receives periodic updates on such matters.\nCognizant 24 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nCognizant is one of the world’s leading professional services companies, engineering modern businesses and delivering\nstrategic outcomes for our clients. We help clients modernize technology, reimagine processes and transform experiences so\nthey can stay ahead in a fast-changing world. We provide industry expertise and close client collaboration, combining critical\nperspective with a flexible engagement style. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries with an integrated\nglobal delivery model that employs client service and delivery teams based at client locations and dedicated global and regional\ndelivery centers. Our collaborative services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems\nintegration, quality engineering and assurance, application maintenance, infrastructure and security as well as business process\nservices and automation. Digital services continue to be an important part of our portfolio, aligning with our clients' focus on\nbecoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we initiated the NextGen program aimed at simplifying our operating model, optimizing\ncorporate functions and consolidating and realigning office space to reflect the post-pandemic hybrid work environment. Our\ndrive for simplification includes operating with fewer layers in an effort to enhance agility and enable faster decision making.\nWe expect the savings generated by the program to help fund continued investments in our people, revenue growth\nopportunities and the modernization of our office space.\nIn connection with the NextGen program, in 2023 we incurred $115 million of employee separation costs and $114\nmillion of facility exit and other costs totaling $229 million. See Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements. We\ncurrently expect to incur total costs of approximately $300 million with approximately $70 million of such costs anticipated in\n2024. The estimates of the charges and expenditures that we expect to incur in connection with the NextGen program, and the\ntiming thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual\namounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, we may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently\ncontemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur in connection with the NextGen program.\n2023 Financial Results1\nRevenues Income from Operations Operating Margin Diluted EPS\n$19,428M $19,353M $2.97B $2.97B$2.92B 15.3% 15.3% 15.1% $4.41\n$4.21\n$4.40 $4.55\n$2.69B 13.9%\nFY '22 FY '23 FY '22 FY '23 FY '22 FY '23 FY '22 FY '23 FY '22 FY '23 FY '22 FY '23 FY '22 FY '23\nGAAP A d j usted1 GAAP Adjusted1 GAAP Adjusted1\nRevenue declined $75 million Income from Operations Operating margin down 140 Diluted EPS declined $0.20 or\nor 0.4% from 2022; a decline declined $279 million or 9.4% bps compared to 2022 4.5% from 2022\nof 0.3% in constant currency1 from 2022\nAdjusted Operating Margin1 Adjusted Diluted EPS1\nAdjusted Income from down 20 basis points from increased $0.15 or 3.4% from\nOperations1 declined $50 2022 2022\nmillion or 1.7% from 2022\n1 Adjusted Income From Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS and constant currency revenue growth\nare not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Revenue decline was\ndriven by our Financial Services segment, which was negatively impacted by weakness in the banking sector, partially offset by\ngrowth in our Communications, Media and Technology, Products and Resources and Health Sciences segments. Our recently\ncompleted acquisitions contributed 110 basis points to revenue growth, primarily benefiting our Products and Resources and\nCommunications, Media and Technology segments.\nOur operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin2 was 13.9% and 15.1%, respectively, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. This compares to operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin of 15.3% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Our 2023 GAAP and Adjusted Operating Margins were negatively impacted by increased compensation\ncosts, primarily as a result of two merit increase cycles for the majority of our employees since October 2022, partially offset by\nthe benefit of the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, savings generated from our NextGen program and\nimprovement in profitability of a large contract with a Health Sciences client in 2023. In addition, as discussed in Note 4 to our\naudited consolidated financial statements, our 2023 GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by the NextGen charges,\nwhich were excluded from our Adjusted Operating Margin.\nAs a global professional services company, we compete on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and\ntalent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients. We closely monitor attrition trends focusing on the metric\nthat we believe is most relevant to our business. This metric, which we refer to as Voluntary Attrition - Tech Services, includes\nall voluntary separations with the exception of employees in our Intuitive Operations and Automation practice. For the year\nended December 31, 2023 our Voluntary Attrition - Tech Services was 13.8% as compared to 25.6% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. We finished 2023 with approximately 347,700 employees as compared to 355,300 employees at the end of\n2022.\nBusiness Outlook\nSee \"Overview\" within Part I, Item 1. Business for information on our six strategic priorities.\nWe continue to expect the long-term focus of our clients to be on their digital transformation into software-driven, data-\nenabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. We believe clients will continue to contend with industry-specific\nchanges driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and\nconvergence as well as international trade policies and other macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the increasing\nuncertainty related to the global economy, which has affected and may continue to affect their demand for our services.\nWe are focused on expanding our partner ecosystem across a broad range of technology companies, including\nhyperscalers, cloud providers, enterprise software companies, best-in-class digital software enterprises and emerging start-ups.\nWe believe this partner ecosystem will enable us to enhance our innovative, integrated offerings, by combining third-party\nproducts with our service solutions, to deliver enterprise-wide digital transformation.\nWe increasingly use AI-based technologies, including GenAI, in our client offerings and our own internal operations. AI\ntechnologies and services are part of a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We plan to make significant\ninvestments in our AI capabilities to meet the needs of our clients and harness its value in a flexible, secure, scalable and\nresponsible way. As AI-based technologies evolve, we expect that some services that we currently perform for our clients will\nbe replaced by AI or forms of automation. This may lead to reduced demand for certain services or harm our ability to obtain\nfavorable pricing or other terms for our services.\nIn connection with the NextGen program, in 2023 we incurred $229 million in employee separation, facility exit and\nother costs. We currently expect to incur total costs of approximately $300 million in connection with the NextGen program,\nwith approximately $70 million of such costs anticipated in 2024. In addition to the NextGen program, potential tax law and\nother regulatory changes, including possible U.S. corporate income tax reform and potentially increased costs for employment\nand post-employment benefits in India as a result of the Code on Social Security, 2020, among other items, may impact our\nfuture results.

These costs are subject to foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations, which have an impact on our results of operations. We enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge\ncertain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the\nexchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. Net of the impact of the hedges, the depreciation of the Indian\nrupee contributed 90 basis points to the improvement in our operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to December 31, 2022.\nExcluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S.\ndollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 96 basis points in 2023. Each additional 1.0% change in\nexchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by\napproximately 19 basis points (excluding the impact of our cash flow hedges). In 2023, the settlement of our cash flow hedges\nnegatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 13 basis points, compared to a negative impact of 7 basis points in\n2022.\nWe finished the year ended December 31, 2023 with Voluntary Attrition - Tech Services\napproximately 347,700 employees as compared to 355,300 25.6%\nemployees for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The primary reason for the change was to reflect a more complete cost of\ndelivery.

As part of our ongoing\nliquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances. We\nevaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the non-U.S. cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is needed locally\nto execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the United States.\nWe expect operating cash flows, cash and short-term investment balances, together with the available capacity under our\nrevolving credit facilities, to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements, including purchase commitments, tax payments,\nincluding Tax Reform Act transition tax payments, and servicing our debt for the next twelve months. Our remaining Tax\nReform Act transition tax payments are $123 million and $157 million in the years 2024 and 2025, respectively. In 2023, our\nTax Reform Act transition tax payment was $94 million. In addition, we also have purchase commitments of approximately\n$615 million that will be paid over the next four years, of which approximately $180 million will be paid during the next twelve\nmonths. In addition, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our operating lease obligations.\nIn connection with our ongoing dispute with the ITD, on January 8, 2024, the SCI ruled that, in order to proceed with our\nappeal, we must deposit 30 billion Indian rupees ($355 million at the December 31, 2023 exchange rate), representing the time\ndeposits of CTS India under lien, on the condition that, if CTS India prevails at the High Court, the amount deposited will be\nreturned to CTS India, along with interest accrued, within 4 weeks of the judgment. The SCI also requested the High Court to\nconsider and dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as possible, preferably within 6 weeks of the January 8, 2024 ruling. We\nmade the required deposit in January 2024. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, make acquisitions, meet long-term capital\nrequirements beyond a twelve-month period and execute our capital return plan will depend on many factors, including the rate,\nif any, at which cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions with capital stock and the availability of\npublic and private debt, including the ability to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing debt, and equity financing. We\ncannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience, current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated\nfinancial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis. However, the actual amounts may differ\nfrom the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our\nconsolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to\nmake estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes to these estimates could have a material effect\non our results of operations and financial condition. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n7 Free cash flow is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures” for more information.\nCognizant 38 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition. Revenues related to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration\nservices, consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost-to-cost method,\nunder which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to-date\nbears to the total expected labor costs. Revenues related to fixed-price application maintenance, quality engineering and\nassurance and business process services are recognized using the cost-to-cost method, if the right to invoice is not\nrepresentative of the value being delivered. The cost-to-cost method requires estimation of future costs, which is updated as the\nproject progresses to reflect the latest available information. Such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of\njudgment. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change\nin estimate becomes known. Net changes in estimates of such future costs were immaterial to the consolidated results of\noperations for the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets (and related valuation\nallowance, if any) and liabilities requires significant judgment. We are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in\neach of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual\npre-tax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate. In addition, transactions between our affiliated entities are\narranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws, regulations and relevant guidelines. As a result, and due to the\ninterpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines, we have pending applications for APAs before the taxing\nauthorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions. It could take years for the relevant taxing authorities to negotiate and\nconclude these applications. The consolidated provision for income taxes may change period to period based on changes in\nfacts and circumstances, such as settlements of income tax audits, the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or\nfinalization of our applications for APAs.\nOur provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions, as\nwell as the related interest, which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of\ntime to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts. We adjust these reserves in light of changing\nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. To the extent\nthat the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income\ntaxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets, including indefinite-lived\nintangible assets, arise from the accounting for business combinations. We account for business combinations using the\nacquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including any\ncontingent consideration, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price to the individual\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price utilizes estimates and assumptions in determining\nthe fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets, including the\ntiming and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows, anticipated growth rates, client attrition rates and the discount rate\nreflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nAt each acquisition date, we allocate goodwill and intangible assets to our reporting units based on how we expect each\nreporting unit to benefit from the respective business combination. Our seven industry-based operating segments are our\nreporting units. We exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business\ncombination. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying\nvalue. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, regulatory environment,\nestablished business plans, operating performance indicators or competition. Evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires\njudgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and\ndetermination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash\nflow analysis, and a market approach, using market multiples. Under the income approach, we estimate projected future cash\nflows, the timing of such cash flows and long-term growth rates, and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the\nrisk inherent in the projected future cash flows. The discount rate used is based on a market participant weighted-average cost\nof capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related\nto the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value\nbased on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with characteristics\nsimilar to the reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on\noperating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the\ndetermination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nCognizant 39 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nBased on our most recent evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2023, we concluded that the\ngoodwill in each of our reporting units was not at risk of impairment. As of December 31, 2023, our goodwill balance was\n$6,085 million.\nWe review our finite-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. The carrying amount may not be\nrecoverable when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset groups.\nThe impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\nAssessing the fair value of asset groups involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash\nflows, the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nRecently Adopted and New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCognizant 40 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a\nportion of our funds in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the\nuse of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to\ncontinue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to changes in the value of certain foreign\ncurrencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures.\nRevenues from our clients in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Rest of World represented 9.7%, 9.9% and\n6.7%, respectively, of our 2023 revenues, and are typically denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly,\nour revenues may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates, primarily the British pound and the Euro, as compared to\nthe U.S. dollar.\nA predominant portion of our costs in India are denominated in the Indian rupee, representing 24% of our global\noperating costs during 2023, and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations.\nWe have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of\ncertain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the\nimpact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2023, the notional value and weighted\naverage contract rates of these contracts by year of maturity were as follows:\nWeighted Average\nNotional Value Contract Rate (Indian\n(in millions) rupee to U.S. dollar)\n2024 $ 1,878 84.3\n2025 1,020 86.3\nTotal $ 2,898 85.0\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts\ndesignated as cash flow hedges was $13 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2023, which estimates the\nfair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange\nrate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our foreign\nexchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of approximately $278 million.\nA portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non-\noperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2023, we reported foreign currency exchange\ngains, exclusive of hedging gains, of approximately $42 million, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of net\nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. We use\nforeign exchange forward contracts that are scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2024 to provide an economic hedge\nagainst balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional\ncurrency of the subsidiary. At December 31, 2023, the notional value of these outstanding contracts was $1,317 million and the\nnet unrealized loss was $8 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31,\n2023, which estimates the fair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the\nforeign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in\nthe fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedges of approximately $87 million.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have a Credit Agreement providing for a $650 million Term Loan and a $1,850 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility, which are due to mature in October 2027. The Credit Agreement requires interest to be paid, at our option, at either the\nTerm Benchmark, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR or the ABR Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus, in each case,\nan Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Term Loan is a Term Benchmark loan. Thus, our debt exposes\nus to market risk from changes in interest rates. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate\nfluctuations on our interest expense. A 100 basis point change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would\nhave an immaterial effect on our reported interest expense.\nCognizant 41 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nWe have $1,161 million of cash equivalents, $14 million of short-term investments and $435 million of long-term\ninvestments as of December 31, 2023. Our cash equivalents consist of money market funds and time deposits. Our short-term\ninvestments consist primarily of a U.S. dollar denominated investment in a fixed income mutual fund. Our investments are\nexposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. Our\nlong-term investments primarily consist of restricted time deposits and cash equivalents related to the ITD dispute and equity\nmethod investments. As of December 31, 2023, a 100 basis point change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant,\nwould have an immaterial effect on the fair value of our cash equivalents as well as short- and long-term investments.\nInformation provided by the sensitivity analysis of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk does not necessarily\nrepresent the actual changes that would occur under normal market conditions.\nItem 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included\nin Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to\nexpress opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement\nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the\nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nCognizant F-2 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition – Expected Labor Costs to Complete for Certain Fixed-Price Contracts\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, fixed-price contracts comprised $8.7 billion of the\nCompany’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, which includes performance obligations where control is\ntransferred over time. For performance obligations where control is transferred over time, revenues are recognized based on the\nextent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards\ncompletion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the deliverables to be provided. Management recognizes revenues\nrelated to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration services, consulting or other technology\nservices as the service is performed using the cost-to-cost method, under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the\nbasis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs. The cost-to-cost\nmethod requires estimation of future costs, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information.\nRevenues related to fixed-price application maintenance, quality engineering and assurance as well as business process services\nare recognized based on management’s right to invoice for services performed for contracts in which the invoicing is\nrepresentative of the value being delivered. If management’s invoicing is not consistent with the value delivered, revenues are\nrecognized as the service is performed based on the cost-to-cost method described above.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition – expected labor\ncosts to complete for certain fixed-price contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when\ndeveloping the estimated total expected labor costs to complete fixed-price contracts and the significant auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s estimate of total\nexpected labor costs.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nrevenue recognition process, including controls over the development of the estimated total expected labor costs to complete\nfixed-price contracts. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management’s process for\ndeveloping the estimated total expected labor costs for a sample of contracts, which included evaluating the reasonableness of\nthe total expected labor cost assumptions used by management. Evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions related to the\ntotal expected labor costs involved assessing management’s ability to reasonably develop total expected labor costs by (i)\nperforming a comparison of expected labor cost metrics at project inception with actual cost metrics for similar completed\nprojects and (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to previous labor cost\nestimates, including actual labor costs in excess of estimates.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 14, 2024\nWe have served as

STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share data)\nNote 1 — Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe terms “Cognizant,” “we,” “our,” “us” and “the Company” refer to Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation and\nits subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\nDescription of Business. We are one of the world’s leading professional services companies, engineering modern\nbusinesses and delivering strategic outcomes for our clients. We help clients modernize technology, reimagine processes and\ntransform experiences so they can stay ahead in a fast-changing world. We provide industry expertise and close client\ncollaboration, combining critical perspective with a flexible engagement style. We tailor our services and solutions to specific\nindustries with an integrated global delivery model that employs client service and delivery teams based at client locations and\ndedicated global and regional delivery centers. Our collaborative services include digital services and solutions, consulting,\napplication development, systems integration, quality engineering and assurance, application maintenance, infrastructure and\nsecurity as well as business process services and automation. Digital services continue to be an important part of our portfolio,\naligning with our clients' focus on becoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses.\nBasis of Presentation, Principles of Consolidation and Use of Estimates. The consolidated financial statements are\npresented in accordance with GAAP and reflect the consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive\nincome and cash flows of our consolidated subsidiaries for all periods presented. All intercompany balances and transactions\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. We evaluate our estimates on a continuous\nbasis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances. The actual amounts may vary from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments. Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances, including money\nmarket funds, time deposits, certificates of deposits and commercial paper that have a maturity, at the date of purchase, of 90\ndays or less.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the date of purchase and\nreevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We classify and account for our marketable debt securities as either\navailable-for-sale or held-to-maturity. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity\nrequirements, we may sell our available-for-sale securities prior to their stated maturities. We classify these marketable\nsecurities with maturities at the date of purchase beyond 90 days as short-term investments based on their highly liquid nature\nand because such marketable securities represent an investment of cash that is available for current operations. Available-for-\nsale securities are reported at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of\n\"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" on the consolidated statements of financial position until realized. We\ndetermine the cost of the securities sold based on the specific identification method. Our held-to-maturity investment securities\nare financial instruments that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and we classify these securities with maturities\nless than one year as short-term investments. Any held-to-maturity investment securities with maturities beyond one year from\nthe balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments. Held-to-maturity securities are reported at amortized cost.\nInterest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in interest income.\nFor available-for-sale debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be\nrequired to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate qualitative criteria, such as the financial health\nof and specific prospects for the issuer, to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. We also evaluate quantitative criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected\nfuture cash flows. If we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, we consider the security to\ncontain an expected credit loss, and we record the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its recoverable\namount in earnings as an allowance for credit loss and the difference between the security’s recoverable amount and fair value\nin other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is considered impaired, and we recognize the entire difference\nbetween the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings.\nCognizant F-9 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nOn initial recognition and on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our held-to-maturity investment securities for expected credit\nlosses collectively when they share similar risk characteristics or individually, when the risk characteristics are different. The\nallowance for expected credit losses is determined using our historical loss experience. We monitor the credit ratings of the\nsecurities in our portfolio to evaluate the need for any changes to the allowance. An increase or a decrease in the allowance for\nexpected credit losses is recorded through income as a credit loss expense or a reversal thereof. The allowance for expected\ncredit losses is presented as a deduction from the amortized cost. A held-to-maturity investment security is written off when\ndeemed uncollectible.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities. Cash and certain cash equivalents, time deposits, trade receivables, accounts payable and\nother accrued liabilities are short-term in nature and, accordingly, their carrying values approximate fair value.\nProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is\ncalculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Deposits paid towards\nacquisition of long-lived assets and the cost of assets not put in use by the balance sheet date are disclosed under the caption\n\"Capital work-in-progress\" in Note 6.\nLeases. Our lease asset classes primarily consist of operating leases for office space, data centers and IT equipment. At\ninception of a contract, we determine whether a contract contains a lease, and if a lease is identified, whether it is an operating\nor finance lease. In determining whether a contract contains a lease we consider whether (1) we have the right to obtain\nsubstantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the term of the contract, (2) we have the right to\ndirect how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the term of the contract and (3) we have the right to operate the\nasset throughout the term of the contract without the lessor having the right to change the terms of the contract. Some of our\nlease agreements contain both lease and non-lease components that we account for as a single lease component for all of our\nlease asset classes.\nOur ROU lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may include any advance lease\npayments made and any initial direct costs and exclude lease incentives. Our lease liabilities represent our obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the terms of the lease. ROU lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement\nof the lease and are calculated using the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Typically, our lease agreements do\nnot provide sufficient detail to determine the rate implicit in the lease. Therefore, we use our estimated country-specific\nincremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date of the lease to calculate the present value\nof the lease payments. In estimating our country-specific incremental borrowing rates, we consider market rates of comparable\ncollateralized borrowings for similar terms. Our lease terms may include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the\nend of the contractual lease term. Our ROU lease assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain\nthat they will be exercised.\nA portion of our real estate lease costs is subject to annual changes in the CPI. Changes in CPI subsequent to the lease\ncommencement are treated as variable lease payments and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those\npayments is incurred. Other variable lease costs primarily relate to adjustments for common area maintenance, utilities, property\ntax and lease concessions. These variable costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.\nWe elect not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with a term equal to or less than 12\nmonths. We recognize the lease payments in our income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease\npayments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nBoth ROU assets and finance lease assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of the related asset group may not be recoverable.\nInternal Use Software. We capitalize certain costs that are incurred to purchase, develop and implement internal-use\nsoftware during the application development phase, which primarily include coding, testing and certain data conversion\nactivities. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the software. Costs incurred in\nperforming planning and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.\nCloud Computing Arrangements. We defer certain implementation costs that are incurred when implementing cloud\ncomputing service or software-as-a-service arrangements, which primarily include efforts associated with configuration and\ndevelopment activities. Once the service is ready for use, deferred costs are expensed over the term of the arrangement and\nrecognized in income from operations.\nCognizant F-10 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nSoftware to be Sold, Leased or Marketed. We capitalize costs incurred after technological feasibility is reached but before\nsoftware is available for general release to clients, which primarily include coding and testing activities. Once the product is\nready for general release, capitalized costs are amortized over the useful life of the software.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the\nidentification of the acquirer, the determination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the\nacquirer to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including any contingent\nconsideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill represents the excess\nof the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.\nIdentifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their expected useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are\nexpensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our\nconsolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nEquity Method Investments. Equity investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,\nover an investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and recorded in the caption \"Long-term investments\"\non our consolidated statements of financial position. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost. We periodically\nreview the carrying value of our equity method investments to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in\nthe carrying value. The investment balance is increased to reflect contributions and our share of earnings and decreased to\nreflect our share of losses, distributions and other-than-temporary impairments. Our proportionate share of the net income or\nloss of the investee is recorded in the caption \"Income (loss) from equity method investments\" on our consolidated statements\nof operations.\nLong-lived Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets. We review long-lived assets and certain finite-lived intangible assets\nfor impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be\nrecoverable. The carrying amount may not be recoverable when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than\nthe carrying amount of such asset groups. The impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of\nthe asset group exceeds its fair value. Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and developed technology,\nwhich are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets. At each acquisition date, we allocate goodwill and intangible assets to our\nreporting units based on how we expect each reporting unit to benefit from the respective business combination. Our seven\nindustry-based operating segments are our reporting units. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for\nimpairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level by comparing the\nfair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. An impairment of goodwill exists if the carrying\namount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds\nthe reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. For indefinite-lived\nintangible assets, if our qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is\nimpaired, we test the assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of such assets to their carrying value. If an impairment\nis indicated, a write down to the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible asset is recorded.\nStock Repurchase Program. Under the Board of Directors authorized stock repurchase program, the Company is\nauthorized to repurchase its Class A common stock through open market purchases, including under a 10b5-1 Plan, in\naccordance with applicable federal securities laws. We account for the repurchased shares as constructively retired. Shares are\nreturned to the status of authorized and unissued shares at the time of repurchase. To reflect share repurchases in the\nconsolidated statements of financial position, we (1) reduce common stock for the par value of the shares, (2) reduce additional\npaid-in capital for the amount in excess of par during the period in which the shares are repurchased and (3) record any residual\namount in excess of available additional paid-in capital as a reduction to retained earnings.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenues as we transfer control of deliverables (products, solutions and services) to\nour clients in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. To recognize revenues, we apply the\nfollowing five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract,\n(3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5)\nrecognize revenues when a performance obligation is satisfied. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment\nfrom all parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and\ncollectibility of consideration is probable. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay based\non a variety of factors including the customer’s historical payment experience.\nFor performance obligations where control is transferred over time, revenues are recognized based on the extent of\nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards\ncompletion requires judgment and is based primarily on the nature of the deliverables to be provided.\nCognizant F-11 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nRevenues related to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration services, consulting or\nother technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost-to-cost method, under which the total value\nof revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected\nlabor costs. Revenues related to fixed-price application maintenance, quality engineering and assurance as well as business\nprocess services are recognized based on our right to invoice for services performed for contracts in which the invoicing is\nrepresentative of the value being delivered. If our invoicing is not consistent with the value delivered, revenues are recognized\nas the service is performed based on the cost-to-cost method described above. The cost-to-cost method requires estimation of\nfuture costs, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information. Such estimates and changes in\nestimates involve the use of judgment. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting\nperiod in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately,\nwhere appropriate.\nRevenues related to fixed-price hosting and infrastructure and security services are recognized based on our right to\ninvoice for services performed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered. If our\ninvoicing is not consistent with the value delivered, revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis unless revenues are earned\nand obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. The revenue recognition method applied to the types of contracts described\nabove provides the most faithful depiction of performance towards satisfaction of our performance obligations; for example, the\ncost-to-cost method is used when the value of services provided to the customer is best represented by the costs expended to\ndeliver those services.\nRevenues related to our time-and-materials, transaction-based or volume-based contracts are recognized over the period\nthe services are provided either using an output method such as labor hours, or a method that is otherwise consistent with the\nway in which value is delivered to the customer.\nRevenues related to our non-hosted software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or\ncustomization of the underlying software are recognized when the software is delivered as control is transferred at a point in\ntime. For software license arrangements that require significant functionality enhancements or modification of the software,\nrevenues for the software license and related services are recognized as the services are performed in accordance with the\nmethods applicable to application development and systems integration services described above. In software hosting\narrangements, the rights provided to the customer, such as ownership of a license, contract termination provisions and the\nfeasibility of the client to operate the software, are considered in determining whether the arrangement includes a license or a\nservice. Sales and usage-based fees promised in exchange for licenses of intellectual property are not recognized as revenue\nuntil the uncertainty related to the variable amounts is resolved. Revenues related to software maintenance and support are\ngenerally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.\nIncentive revenues, volume discounts, or any other form of variable consideration is estimated using either the sum of\nprobability weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts (expected value) or the single most likely amount in\na range of possible consideration amounts (most likely amount), depending on which method better predicts the amount of\nconsideration to which we may be entitled. We include in the transaction price variable consideration only to the extent it is\nprobable that a significant reversal of revenues recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable\nconsideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether and when to include estimated\namounts in the transaction price may involve judgment and are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance\nand all information that is reasonably available to us.\nRevenues also include the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Our warranties generally provide a customer with\nassurance that the related deliverable will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications\nand are therefore not considered an additional performance obligation in the contract.\nWe may enter into arrangements that consist of multiple performance obligations. Such arrangements may include any\ncombination of our deliverables. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised deliverables, we apply judgment to\ndetermine whether promised deliverables are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these\ncriteria are not met, the promised deliverables are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. For arrangements with\nmultiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate consideration among the performance obligations based on their relative\nstandalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to\nthe customer. When not directly observable, we typically estimate standalone selling price by using the expected cost plus\nmargin or, in limited circumstances, the residual value approach. We typically establish a standalone selling price range for our\ndeliverables, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change.\nCognizant F-12 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nWe assess the timing of the transfer of goods or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to\ndetermine whether a significant financing component exists. As a practical expedient, we do not assess the existence of a\nsignificant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the\ndifference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component\nis deemed to exist. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of\npurchasing our services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. We do not consider set up or transition fees\npaid upfront by our customers to represent a financing component, as such fees are required to encourage customer\ncommitment to the project and protect us from early termination of the contract.\nOur contracts may be modified to add, remove or change existing performance obligations. The accounting for\nmodifications to our contracts involves assessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the\npricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis,\nwhile those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at\nthe standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the\nstandalone selling price. Services added to our application development and systems integration service contracts are typically\nnot distinct, while services added to our other contracts, including application maintenance, quality engineering and assurance\nas well as business process services contracts, are typically distinct.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into arrangements with third party suppliers to resell products or services. In such cases,\nwe evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). In\ndoing so, we evaluate whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. If we control the good or\nservice before it is transferred to the customer, we are the principal; if not, we are the agent. Determining whether we control\nthe good or service before it is transferred to the customer requires significant judgment.\nTrade Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities. We classify our right to consideration in exchange\nfor deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only\nthe passage of time is required before payment is due). For example, we recognize a receivable for revenues related to our time\nand materials and transaction or volume-based contracts when earned regardless of whether amounts have been billed. We\npresent such receivables in \"Trade accounts receivable, net\" in our consolidated statements of financial position at their net\nestimated realizable value. A contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of\ntime. Contract assets are presented in \"Other current assets\" or \"Other noncurrent assets\" in our consolidated statements of\nfinancial position, based on the expected timing of billing, and primarily relate to unbilled amounts on fixed-price contracts\nutilizing the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition. Our contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, consist of advance\npayments from clients and billings in excess of revenues recognized. We classify deferred revenue as current or noncurrent\nbased on the timing of when we expect to recognize the revenues.\nOur contract assets and contract liabilities are reported on a net basis by contract at the end of each reporting period. The\ndifference between the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and contract liabilities primarily results from the\ntiming difference between our performance obligations and the client’s payment. We receive payments from clients based on\nthe terms established in our contracts, which vary from contract to contract.\nAllowance for Credit Losses. We calculate expected credit losses for our trade accounts receivable and contract assets.\nExpected credit losses include losses expected based on known credit issues with specific customers as well as a general\nexpected credit loss allowance based on relevant information, including historical loss rates, current conditions, and reasonable\neconomic forecasts that affect collectibility. We update our allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis with changes in the\nallowance recognized in income from operations.\nCosts to Fulfill. Recurring operating costs for contracts with customers are recognized as incurred. Certain eligible,\nnonrecurring costs (i.e., set-up or transition costs) are capitalized when such costs (1) relate directly to the contract, (2) generate\nor enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future, and (3) are\nexpected to be recovered. These costs are expensed ratably over the estimated life of the customer relationship, including\nexpected contract renewals. In determining the estimated life of the customer relationship, we evaluate the average contract\nterm on a portfolio basis by nature of the services to be provided, and apply judgment in evaluating the rate of technological\nand industry change. Capitalized amounts are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when\nprojected remaining consideration that has not already been recognized as revenue less costs related to the services being\nprovided are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs to fulfill. Costs to fulfill are recorded in\n\"Other noncurrent assets\" in our consolidated statements of financial position and the amortization expense of costs to fulfill is\nincluded in \"Cost of revenues\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCognizant F-13 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and non-\nemployee directors is determined based on the grant date fair value of those awards. We recognize these compensation costs net\nof an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and\nrevised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates. Stock-based compensation expense\nrelating to RSUs and PSUs is recognized as shares vest over the requisite service period. If the minimum performance targets\nare not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized compensation cost is reversed, except for awards subject to\na market condition. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is determined based on the number of stock units granted and the quoted\nprice of our stock at the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs granted subject to a market condition is determined using a Monte\nCarlo valuation model.\nForeign Currency. The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\nare translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly\nexchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the caption \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss)\" on the consolidated statements of financial position.\nForeign currency transactions and balances are those that are denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional\ncurrency. An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. The U.S.\ndollar is the functional currency for some of our foreign subsidiaries. For these subsidiaries, transactions and balances\ndenominated in the local currency are foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency transactions and balances related to non-\nmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency of the entity at historical exchange rates while\nmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency of the entity at current exchange rates. Foreign\ncurrency exchange gains or losses from remeasurement are included in the caption \"Foreign currency exchange gain (losses),\nnet\" on our consolidated statements of operations together with gains or losses on our undesignated foreign currency hedges.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated statements of\nfinancial position as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. Our derivative financial\ninstruments consist primarily of foreign exchange forward and option contracts. For derivative financial instruments to qualify\nfor hedge accounting, the following criteria must be met: (1) the hedging instrument must be designated as a hedge; (2) the\nhedged exposure must be specifically identifiable and must expose us to risk; and (3) it must be expected that a change in fair\nvalue of the hedging instrument and an opposite change in the fair value of the hedged exposure will have a high degree of\ncorrelation. Changes in our derivatives’ fair values are recognized in net income unless specific hedge accounting and\ndocumentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are designated and accounted for as hedges). We record the effective\nportion of the unrealized gains and losses on our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in the\ncaption \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in the consolidated statements of financial position. Any\nineffectiveness or excluded portion of a designated cash flow hedge is recognized in net income. Upon occurrence of the\nhedged transaction, the gains and losses on the derivative are recognized in net income.\nIncome Taxes. We provide for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method,\ndeferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates\napplicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely\nthan not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is\nprovided. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for\nincome taxes in the period that includes the enactment date.\nOur provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as\nwell as any related penalties and interest. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the\nclosing of a tax audit or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. To the extent that the final outcome of these\nmatters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which\nsuch determination is made.\nEarnings Per Share. Basic EPS is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS includes all potential dilutive common stock in the\nweighted average shares outstanding. We excluded less than 1 million of anti-dilutive shares in each of 2023, 2022 and 2021\nfrom our diluted EPS calculation. We include PSUs in the dilutive common shares when they become contingently issuable per\nthe authoritative guidance and exclude them when they are not contingently issuable.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges principally consist of severance and related separation costs, facility exit\ncosts and other related third-party costs necessary to execute the restructuring program. The Company accrues for severance\nand other related separation costs when it is probable that termination benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably\nCognizant F-14 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nestimable. Recognition of employee severance and other separation costs is also dependent on requirements established by\nseverance policy, statutory laws, or historical experience. Facility exit costs generally reflect the accelerated lease expense for\nright-of-use assets, expected lease termination costs, and asset impairments in connection with closure of certain sites, net of\ngains on exit-related disposals.\nRestructuring costs are recorded in “Restructuring charges” in the consolidated statements of operations. The restructuring\nliability related to accrued employee separation costs is included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the\nconsolidated statements of financial position. At the end of each reporting period, the Company evaluates the remaining accrued\nbalances to ensure these balances are properly stated.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nDate Issued\nand Topic Effective Date Description Impact\nNovember 2023 Annual period The new standard requires enhanced segment The Company is currently\nstarting in 2024 disclosures but does not change the definition of a evaluating the impact of the new\nSegment and interim segment for the guidance for determining a reportable standard on its related\nReporting periods starting\nsegment.

Our consulting and\ntechnology services include consulting, application development, systems integration, quality engineering and assurance\nservices as well as software solutions and related services while our outsourcing services include application maintenance,\ninfrastructure and security as well as business process services. Revenues are attributed to geographic regions based upon client\nlocation, which is the client's billing address.

Initially, the Applicable Margin is 0.875% with respect to Term Benchmark loans and RFR loans and\n0.00% with respect to ABR loans. Subsequently, the Applicable Margin with respect to Term Benchmark loans and RFR loans\nwill be determined quarterly and may range from 0.75% to 1.125%, depending on our public debt ratings or, if we have not\nreceived public debt ratings, from 0.875% to 1.125%, depending on our Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of indebtedness for\nborrowed money to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement.

In March 2018, the ITD asserted that it is owed an additional 33 billion Indian rupees ($397\nmillion at the December 31, 2023 exchange rate) on the 2016 transaction.

Our appeal was ruled on unfavorably by the CITA in March 2022 and by the ITAT in September\n2023. We filed an appeal against the order of the ITAT with the High Court.

In\naddition, when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded income tax expense to reflect examination results when the\nposition is effectively settled or otherwise resolved.

The recognition of the benefit in the third\nquarter of 2022 was based on management’s reassessment regarding whether this unrecognized tax benefit met the more-likely-\nthan-not threshold in light of the lapse in the statute of limitations as to a portion of such benefit. In 2021, we reached an\nagreement with the IRS, which settled tax years 2012 through 2016. As a result of this settlement, in the first quarter of 2021,\nwe recorded a $14 million discrete benefit to the provision for income taxes.\nThe unrecognized income tax benefits would affect our effective income tax rate, if recognized.

Fair value is the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy is\nbased on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data\nobtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon their own market\nassumptions.\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:\n• Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 – Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and\nmarket-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.\n• Level 3 – Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are\nunobservable.\nThe following table summarizes the financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\n(in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 327 $ — $ — $ 327\nTime deposits — 834 — 834\nShort-term investments:\nEquity investment security 11 — — 11\nOther current assets\nForeign exchange forward contracts — 15 — 15\nLong-term investments:\nRestricted time deposits (1) — 355 — 355\nOther noncurrent assets\nForeign exchange forward contracts — 5 — 5\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities:\nForeign exchange forward contracts — (14) — (14)\nContingent consideration liabilities — — (30) (30)\nOther noncurrent liabilities\nForeign exchange forward contracts — (1) — (1)\n(1) See Note 11.\nCognizant F-32 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2022:\n(in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 367 $ — $ — $ 367\nTime deposits — 359 — 359\nCommercial paper — 512 — 512\nShort-term investments:\nTime deposits — 51 — 51\nEquity investment security 10 — — 10\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities:\nCertificates of deposit and commercial paper — 225 — 225\nOther current assets:\nForeign exchange forward contracts — 5 — 5\nLong-term investments\nRestricted time deposits (1) — 357 — 357\nOther noncurrent assets:\nForeign exchange forward contracts — 1 — 1\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities:\nForeign exchange forward contracts — (58) — (58)\nContingent consideration liabilities — — (9) (9)\nOther noncurrent liabilities:\nForeign exchange forward contracts — (17) — (17)\nContingent consideration liabilities — — (13) (13)\n(1)See Note 11\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Level 3 contingent consideration liabilities:\n(in millions) 2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 22 $ 35\nInitial measurement recognized at acquisition — 1\nChange in fair value recognized in SG&A expenses 17 (1)\nPayments and other adjustments (9) (13)\nEnding balance $ 30 $ 22\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and\nmeasure the fair value of our equity investment security based on the published daily net asset value at which investors can\nfreely subscribe to or redeem from the fund. The fair value of certificates of deposit and commercial paper is measured based\non relevant trade data, dealer quotes, or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by\nobservable market data, such as yield curves and credit spreads. The carrying value of the time deposits approximated fair value\nas of each of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWe estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows\nmodel. This model calculates the difference between the current market forward price and the contracted forward price for each\nforeign exchange forward contract and applies the difference in the rates to each outstanding contract. The market forward rates\ninclude a discount and credit risk factor. We estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange option contract by using a variant\nof the Black-Scholes model. This model uses present value techniques and reflects the time value and intrinsic value based on\nobservable market rates.\nWe estimate the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with acquisitions using a variation of the\nincome approach, which utilizes one or more significant inputs that are unobservable. This approach calculates the fair value of\nsuch liabilities based on the probability-weighted expected performance of the acquired entity against the target performance\nmetric, discounted to present value when appropriate.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 there were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3\nfinancial assets and liabilities.\nCognizant F-33 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nNote 14 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nChanges in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" by component were as follows for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023:\n2023\nBefore Tax Tax Net of Tax\n(in millions) Amount Effect Amount\nForeign currency translation adjustments:\nBeginning balance $ (256) $ 8 $ (248)\nChange in foreign currency translation adjustments 147 (3) 144\nEnding balance $ (109) $ 5 $ (104)\nUnrealized (losses) gains on cash flow hedges:\nBeginning balance $ (68) $ 17 $ (51)\nUnrealized gains arising during the period 55 (14) 41\nReclassifications of net losses to:\nCost of revenues 23 (5) 18\nSG&A expenses 3 (1) 2\nNet change 81 (20) 61\nEnding balance $ 13 $ (3) $ 10\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss):\nBeginning balance $ (324) $ 25 $ (299)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 228 (23) 205\nEnding balance $ (96) $ 2 $ (94)\nChanges in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" by component were as follows for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021:\n2022 2021\nBefore Tax Tax Net of Tax Before Tax Tax Net of Tax\n(in millions) Amount Effect Amount Amount Effect Amount\nForeign currency translation adjustments:\nBeginning balance $ (22) $ 2 $ (20) $ 56 $ (1) $ 55\nChange in foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments (234) 6 (228) (78) 3 (75)\nEnding balance $ (256) $ 8 $ (248) $ (22) $ 2 $ (20)\nUnrealized gains (losses) on cash flow\nhedges:\nBeginning balance $ 71 $ (14) $ 57 $ 67 $ (12) $ 55\nUnrealized (losses) gains arising\nduring the period (153) 34 (119) 67 (13) 54\nReclassifications of net losses\n(gains) to:\nCost of revenues 13 (3) 10 (55) 10 (45)\nSG&A expenses 1 — 1 (8) 1 (7)\nNet change (139) 31 (108) 4 (2) 2\nEnding balance $ (68) $ 17 $ (51) $ 71 $ (14) $ 57\nAccumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss):\nBeginning balance $ 49 $ (12) $ 37 $ 123 $ (13) $ 110\nOther comprehensive income\n(loss) (373) 37 (336) (74) 1 (73)\nEnding balance $ (324) $ 25 $ (299) $ 49 $ (12) $ 37\nCognizant F-34 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nNote 15 — Commitments and Contingencies\nWe are involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.

Syntel’s complaint alleged breach of\ncontract against TriZetto, and tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets against Cognizant and TriZetto,\nstemming from Cognizant’s hiring of certain former Syntel employees. Cognizant and TriZetto countersued on March 23, 2015,\nfor breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and tortious interference, based on Syntel’s misuse of TriZetto\nconfidential information and abandonment of contractual obligations. Cognizant and TriZetto subsequently added federal\nDTSA and copyright infringement claims for Syntel’s misuse of TriZetto’s proprietary technology. The parties’ claims were\nnarrowed by the court and the case was tried before a jury, which on October 27, 2020, returned a verdict in favor of Cognizant\nin the amount of $855 million, including $570 million in punitive damages. On April 20, 2021, the USDC-SDNY issued a post-\ntrial order that, among other things, affirmed the jury’s award of $285 million in actual damages, but reduced the award of\npunitive damages from $570 million to $285 million, thereby reducing the overall damages award from $855 million to\n$570 million. The USDC-SDNY subsequently issued a final judgment consistent with the April 20th order. On May 26, 2021,\nSyntel filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit, and on June 3, 2021 the USDC-SDNY stayed execution of judgment\npending appeal. On May 25, 2023, the Second Circuit issued an opinion affirming in part and vacating in part the judgment of\nthe USDC-SDNY and remanding the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. The Second Circuit affirmed the\njudgment in all respects on liability but vacated the $570 million award that had been based on avoided development costs\nunder the DTSA, and it remanded the case to the USDC-SDNY for further evaluation of damages. On June 23, 2023, the\nSecond Circuit issued its mandate returning the case to the USDC-SDNY, and the proceedings there regarding damages remain\nongoing. We will not record any gain in our financial statements until it becomes realizable.\nOn February 28, 2019, a ruling of the SCI interpreting the India Defined Contribution Obligation altered historical\nunderstandings of the obligation, extending it to cover additional portions of the employee’s income. As a result, the ongoing\ncontributions of our affected employees and the Company were required to be increased. In the first quarter of 2019, we\naccrued $117 million with respect to prior periods, assuming retroactive application of the SCI’s ruling, in \"Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses\" in our audited consolidated statement of operations. There is significant uncertainty as to how the\nliability should be calculated as it is impacted by multiple variables, including the period of assessment, the application with\nrespect to certain current and former employees and whether interest and penalties may be assessed. Since the ruling, a variety\nof trade associations and industry groups have advocated to the Indian government, highlighting the harm to the information\ntechnology sector, other industries and job growth in India that would result from a retroactive application of the ruling. It is\npossible the Indian government will review the matter and there is a substantial question as to whether the Indian government\nwill apply the SCI’s ruling on a retroactive basis. As such, the ultimate amount of our obligation may be materially different\nfrom the amount accrued.\nOn October 31, 2016, November 15, 2016 and November 18, 2016, three putative shareholder derivative complaints were\nfiled in New Jersey Superior Court, Bergen County, naming us, all of our then current directors and certain of our current and\nformer officers at that time as defendants. These actions were consolidated in an order dated January 24, 2017. The complaints\nassert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, mismanagement, and/or insider\nselling by defendants. On April 26, 2017, the New Jersey Superior Court deferred further proceedings by dismissing the\nconsolidated putative shareholder derivative litigation without prejudice but permitting the parties to file a motion to vacate the\ndismissal in the future.\nOn February 22, 2017, April 7, 2017, May 10, 2017 and March 11, 2019, four additional putative shareholder derivative\ncomplaints were filed in the USDC-NJ, naming us and certain of our current and former directors and officers at that time as\ndefendants. These actions were consolidated in an order dated May 14, 2019. On August 3, 2020, lead plaintiffs filed a\nconsolidated amended complaint. The consolidated amended complaint asserts claims similar to those in the previously-filed\nputative shareholder derivative actions. On February 14, 2022, we and certain of our current and former directors and officers\nmoved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.

Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on October 27,\n2022.\nOn June 1, 2021, an eighth putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the USDC-NJ, naming us and certain of\nour current and former directors and officers at that time as defendants. The complaint asserts claims similar to those in the\npreviously-filed putative shareholder derivative actions. On March 31, 2022, we and certain of our current and former directors\nand officers moved to dismiss the complaint. On November 30, 2022, the USDC-NJ denied without prejudice those motions.\nThe USDC-NJ ordered the parties to conduct limited discovery related to the issue of whether our board of directors wrongfully\nrefused the plaintiff’s earlier litigation demand and, after the conclusion of such limited discovery, to file targeted motions for\nsummary judgment on the issue of wrongful refusal.\nWe are presently unable to predict the duration, scope or result of the putative shareholder derivative actions. Although\nthe Company continues to defend the putative shareholder derivative actions vigorously, these lawsuits are subject to inherent\nuncertainties, the actual cost of such litigation will depend upon many unknown factors and the outcome of the litigation is\nnecessarily uncertain.\nWe have indemnification and expense advancement obligations pursuant to our bylaws and indemnification agreements\nwith respect to certain current and former members of senior management and the Company’s board of directors. In connection\nwith the matters that were the subject of our previously disclosed internal investigation, the DOJ and SEC investigations and the\nrelated litigation, we have received and expect to continue to receive requests under such indemnification agreements and our\nbylaws to provide funds for legal fees and other expenses. There are no amounts remaining available to us under applicable\ninsurance policies for our ongoing indemnification and advancement obligations with respect to certain of our current and\nformer officers and directors or incremental legal fees and other expenses related to the above matters.\nSee Note 11 for information relating to the ITD Dispute.\nMany of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients’ business and provide benefits\nthat are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a client’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients,\nincluding any breach involving a client’s confidential information or sensitive data, or our obligations under applicable laws or\nregulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although\nwe attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in\nrendering our services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in\nall instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage,\nincluding coverage for errors or omissions, we retain a significant portion of risk through our insurance deductibles and there\ncan be no assurance that such coverage will cover all types of claims, continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be\navailable in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future\nclaim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage\nor changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance\nrequirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows for a\nparticular period.\nIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual\narrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with\nrespect to certain matters. These arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and\ncertain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as our breach of certain\nrepresentations or covenants, our intellectual property infringement, our gross negligence or willful misconduct or certain other\nclaims made against certain parties. Payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client\nmaking a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential liability under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in\neach particular agreement. Historically, we have not made material payments under these indemnification agreements and\ntherefore they have not had a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. However, if events\narise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have\nentered, such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash\nflows for a particular period.\nCognizant F-36 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nNote 16 — Employee Benefits\nWe contribute to defined contribution plans, including 401(k) savings and supplemental retirement plans in the United\nStates.

Our client partners, account executives and client relationship managers are aligned in accordance with\nthe specific industries they serve. Our CODM evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on segment\nrevenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs.\nGenerally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors,\npressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by the operating segments\nmay affect revenues and operating expenses to differing degrees.\nIn 2023, we made certain changes to the internal measurement of segment operating profit for the purpose of evaluating\nsegment performance and resource allocation. The primary reason for the change was to reflect a more complete cost of\ndelivery. Specifically, segment operating profit now includes an allocation of both SG&A costs related to our integrated\npractices and the excess or shortfall of incentive-based compensation for commercial and delivery employees as compared to\ntarget, which were previously included in \"unallocated costs.\" We have reported 2023 segment operating profits using the new\nallocation methodology and have recast the 2022 and 2021 results to conform to the new methodology.\nCorporate expenses, expenses related to our NextGen program, a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact\nof the settlements of the cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the\nCODM. Accordingly, such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit and are included below as “unallocated costs”\nand adjusted against our total income from operations. Additionally, we do not disclose assets by segment as a significant\nportion of the assets is used interchangeably among the segments and the CODM does not review such information.\nFor revenues by reportable business segment and geographic area see Note 2.\nSegment operating profits by reportable business segment were as follows:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nFinancial Services $ 1,156 $ 1,323 $ 1,296\nHealth Sciences 1,352 1,190 1,247\nProducts and Resources 984 1,071 960\nCommunications, Media and Technology 625 769 691\nTotal segment operating profit 4,117 4,353 4,194\nLess: unallocated costs 1,428 1,385 1,368\nIncome from operations $ 2,689 $ 2,968 $ 2,826\nGeographic Area Information\nLong-lived assets by geographic area are as follows:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nLong-lived Assets:(1)\nNorth America(2) $ 335 $ 354 $ 377\nEurope 90 86 75\nRest of World(3) 623 661 719\nTotal $ 1,048 $ 1,101 $ 1,171\n(1) Long-lived assets include property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.\n(2) Substantially all relates to the United States.\n(3) Substantially all relates to India.\nCognizant F-39 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nNote 19 — Subsequent Events\nDividend\nOn February 5, 2024, our Board of Directors approved the Company's declaration of a $0.30 per share dividend with a\nrecord date of February 20, 2024 and a payment date of February 28, 2024.\nAcquisitions\nIn January 2024, we acquired 100% ownership in Thirdera, an Elite ServiceNow Partner specializing in advisory,\nimplementation and optimization solutions related to the ServiceNow platform, for a preliminary purchase price of\n$430 million.

A\nfinancial reporting measure is (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the\naccounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements and any measure derived\nwholly or in part from such a measure, and (ii) any measure based in whole or in part on the Company’s\nstock price or total shareholder return.\nIncentive-Based Compensation is deemed to be “Received” in the fiscal period during which the relevant\nfinancial reporting measure is attained, regardless of when the compensation is actually paid or awarded.\n“Covered Executive” means any “executive officer” of the Company as defined under Rule 10D-1.\n“Recovery Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the\nCompany is required to prepare the Restatement, all as determined pursuant to Rule 10D-1, and any\ntransition period of less than nine months that is within or immediately following such three fiscal years.\nIf the Committee determines the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered\nExecutive during a Recovery Period exceeds the amount that would have been Received if determined or calculated\nbased on the Company’s restated financial results, such excess amount of Incentive-Based Compensation shall be\nsubject to recoupment by the Company pursuant to this Policy. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock\nprice or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to\nmathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Restatement, the Committee will determine the\namount based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the relevant stock price or total\nshareholder return. In all cases, the calculation of the excess amount of Incentive-Based Compensation to be\nrecovered will be determined without regard to any taxes paid with respect to such compensation. The Company will\nmaintain and will provide to The Nasdaq Stock Market documentation of all determinations and actions taken in\ncomplying with this Policy. Any determinations made by the Committee under this Policy shall be final and binding\non all affected individuals.\nThe Company may effect any recovery pursuant to this Policy by requiring payment of such amount(s) to\nthe Company, by set-off, by reducing future compensation, or by such other means or combination of means as the\nCommittee determines to be appropriate. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may enforce the\nrecoupment of any or all amounts due under this Policy by withholding future payment of Incentive-Based\nCompensation, cancelling outstanding equity awards (whether vested or unvested) or the scheduled grant of future\nequity awards, seeking reimbursement of previously paid Incentive-Based Compensation, demanding direct cash\npayment (including, but not limited to, the amount of any profits realized by the Covered Executive from the sale of\nCompany equity securities obtained by the Covered Executive upon exercise or grant of any equity compensation\naward), reducing any amount of compensation owed by the Company to the Covered Executive, and/or such other\nmeans determined by the Committee.\nThe Company need not recover the excess amount of Incentive-Based Compensation if and to the extent\nthat the Committee determines that such recovery is impracticable, subject to and in accordance with any applicable\nexceptions under The Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules, and not required under Rule 10D-1, including if the\nCommittee determines that the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the\namount to be recovered after making a reasonable attempt to recover such amounts. The Company is authorized to\ntake appropriate steps to implement this Policy with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation arrangements with\nCovered Executives.\nAny right of recoupment or recovery pursuant to this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other\nremedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any other policy\n(including, but not limited to, the Second Amended and Restated Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\nClawback Policy (the “Existing Policy”), effective October 2, 2023), any employment agreement or plan or award\nterms, and any other legal remedies available to the Company; provided that the Company shall not recoup amounts\npursuant to such other policy, terms or remedies to the extent it is recovered pursuant to this Policy. The Company\nshall not indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any Incentive-Based Compensation pursuant to this\nPolicy."

In the third quarter, we signed six deals with total contract value of more than $100 million each, bringing our year-to-date count to nineteen, which is more than we signed in the full-year 2023. In August, we officially welcomed Belcan to the Cognizant family, and we are excited about the opportunities to jointly expand our presence in the growing ER&D market.\"\n\n**_$ in billions, except per share data_** | **Q3 2024** | **Q3 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n**Revenue** | $5.04 | $4.90  \nY/Y Change | 3.0 % | 0.8 %  \nY/Y Change CC1 | 2.7 % | (0.2 %)  \n**GAAP Operating Margin** | 14.6 % | 14.0 %  \n**Adjusted Operating Margin 1** | 15.3 % | 15.5 %  \n**GAAP Diluted EPS** | $1.17 | $1.04  \n**Adjusted Diluted EPS 1** | $1.25 | $1.16  \n  \nOur recently completed acquisitions contributed approximately 200 basis points to the Y/Y change in revenue.  \n---  \n1 Constant currency (\"CC\") revenue growth, Adjusted Operating Margin, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (\"Adjusted Diluted EPS\") are not measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A full reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Margin guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts. See \"About Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Performance Metrics\" for more information and, as applicable, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  \n  \n\"In the third quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year while also achieving sequential gross margin expansion, driven by better utilization and AI-led productivity, and Adjusted EPS growth of more than 7% year-over-year,\" said Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer. \"Our focus on operating cost discipline and savings generated through our strong execution under the NextGen program have allowed us to expand year-to-date Adjusted Operating Margin by approximately 40 basis points. As we look ahead, our fourth quarter year-over-year organic revenue growth is expected to be stronger than it was in the prior year period, and our large deal momentum provides us a strong foundation to build upon in 2025.\"\n\n**Bookings**\n\nBookings in the third quarter were flat year-over-year. On a trailing-twelve-month basis, bookings declined 2% year-over-year to $26.2 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of approximately 1.3x. During the quarter, we signed six deals each with total contract value of $100 million or greater.\n\n**Employee Metrics**\n\nVoluntary attrition - Tech Services on a trailing-twelve months basis was 14.6% as compared to 16.2% for the period ended September 30, 2023. Total headcount at the end of the third quarter was 340,100 including Belcan, an increase of 3,800 from Q2 2024 and a decrease of 6,500 from Q3 2023.\n\n**Return of Capital to Shareholders**\n\nThe Company repurchased 3.1 million shares for $228 million during the third quarter under its share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, there was $1.4 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorization. In October 2024, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share for shareholders of record on November 19, 2024. This dividend will be payable on November 27, 2024.\n\n**Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Guidance**2****\n\n(all growth rates year-over-year)\n\n  * Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be $5.0 - $5.1 billion, growth of 5.1% to 7.1%, or an increase of 4.8% to 6.8% in constant currency.\n  * Full-year 2024 revenue is expected to be $19.7 - $19.8 billion, growth of 1.6% to 2.1% or an increase of 1.4% to 1.9% in constant currency basis.

These statements include, but are not limited to, express or implied forward-looking statements relating to our strategy, strategic partnerships and collaborations, competitive position and opportunities in the marketplace, investment in and growth of our business, the pace and magnitude of change and client needs related to generative AI, the effectiveness of our recruiting and talent efforts and related costs, labor market trends, the anticipated amount of capital to be returned to shareholders and our anticipated financial performance. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. Existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions, the competitive and rapidly changing nature of the markets we compete in, the competitive marketplace for talent and its impact on employee recruitment and retention, our ability to successfully implement our NextGen program and the amount of costs, timing of incurring costs and ultimate benefits of such plans, our ability to successfully use AI-based technologies, legal, reputational and financial risks resulting from cyberattacks, changes in the regulatory environment, including with respect to immigration and taxes, matters related to the acquisition of Belcan, and the other factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law._\n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Performance Metrics**\n\n__Non-GAAP Financial Measures__\n\n_To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes references to the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS, free cash flow, net cash and constant currency revenue growth. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated._\n\n_Our non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Income from Operations excludes unusual items, such as NextGen charges. Our non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes unusual items, such as NextGen charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments. The income tax impact of each item excluded from Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred. Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities net of purchases of property and equipment. Net cash is defined as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments less short-term and long-term debt. Constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period's foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative period's reported revenues._\n\n_Management believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the Company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain costs, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations._\n\n_A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and may exclude costs that are recurring such as our net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such non-GAAP financial measures._\n\n__Performance Metrics__\n\n_Bookings are defined as total contract value (or TCV) of new contracts, including new contract sales as well as renewals and expansions of existing contracts. Bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large contracts. Our book-to-bill ratio is defined as bookings for the trailing twelve months divided by revenue for the same period. Measuring bookings involves the use of estimates and judgments and there are no independent standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. The extent and timing of conversion of bookings to revenues may be impacted by, among other factors, the types of services and solutions sold, contract duration, the pace of client spending, actual volumes of services delivered as compared to the volumes anticipated at the time of sale, and contract modifications, including terminations, over the lifetime of a contract. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice often without penalty, and some without notice. We do not update our bookings for subsequent terminations, reductions or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

We expect to incur approximately $105 million of costs in 2024 in connection with the NextGen program. Our guidance anticipates pre-tax charges of approximately $0.21 per diluted share for the full year 2024.

This milestone shows Cognizant is more than a quarter of the way toward reaching the program's goal to advance technology job training for one million people worldwide by the end of 2026.\n\n[ ![New Cognizant Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Cognizant\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1794711/Cognizant_Logo_V1.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1794711/Cognizant_Logo_V1.html)\n\nThe rapid progress of Synapse comes at a time when there is a growing desire from organizations to train and redevelop talent. According to new data from Cognizant and Oxford Economics' [New Work New World study,](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4289993-1&h=2164368594&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cognizant.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Finsights%2Finsights-blog%2Fgen-ai-strategy-wf2851465&a=New+Work+New+World+study%2C) more than half (54%) of organizations are focusing on upskilling employees for roles that critically need AI capabilities. However, only 35% of organizations rate their skills and talent as mature, reflecting the challenges in building a workforce equipped for AI _._\n\n\"AI has created a turning point, where skills are increasingly important versus years of experience and network connections,\" said Kathy Diaz, Chief People Officer at Cognizant. \"We launched Synapse a year ago to draw on Cognizant's longstanding learning DNA to equip individuals with the training they need to be part of tomorrow's workforce – including those in underrepresented populations. I'm energized by what we'll continue to accomplish together as we sharpen the skills of our current workforce and create pathways for new talent.\" \n\n\"Technology is rapidly transforming work and the global economy, so it is vital that we equip and train the workforce to benefit from these advancements as well,\" said Tobi Young, Senior Vice President and Chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Cognizant. \"Through Synapse, we're aiming to skill one million people and prepare them for the opportunities in the future of work. We're excited about our progress and committed to making an impact in skilling and sustaining our local communities.\"\n\nTo address workforce disruptions caused by the rapid advancements of AI, Cognizant designed Synapse so that everyone in the company plays an important role in making an impact – for example, employees take advantage of Cognizant's learning and development courses and volunteer to teach students STEM, while the talent division leads jobseeker training, and philanthropic support goes toward supporting skilling and education programs that align with Synapse's goals. \n\nAs Cognizant continues to track towards its goal of training one million individuals through Synapse, it is making progress against five strategic focus areas:\n\n**Skills Accelerator:** The Synapse skills accelerator aims to build a high-quality skilled workforce proficient in emerging technologies like generative AI (Gen AI.) It's intended to equip jobseekers with in-demand tech skills through innovative, sponsored upskilling programs, as well as build a pipeline of experienced and emerging talent that meets today's hiring demands from Cognizant and its Synapse partners. To date, more than 5,000 individuals have participated globally, and the program has successfully provided training across multiple technology stacks. \n\n**Technology Partnerships:** Cognizant is partnering with companies like Microsoft and Google to expand Synapse's reach. Through a [global partnership with Microsoft](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4289993-1&h=174740593&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.microsoft.com%2F2024%2F04%2F22%2Fcognizant-and-microsoft-announce-global-partnership-to-expand-adoption-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise-and-drive-industry-transformation%2F&a=global+partnership+with+Microsoft), more than 76,000 Cognizant developers have been trained on Github Copilot. [Cognizant has also adopted Gemini for Google Cloud](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4289993-1&h=3700340613&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.cognizant.com%2Fnews-and-events%2Fnews%2Fnews-details%2F2024%2FCognizant-and-Google-Cloud-Expand-AI-Partnership-to-Drive-Software-Development-Productivity%2Fdefault.aspx&a=Cognizant+has+also+adopted+Gemini+for+Google+Cloud) to enhance the productivity of its software developers. This initiative aims to enable more than 70,000 associates to leverage Google Cloud's latest AI technologies. Additionally, Cognizant has opened collaboration centers worldwide, with more than 32,000 associates set to undergo training on Google AI technology.\n\n**Apprenticeships** : Cognizant's apprenticeship program is designed as an earn while you learn experience that provides structured learning and on-the-job training to build skills and advance careers across Cognizant's service lines. Through partnerships with universities, community colleges and workforce development groups, Cognizant's apprenticeships aim to train thousands of entry-level associates and mid-career professionals with IT and AI skills. Since launching the apprenticeship program, Cognizant has registered more than 600 apprentices, of which more than 460 have graduated from the program. \n\n**Community Education:** Through philanthropic grants, volunteerism, mentoring, and education partnerships, Synapse's community education programs have impacted more than 97,000 individuals worldwide to date. Through grants to community organizations alone, Cognizant has committed nearly $13 million and upskilled more than 40,000 individuals. Through these grants, Cognizant anticipates skilling nearly 230,000 people by the end of 2026. Additionally, more than 2,800 Cognizant associates have dedicated nearly 19,000 hours to skilling-based volunteering projects since Synapse launched, impacting more than 17,000 people.\n\n**Employee Skilling** : A major risk of the rapidly evolving AI age is that companies could leave their employees behind. In the first year of Synapse, Cognizant has trained more than 195,000 associates worldwide on cutting-edge Gen AI skills through more than 300 learning pathways and technology partnerships. Cognizant has also launched a global Gen AI skilling program, developed in collaboration with Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Salesforce, SAP, and Oracle, that offers cutting-edge content to improve technical skills for employees and individuals outside of Cognizant. More than 2,000 of Cognizant's leaders have completed a curated learning path focused on Gen AI awareness and leading the change.\n\nTo learn more about Synapse, visit the website [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4289993-1&h=1639912031&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cognizant.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fabout-cognizant%2Fsustainability-corporate-citizenship%2Fsynapse&a=here). \n\n**About Cognizant** Cognizant (Nasdaq: CTSH) engineers modern businesses.

Existing and\nprospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only as of the date hereof. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from\nthose expressed or implied include general economic conditions, the competitive and rapidly changing\nnature of the markets we compete in, the competitive marketplace for talent and its impact on employee\nrecruitment and retention, our ability to successfully implement our NextGen program and the amount of\ncosts, timing of incurring costs and ultimate benefits of such plans, our ability to successfully use AI-based\ntechnologies, legal, reputational and financial risks resulting from cyberattacks, changes in the regulatory\nenvironment, including with respect to immigration and taxes, matters related to the acquisition of Belcan,\nand the other factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any\nforward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as\nmay be required under applicable securities law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Performance Metrics\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes\nreferences to the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP\nfinancial measures: Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS, free cash flow, net cash and\nconstant currency revenue growth. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any\ncomprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-\nGAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures\nshould be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The\nreconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures should be\ncarefully evaluated.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Income from Operations\nexcludes unusual items, such as NextGen charges. Our non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Diluted\nEPS excludes unusual items, such as NextGen charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange\ngains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments. The income tax impact of each item\nexcluded from Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations\nin the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred. Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating\nactivities net of purchases of property and equipment. Net cash is defined as cash and cash equivalents\nand short-term investments less short-term and long-term debt. Constant currency revenue growth is\ndefined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange\nrates measured against the comparative period's reported revenues.\nManagement believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the\nCompany provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. For our internal management\nreporting and budgeting purposes, we use various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for financial\nand operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the\ncompensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of\nour competitors. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP measures, which exclude\ncertain costs, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental\ninformation to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nA limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP is that non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our\noperating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and may exclude costs that are recurring such\nas our net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. In addition, other companies may\ncalculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-\nGAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing\nspecific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures to\nallow investors to evaluate such non-GAAP financial measures.\nPerformance Metrics\nBookings are defined as total contract value (or TCV) of new contracts, including new contract sales as\nwell as renewals and expansions of existing contracts. Bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter\ndepending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large contracts. Our book-to-bill ratio\nis defined as bookings for the trailing twelve months divided by revenue for the same period. Measuring\nbookings involves the use of estimates and judgments and there are no independent standards or\nrequirements governing the calculation of bookings. The extent and timing of conversion of bookings to\nrevenues may be impacted by, among other factors, the types of services and solutions sold, contract\nduration, the pace of client spending, actual volumes of services delivered as compared to the volumes\nanticipated at the time of sale, and contract modifications, including terminations, over the lifetime of a\ncontract. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice often without penalty,\nand some without notice. We do not update our bookings for subsequent terminations, reductions or\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Information regarding our bookings is not comparable to,\nnor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our reported revenues.

See “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Performance Metrics” for more information, the definition of Adjusted effective tax rate and Net\nInterest Income as well as a partial reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures at the end of this earnings supplement.\n© 2024 Cognizant\n12\nAPPENDIX:\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures and Performance\nMetrics\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Performance Metrics\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this earnings supplement includes references to the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission as non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS, free cash flow, constant currency revenue growth, Adjusted effective tax rate and net interest\nincome. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial\nmeasures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures should be\nread in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures should be\ncarefully evaluated.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Income from Operations excludes unusual items, such as NextGen charges. Our non-GAAP financial measure\nAdjusted Diluted EPS excludes unusual items, such as NextGen charges, and net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments.\nThe income tax impact of each item excluded from Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred.\nFree cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities net of purchases of property and equipment. Constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period\nrestated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative period's reported revenues. Adjusted effective tax rate reflects a tax rate\ncommensurate with our non-GAAP Adjusted EPS. Net Interest Income is defined as interest income less interest expense.\nManagement believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the Company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. For our internal\nmanagement reporting and budgeting purposes, we use various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period\ncomparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Accordingly, we believe\nthat the presentation of our non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain costs, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our\nmanagement and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nA limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts\nassociated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and may exclude costs that are recurring such as our net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or\nlosses. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative\ntool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nPerformance Metrics\nBookings are defined as total contract value (or TCV) of new contracts, including new contract sales as well as renewals and expansions of existing contracts. Bookings can vary significantly\nquarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large contracts. Our book-to-bill ratio is defined as bookings for the trailing twelve months divided by\nrevenue for the same period. Measuring bookings involves the use of estimates and judgments and there are no independent standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings.\nThe extent and timing of conversion of bookings to revenues may be impacted by, among other factors, the types of services and solutions sold, contract duration, the pace of client spending,\nactual volumes of services delivered as compared to the volumes anticipated at the time of sale, and contract modifications, including terminations, over the lifetime of a contract. The\nmajority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice often without penalty, and some without notice. We do not update our bookings for subsequent terminations, reductions\nor foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Information regarding our bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our reported revenues. However,\nmanagement believes that it is a key indicator of potential future revenues and provides a useful indicator of the volume of our business over time.\n© 2024 Cognizant\n14\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended:\nGuidance Full Year\nMar 31, 2023 Jun 30, 2023 Sep 30, 2023 Dec 31, 2023 Mar 31, 2024 Jun 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2024 2024(1)\nGAAP income from operations $ 702 $ 577 $ 686 $ 724 $ 695 $ 708 $ 738\nNextGen charges(a) — 117 72 40 23 29 33\nAdjusted income from operations $ 702 $ 694 $ 758 $ 764 $ 718 $ 737 $ 771\nGAAP operating margin 14.6 % 11.8 % 14.0 % 15.2 % 14.6 % 14.6 % 14.6 %\nNextGen charges(a) — 2.4 1.5 0.9 0.5 0.6 0.7 ~ 0.5%\nAdjusted operating margin 14.6 % 14.2 % 15.5 % 16.1 % 15.1 % 15.2 % 15.3 % ~15.1%\nGAAP diluted earnings per share $ 1.14 $ 0.91 $ 1.04 $ 1.11 $ 1.10 $ 1.14 $ 1.17\nEffect of NextGen charges, pre-tax — 0.23 0.14 0.08 0.05 0.06 0.07 ~ $0.21\nEffect of non-operating foreign currency\nexchange (gains) loss, pre-tax(b) (0.02) 0.02 — — (0.01) — 0.02 (b)\nTax effect of above adjustments(c) (0.01) (0.06) (0.02) (0.01) (0.02) (0.03) (0.01) (a) (b)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share $ 1.11 $ 1.10 $ 1.16 $ 1.18 $ 1.12 $ 1.17 $ 1.25 $4.63 - $4.67\n(1) A full reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis cannot be\nprovided without unreasonable efforts, as we are unable to provide reconciling information with respect to unusual items, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses\nand the tax effects of these adjustments, and such adjustments may be significant.\nPlease refer to page 16 and 17 of this earnings supplement for corresponding Non-GAAP notes.\n© 2024 Cognizant\n15\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNotes:\n(a) NextGen charges for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include $29 million of employee separation costs and $4 million of facility exit costs.

Thank you for joining the third quarter 2024 earnings call. We\nare pleased with our third quarter results, which delivered revenue and earnings growth while expanding adjusted\nmargin sequentially and represented strong execution of our strategic priorities to accelerate growth, become an\nemployer of choice in our industry and modernize operations. We are seeing a gradual rebound of spend cycles\nand gaining wallet share in financial services while our historical strength in health sciences is driving\ndifferentiation and growth. Meanwhile, our significant traction with large deals and AI led revenue opportunities,\ninvestments in talent and a steadfast focus on operational rigor together led to a strong all round performance.\nLet me begin with a quick summary of our results before an update on our strategic priorities. Third quarter\nrevenue was at the high end of our constant currency guidance range. Revenue of $5 billion grew 3.5%\nsequentially in constant currency, including approximately 150 basis points of inorganic contribution from our\nrecently completed acquisitions.\nYear over year revenue grew by approximately 2.7% in constant currency, including approximately 200 basis\npoints of inorganic contribution. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3% improved sequentially, driven by strong cost\ndiscipline despite investments in Belcan, the partial quarter impact from our annual merit cycle. Adjusted EPS\ngrew approximately 7% year over year. Our fourth consecutive quarter of year over year growth, bringing our year\nto date EPS growth to approximately 5%.\nNow, let me provide an update on the progress we made against our strategic priorities. First, accelerating\ngrowth. Our improving momentum was driven in the quarter by growth in our two largest segments, Health\nSciences and Financial Services, and contribution from our recently completed acquisitions. Health Sciences\nincreased 7.6% year over year in constant currency, backed by our strong, differentiated offerings.\nFinancial Services returned to year over year growth, driven by strong execution and partial return of discretionary\nspending, and we maintained our large deal momentum, signing six deals each with a total contract value of $100\nmillion or more.\nYear-to-date, we signed 19 such deals compared to 17 during all of 2023. We are excited about the all-round\nsustained momentum in large deals across industries and service lines. I am particularly pleased with the traction\nwe are getting in digital engineering, infrastructure and cloud services.\nWe believe in order to sustain this momentum, we must remain at the forefront of our clients innovation agenda,\nwhere today AI is at the top of the list. Our heritage of deep engineering and strong domain expertise, intimate\nclient relationships and flexible operating model has allowed us to quickly respond to this opportunity. We have\nrapidly developed practical tools to help our clients accelerate AI adoption, while also applying it to ourselves as\nwe aim to significantly accelerate our own productivity.\nAI is a profound shift. What I call a double engine transformation because it offers Cognizant the chance to disrupt\nourselves as much as it does for our clients. Consistent with our heritage, we spotted the AI opportunity early and\nin mid-2023, announced plans to invest $1 billion into AI led initiatives, platforms and capabilities.\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nLet me share some examples, beginning with our platforms where our clients are co-creating with us. The\nfoundation of our AI strategy is powered by the Cognizant data and Intelligence Toolkit, which we utilize to\nincrease speed, reduce cost, and improve the predictability of our clients' data modernization journeys.\nTo date, we have over 225 project implementations supporting over 120 clients and our Flowsource platform,\nwhich is a developer workbench that is integrating human and AI effort to improve productivity. Today, we are in\nvarious phases of testing and adoption with more than 150 clients. Using AI tooling, we are generating 150,000\nlines of accepted code per month. That means an annualized basis, 2 million lines of code are accepted by our\ndevelopers into the projects to deliver to our clients.\nIt's a great example of how AI is enabling hyper productivity as we share these productivity gains with clients and\nlower the cost of technology deployment. Our Neuro IT Ops platform, launched in late 2023, is also supporting\n150 clients in various phases of testing and adoption. It enables end to end AI driven automation for IT\noperations, bringing ops and infrastructure in a single pane of glass. As an example, we are leveraging both our\nNeuro IT Ops and Flowsource platforms together in a strategic project for DIRECTV to modernize its technology,\ninfrastructure and enhance its operational capabilities.\nNeuro IT Ops is helping DIRECTV increase efficiency and resiliency through intelligent detection and automated\nIT issue resolution. And Flowsource is scaling GenAI across DIRECTV's software development life cycle,\npromoting innovation through faster time to market, increased collaboration and greater transparency.\nWe recently introduced two new additions to our Neuro suite. First, our enhanced Neuro AI platform incorporates\nmulti-agent orchestration, aims to help enterprises by simplifying problem identification, data generation and AI\nmodel creation and improving decision-making and revenue opportunities. Clients like Gilead Sciences have\npraised this approach, while others like Bayer have tested several foundational capabilities, now available on the\nplatform. These enhancements aim to help our clients to navigate complex decision-making scenarios effectively.\nSecond, Cognizant Neuro Cybersecurity offers AI-enabled enterprise security orchestration for enhanced cyber\nresilience and risk management. This tool is designed to help improve cyber security resilience by integrating and\norchestrating point cybersecurity solutions across the enterprise. We have also infused AI through our TriZetto\nproduct suite, helping improve end user productivity by at least 30%.\nLooking across our enterprise, we now have more than 1,000 GenAI early engagements compared to about 750\nat the end of the second quarter. We are seeing significant traction in four categories of use cases starting with\ntech for tech or applying AI to software development cycles, which had the highest velocity, followed by customer\nand employee experience, content aggregation and early use cases in content generation.\nWe see broad-based demand across industries, including fraud detection, credit risk assessment and regulatory\ncompliance in financial services, drug discovery, medical imaging and transcription in health care and design\noptimization and predictive maintenance in manufacturing. Partnerships and strategic acquisitions are also\nimportant levers in our strategy to accelerate growth.\nFirst an update on our partnerships. I'm excited about our recently announced relationship with Palo Alto\nNetworks through which we will deliver AI-driven cybersecurity capabilities and services for enterprises across\nindustries. We see significant opportunities to leverage AI to keep pace with evolving cybersecurity threats and\nimprove overall levels of security. This last week, ServiceNow announced that Cognizant will be the first system\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nintegrator to bring its new workflow data fabric product to market, giving our joint customers the capability to\nintegrate AI agents and real-time data orchestration layers that can be tightly integrated to their digital workflows.\nWe also announced an expansion of our NVIDIA partnership, bringing together our capabilities with NVIDIA's\nRAPIDS, part of the NVIDIA AI software platform to enhance their data modernization offering. Together, we aim\nto help clients transition to GPU-based infrastructure and accelerate the implementation of this exciting new\nGenAI use cases.\nAnd earlier this week, we strengthened our partnership with Amazon Web Services by signing a strategic\ncollaboration agreement with plans to deliver advanced technology solutions and cloud computing services\nfocused on enhancing smart manufacturing capabilities for global enterprises across multiple industries.\nTurning to our strategic acquisitions. Thirdera acquired earlier this year positioned us as one of the world's largest\nServiceNow partners and as a leader in AI-driven automation and enterprise workflow solutions. And our\nacquisition of Belcan has significantly broadened our access to the $190 billion ER&D services market, which is\nprojected to outpace the legacy IT services market through 2026.\nAdditionally, it has notably increased our footprint in the aerospace and defense industries with an attractive blue-\nchip client base. I'm happy to report that our commercial integration is progressing well. We have already seen\nearly pipeline opportunities and identified the potential for new joint offerings in areas such as model-based\nsystems engineering where Belcan has significant expertise.\nWe believe these actions to accelerate growth are resonating in the market. Let me share a few additional\nhighlights of the value we are bringing to our customers across industries. Within Financial Services, we continue\nto see traction from the changes in investments we have made over the last 20 months. We are bringing the\nbreadth and depth of our capabilities to every opportunity.\nFor example, we are supporting Citizen Bank's ongoing cloud transformation journey. We have collaborated with\nCitizens to revamp their fraud management capabilities with a new in-the-house system. And we are helping\nCitizens elevate their customer banking experience with a modernized system that streamlines dispute resolution.\nIn the UK, we continued to see success winning in the public sector. During the third quarter, we expanded our\nrelationships with the UK Valuation Office Agency of His Majesty's Revenue and Customs. This was one of a\ngreater than $100 million contract signed in the quarter. Under the agreement, we'll provide the UK government\nwith property valuations and advice needed to support taxation and benefits. And clients are still looking to drive\nproductivity and underwrite future innovation. For example, we won a significant $200 million deal in the third\nquarter with a longstanding global technology client to transform the customer support operations using GenAI.\nThis was a vendor consolidation opportunity where we leveraged GenAI to streamline operations, improve agent\nproductivity and reduce costs. Our differentiated AI-led approach, which included elements of outcome-based\npricing allowed us to displace the incumbent.\nNow moving on to our next strategic priority of becoming the employer of choice in our industry. We believe our\ninvestments in talent are bearing fruit as well. We're adding more access to learning and upskilling, notably\nthrough AI in an effort to boost mobility and demonstrate that we are in an organization where our employees can\ngrow. Our grassroots innovation initiative, Bluebolt, continues to build traction with more than 300,000 ideas, of\nwhich 40,000 ideas, mostly related to AI are being presented to clients.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nEmployee engagement scores stayed strong. Trailing 12 months voluntary attrition for tech services is at 14.6%,\nnear multiyear lows. And we are, we were recently named for the second straight year to Forbes list of World's\nBest Employers.\nOur Synapse program, which aims to provide technology training to nearly 1 million people worldwide is another\ngreat example of our deep commitment to learning. I was delighted when Fortune named us as the number seven\nin the world on its prestigious Change the World list while recognizing the impact of Synapse.\nJust last week, we were named number 10 on Newsweek's list of America's most reliable companies. This\nrecognition based on the independent survey of more than 1,700 decision-makers highlights our exceptional\nreliability in delivering services to our clients. We are confident that our expanded breadth of portfolio of services,\nstrengthened by our domain capabilities, talent and partner ecosystem is more resilient and healthier than when I\njoined Cognizant nearly two years ago. And I believe we are in a strong position to capture the growing and\ndeveloping AI opportunity for ourselves and our clients.\nIn closing, a few weeks ago, we brought together over 200 clients to our to our Americas Discovery event in\nAustin, Texas, to showcase the strength of our AI platforms, capabilities and offerings. The event's buzz and\nenthusiasm was incredible. We were excited about the early momentum of large deals with AI-powered\nproductivity and numerous initial products. Our belief is the AI productivity way will evolve from task automation to\nbusiness process to business model transformation, leading to new products and revenue streams and faster\ninnovation cycles, a flywheel of new opportunities to tap into. I want to thank all our employees globally for their\ncommitment to our clients and the work to strengthen our capabilities for the future.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jatin, who will cover the details of the quarter and progress against our third\nstrategic priority of modernizing operations.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJatin Pravinchandra Dalal\nChief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nThank you, Ravi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered a solid third quarter\nperformance with revenue at the high end of our constant currency growth guidance range and a return to organic\nyear-over-year revenue growth for the first time in six quarters.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to focus on modernizing our operations. This helped us increase gross margin\nby 50 basis points sequentially, driven by improved utilization and increased adoption of automation and AI within\ndelivery. This allowed us to deliver adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, which modestly exceeded our\nexpectation despite headwinds from acquisition related costs and a partial quarter impact from our annual merit\ncycle that became effective on August 1. Year-to-date, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, a 40\nbasis point increase year-over-year.\nNow let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue was $5 billion, growing 3.5% sequentially in constant currency,\nincluding approximately 150 basis points of inorganic contributions from about five weeks of Belcan. Year-over-\nyear, revenue increased 2.7% in constant currency. This included approximately 200 basis points of growth from\nrecent acquisitions.\nFrom an industry standpoint, Health Sciences was our strongest segment, growing 7.6% year-over-year in\nconstant currency. Growth here was broad-based across payer, provider and life sciences. On the payer and\nprovider side, clients continue to seek our TriZetto platform solution for modern scalable cloud solutions. In\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nparticular, our BPaaS offering has seen healthy demand for its delivery of true end-to-end revenue cycle\nmanagement, including clearing house services.\nOn the Life Sciences side, growth has been supported by the ramp-up of recent large deal wins. Our Financial\nServices segment grew 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. This performance added to last quarter's\nmomentum and benefited from an uptick in the discretionary demand environment and better execution. Growth\nwas led by banking and financial services clients in North America. In Canada, we have seen strong performance\nacross both banking and insurance customers.\nProducts and Resources revenue grew 4.6% year-over-year in constant currency, driven primarily by the\ncontribution of Belcan. We have seen pockets of discretionary weakness with clients in manufacturing, logistics,\naerospace and automotive industries. We are sharply focused on grid modernization, software defined vehicles\nand smart manufacturing. This area, we believe will drive significant opportunity in the long run.\nCMT declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency, primarily reflecting a continued tight discretionary\nspending environment across customers in both technology and telecom and media.\nMoving on to the details by geography, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant\ncurrency. Growth in the third quarter was led by Americas geography, which increased about 4%. This was driven\nby the strength in Financial Services and Health Sciences and the contribution from Belcan.\nEurope declined about 2% and has been impacted by software discretionary spending. However, recent wins in\nour largest segments helped support positive sequential growth in Europe. And we are optimistic about the growth\nopportunity we see in areas like the UK and Ireland, Germany and the Nordics. We delivered healthy growth in\nour Rest of the World region, which increased about 4%. Performance in this geography was driven by recent\nlarge deals, particularly within comms, media and technology and strength in financial services.\nTurning to bookings. Third quarter bookings were roughly flat year-over-year, driven in part by the lumpiness of\nlarge deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings were $26.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year and represented\na 1.3x book-to-bill. As Ravi mentioned, we signed six deals in the quarter that each had a TCV value of more than\n$100 million. This included four deals in Health Sciences, one in financial services and one in CMT.\nI am also pleased that two of these six deals were from outside of North America, one each in Europe and Rest of\nWorld. We also saw TCV from smaller deals stabilized sequentially. This has led to a modest improvement in our\ntrailing 12-month annual contract value trend from last quarter. We are seeing this reflected in our improved\nrevenue performance this quarter despite muted TCV performance.\nNow moving on to margins. In the third quarter, we incurred $33 million of costs related to NextGen, which\nnegatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 70 basis points. Adjusted operating margin\nwas 15.3%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year.\nOur sequential improvement was driven by gross margin, which expanded approximately 50 basis points quarter-\nover-quarter. We delivered this through operational rigor, improved utilization and corresponding lower [ph] batch\n(22:18) costs. We are also making progress in modernizing our operation, increasingly leveraging our AI platforms\nin delivery to help improve fulfillment and increase productivity with fewer resources.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nIn Q3, our GAAP tax rate was 22.7%, and adjusted tax rate was 22.2%, reflecting a benefit from the timing of\ndiscrete items. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.17 and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.25. This represented year-over-\nyear growth of 13% and 7%, respectively.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2 billion or net\ncash of about $800 million. This reflects our $1.3 billion acquisition of Belcan in the third quarter, which was\nfunded primarily through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. DSO of\n81 days was one day up sequentially and increased four days year-over-year driven by our business mix.\nFree cash flow of Q3 was $791 million, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1 billion. There is\nno change to our full year free cash flow conversion guidance. We continue to expect full year free cash flow to\nrepresent about 80% of the net income. This includes previously disclosed negative impact from $360 million\npayment made to the Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter in the first\nquarter.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $391 million to shareholders, including $242 million in aggregate through share\nrepurchases and $149 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. As of September 30, we had $1.4\nbillion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nYear-to-date, we have returned approximately $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and\ndividends. And for the full year, we now expect to return approximately $1.2 billion. This includes approximately\n$100 million of share repurchases to offset the new shares issued as part of the Belcan acquisition.\nTurning now to our forward outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to increase 4.8% to 6.8% in\nconstant currency. On an as reported basis, this translates to revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, representing\nyear-over-year growth of 5.1% to 7.1%. This guidance reflects the benefit of full quarter of Belcan, partially offset\nby year-end seasonality, including the impact of lower bill days and furloughs. For the full year, we have tightened\nthe revenue range and maintained the midpoint. We now expect revenue to grow 1.4% to 1.9% in constant\ncurrency. On and as reported basis, this translates to revenue of $19.7 billion to $19.8 billion, representing growth\nof 1.6% to 2.1%.\nOur outlook includes approximately 200 basis points of inorganic contribution, unchanged from our prior\nassumption. As Ravi mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Belcan in late August. There are no changes to the\nfinancial projections we shared at the time of the acquisition announcement in June. We anticipate the transaction\nwill generate over $100 million in annual revenue synergies within three years and be accretive to EPS starting in\nfull year 2026.\nMoving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance. We now expect full\nyear adjusted operating margin will be approximately 15.1%, which is the midpoint of our prior range. The fourth\nquarter adjusted operating margin is expected to be impacted by the full quarter impact of Belcan, including\nintegration related costs, and the impact of non-cash amortization of acquired customer intangibles. It also will\ninclude the full quarter impact from our [indiscernible] (27:20) cycle that was effective August 1. We expect these\nheadwinds will be partially offset by continued rigor in operations and the savings associated with our NextGen\nprogram.\nFor the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $65 million, which compare s to $55 million\npreviously, primarily reflecting the latest cash balance assumptions. Our full year adjusted tax rate guidance of\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\n24% to 25% is unchanged. Our guidance for shares outstanding is also unchanged at approximately $497 million.\nOur full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is $4.63 to $4.67, which is up from $4.56 to $4.64 previously.\nWith that, we will open the call for your questions.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Great. Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator\nInstructions] Our first question here is from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJason Kupferberg Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nThank you, guys. So just looking at the midpoint of Q4 guidance, our math suggests organic growth will be right\naround 2%. So I just wanted to check and see if that's right. And if so, is that a floor we can think about for\nCognizant to accelerate off of in 2025, especially since it seems like you are starting to see a turn up in\ndiscretionary spending in your largest vertical? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nYes. So I thought the upper end of the Y-on-Y quarter four was around 2%. So you're right that in quarter four, we\nare starting to build an organic Y-on-Y positive movement. I mean the midpoint is going to be 1% and the upper\nend is going to be 2%. So it's a good tail velocity to get into 2025.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJason Kupferberg Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nOkay, okay. Understood. And then I wanted to come back to some of the comments around sharing savings from\nthe AI-enabled coding efforts with your clients. What would you estimate the productivity improvement has been\nthat you're seeing from those AI-enabled coding efforts? And what are the positive offsets that you're seeing to\navoid revenue cannibalization?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nJason, this is a complex, a complicated economic and a complicated – the response is going to be a little, I would\nsay, complicated as well. Let me state how this works. When we have productivity which is non-linear and not\nlabor oriented, and it is new, you have an opportunity to go and tell your clients, if you have time and material\nbusiness, we can translate that to fixed price business and share the benefits with them.\nIf you have noticed, I mentioned about 2 million lines of code annually accepted by our developers. So that\nnumber is going to keep going up. So our ability to share those benefits with the clients actually makes us more\ncompetitive in the market. In fact, many of my clients have actually said, when you share these benefits and the\ncost of deployment goes down, we can take our backlog down, that's a very positive side. I mean clients are not\nsaying because of productivity, we'll reduce our budgets. They're actually saying we want to do more for less. So\nthat is a very positive indicator. It also gives us an opportunity to consolidate in places where our productivity is\nhigher than our peers. We can actually, we can offer consolidation and, therefore, increase revenue throughput to\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nus. One of the examples I mentioned in my remarks is about a client where we displaced an incumbent because\nwe actually showed up with a higher productivity.\nNow there is a third set, where you could arguably say clients, it will cannibalize our revenue. But those are the\ntimes you want to be creative and you go back to clients and say, \"Look, the work packet we did, we could do it\nfor less. But you know what, if we consolidate it, we could actually do more for less,\" which then means you could\nprotect your turf, but you could choose to share the productivity benefits.\nThen there is a fourth set, which I would actually say is time and material work, where in some ways, the\nproductivity benefits can generate the value, but you have to work with your clients to move that work to fixed\nprice. So I would actually believe this is a very positive development. There is elasticity in tech spend. So if you\ncan reduce the cost of deployment, clients are actually going to spend more with you. And we believe we are\nahead of the curve in comparison to all our peers. And that's why we're winning more large deals and we are able\nto protect our turf.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJason Kupferberg Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nVery helpful. Thanks, Ravi.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nTien-Tsin Huang Q\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\nThanks a lot. Good afternoon, here. I wanted to ask on the large deal pipeline, considering you signed quite a bit\nhere year-to-date more than last year, your confidence in being able to replenish the large deal pipeline from\nhere, Ravi.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nYes. So last year, we did 17 for the full year, $100 million deals, more than $100 million deals. This year, we're\nalready at 19, more than $100 million deals. I'm very confident that we can sustain the momentum. The way to\nsustain this is not just look for transformational opportunities where the spend goes up, but also look for cost\ntakeout efficiency and vendor consolidation opportunities. Similar to what I mentioned in my previous response,\nthere's always an opportunity to consolidate using productivity. So we are excited about it.\nI think we have to – we are starting to see now large deals in Europe and Asia Pacific. In fact, out of the six deals\nwe did this quarter, one of them was in Asia Pacific, one of them was in Europe, and we had a similar large deal\nin Asia Pacific last quarter as well. So we can expand. I mean this is also concentrated in a few industries. Now\nwe are stepping up and taking a broader view of other industry. So the expansion will come from more industries.\nThe expansion will come from going beyond Americas, which has already started happening. And the expansion\nwill come from also our services landscape.\nTwo years ago, a lot of our work was related to tech services and BPO. Now we have tech services, BPO,\nengineering because of the Belcan acquisition and some of the acquisitions we did before. We are now a top five\nplayer in engineering services. And interestingly, we are getting quite a bit of traction on infrastructure services,\nwhich we were historically not having those many large deals. So right now, all four capability sets are firing\ncylinders. So I'm very confident about how we can sustain the large deal momentum.\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nTien-Tsin Huang Q\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\nNo, that's great. That's good color. It actually segues nicely into my follow-up question because I know one of\nyour objectives was to diversify. You just mentioned you're doing that geographically and across some of your\npractices. But healthcare is now your largest vertical looks like, which is so used to seeing BFSI being the biggest\nrecognizant. But where are you in the journey now to expand into some of other under indexed verticals. Is that\nstill a priority? Can we expect that to come? Or is it more work to do on what we discussed before?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nNo, that's a great question. I would say if you look at our revenue mix and the momentum we have, I mean, look\nat healthcare, we have grown 7.6% Y-on-Y. Both sequentially, we've grown and we have grown Y-on-Y. So we\nare very excited about the opportunities in healthcare, the differentiation we have and the lead we have in some\nof the areas is unmatched. So healthcare, we are very confident.\nFinancial services, we are back on track. I mean, this is the, this quarter, last quarter, we did sequential growth.\nThis quarter, we have done Y-on-Y growth and sequential growth. So again, financial services has a very different\nmuscle. I think we have now stabilized, and we do believe that we are winning the wallet share there.\nWe now have, I would believe, a unique opportunity in industrial and manufacturing with Belcan in the mix. And\nthat's because they have, we have access to blue-chip clients in aerospace. We have that capability set in\nengineering, which gives us a chance to go into industrial and manufacturing and automotive. It is a sector where\nwe do believe we are now going to build a muscle to win deals, large deals. And I think we have a breadth of\ncapability all the way from engineering services to tech services.\nThe vertical comps, which if you have noticed, there has been a lower pace of spend in comps. But as that picks\nup, I think we have put a good team to get that moving. Where we have to make progress on is energy, oil and\ngas, where we have a much lower presence. And that's something I'm going to work on.\nSo the idea of the last two years, what we have essentially done is we've created breadth of capability all the way\nfrom engineering, BPO, technology services and infrastructure services. We have created now more expansive\nopportunities on industries. I have work to do on international markets outside the U.S. But very pleased with the\nprogress we've made so far because this expansive, the strategy of expansion has helped us to keep the\nsustained momentum on our large deals.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nTien-Tsin Huang Q\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\nThank you for the complete answer there. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJames Edward Schneider Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the momentum in healthcare, you just talked about\nearlier. So maybe to follow up on last question. Maybe as you think about your backlog of business for 2025.\n11\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nObviously, you're not providing guidance now, but can you maybe tell us directionally which verticals do you think\nmight outperform your overall corporate revenue growth in 2025? And then which ones might lag a little bit?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nYes. So Jim, as you look at the deal wins and, the momentum that we have built, certainly financial services and\nhealthcare will continue to lead the growth of the company. We have to build back momentum that we had all\nthrough 2023 in CMT, Comps Media and Telecom, as we get into next year. And manufacturing has been slow,\nbut one hopes that, that should also come through. So I think that is the order, Jim, for us to look at who would\nlead the growth as we look at next few quarters.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJames Edward Schneider Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nThank you. And then maybe as a follow-up. It was good to see the gross margin leverage you delivered in the\nquarter. You mentioned part of that is utilization, but also part of it was AI, as you mentioned in the quarter. Can\nyou maybe just help us on a go-forward basis into Q4? And then 2025 with sort of the moving pieces of gross\nmargins, how much of those gains are sustainable? And what should we think about in terms of the mix of Belcan\nin Q4 and beyond in terms of where gross margins should land?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nSure, Jim. So let me start with Belcan because that's easier to get out of the way. I think Belcan will not have a\nmaterial movement on the gross margin number of the company they operate at a similar sort of range. So we\nshould be okay. There should not be any noise from that.\nNow from a classic gross margin standpoint, the levers are utilization, automation and productivity led by AI is\nanother one. Pyramid is the third one and the fourth is really the pricing. So I would say these are the four most or\nlargest [ph] rivers. (41:25) The fifth is offshore mix, but offshore mix, typically tends to be driven more by the\nrequirements of our customer in time and material business. And only in the fixed-price projects, we have more\nflexibility around offshore. So I would count sort of four big ones and fifth one, which can be leveraged in specific\nsituations.\nSo, as we look at the performance of this year, certainly utilization has continued to inch up every quarter. And I\nthink we still have some flex left as we enter quarter four. Automation, led by AI is a tremendous opportunity. We\nhave executed well in 2024, and I still feel we'll continue to get additional leverage of that as we build a greater\nrollout capability, greater absorption capability of that within our delivery, within our spectrum of our delivery.\nThe Pyramid is certainly an ongoing initiative. We have had, as an organization and as an industry struggle to\nkeep up with the reasons of Pyramid, all through 2020, 2021, 2022 as the industry went through a shock of a\nsudden drop of demand and then sudden increase in demand I think we are getting back to that rhythm of\nbuilding Pyramid. So I would say it is not a lever for 2025, but it certainly is a lever as we look at next three years\nand that we are putting a great internal initiative around.\nAnd finally, pricing. Pricing in the current environment is, I would say, competitive. It's not something that is adding\nto gross margin today, but it is a factor of the demand environment. So that's how I see it, Jim.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n12\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nJames Edward Schneider Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.

Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question is from Maggie Nolan from William Blair. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMaggie Nolan Q\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\nHi, thank you. Do you view financial services as leading in terms of how IT spend may trend across your business\nand end markets? Or do you view the dynamics of the financial services performance to be more vertical specific\nand Cognizant specific at this time?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nWe're very pleased with how we have gone about structurally turning around our financial services business.\nWhen I came on board, we had both company-specific issues and market-specific issues. I would say the\ncompany-specific issues have more or less gone. They were gone at least a few quarters ago. We put a good\nteam on board now, very stable team. We now have compelling offerings, and we are working the corridors of our\nclients. So we are starting to see the wallet share gain for ourselves.\nThere is uptick in spending in financial services clients, and we are probably seizing those dollars ahead of some\nof our peers, and therefore, we are starting to see that. I am very optimistic that financial services will continue to\ngo back to a high discretionary environment at some point in time because it's also one of the most cutting-edge\ninnovative industries. And they all have [ph] retained (45:13) organizations where a lot of technology innovation is\ndone in partnership with companies like ours.\nWe always had that muscle before. I mean, we were one of the leading financial services players across the\nworld, and it does, I do believe that we have got that mojo back. So depending on how the market turns around in\nfinancial services, we will grab those opportunities.\nWe do not have any specific company-specific challenges which we had in the past. So that gives me the\nconfidence that we have the differentiation, the agility, the team and as the market keeps bouncing back. I mean\nthere is a rebound of discretionary dollars in financial services. And as that continues to go up. We are in a great\nspot to gain more wallet share.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMaggie Nolan Q\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\nOkay. Thank you. And then any changes that you're seeing in the sales cycle and the conversion rate, both for\nthis quarter that you just reported? And then also your forward expectations just given that continued large deal\ntraction, but also what appears to be the early return of some the smaller discretionary deals and demand?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nYes. The smaller discretionary deals are starting to take a little momentum. So, on the large deals, I would say the\nbiggest change I have seen in the last few months is, if we are able to put a proposal on the table where you can\n13\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nfeed into the legacy, make savings, underwrite those savings for innovation. I think clients love that flywheel. So\nclients are not saying I'm going to spend a ton more. But clients are saying, can you do more for less.\nSo the AI tooling is helping us to do more for less. And those savings are getting translated to innovation dollars\nand translated to backlog getting cleared. I think that is a new, it's a new model which is helping us to win those\ndeals. I mean, when we win these large deals, those dollars are not going back elsewhere, they're actually going\nback to technology. And we are able to put a model where we underwrite those dollars for the innovation. So\nthat's the change. That's what clients are looking for in an industry of this kind where you can do more for less,\nthe spend is elastic. I mean, you can – if you do more for less the spend, you could get more done, and therefore,\nclients are going to offer you more. That's because the spend is elastic. You get more value, you get more\nprojects to be done.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMaggie Nolan Q\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\nMakes sense. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJames E. Friedman Q\nAnalyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nHi, thank you. So I wanted to ask briefly on your view of the durability of the Health Science recovery. Ravi, the\nresults speak for themselves. It's a very, it's a clear turnaround. But we're getting a lot of questions that the end\nmarket seems to be volatile. And if you could unpack that maybe to the Payer and Life Science side, but how do\nyou see the change in the end market, especially on the Payer side potentially impacting the demand for your\nservices?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nThat's a great question. There are four segments here, there is Payer, Provider, Pharma Benefit and Life\nSciences. Life Sciences clearly is a standout because Life Sciences clients are no longer using technology for\nenabling their business, they're using technology at the core. And we have some extraordinary capability of\npartnering with our clients for that core business. This is not enabling the business I mean enabling the business\nis IT systems, enabling the core is discovery cycle, the drug discovery cycle and the ability to apply technology to\nsupport it. We have really some very good capability there, including Life Sciences manufacturing. So I think that's\na sector which will continue to invest in technology to reduce the drug development cycle, and we think we have a\ngood opportunity there.\nOn Payer, as you would have noticed, there's a lot of cost takeout, which is going to happen because the PMPM\nas I call it, the cost per member per month that is under pressure. So you have to start to think about how do\npayers reduce their cost and increase the value towards care. So we think technology can be that enabler to\nreduce cost.\nJust to give you an example, on TriZetto, we applied Generative AI. And we are able to take out 30% cost for\ncase managers and end users who are processing claims. The administrative costs in payers is so high that you\ncould use technology and you could use the power of AI to create more, generate more values, more straight\nthrough processing.\n14\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nOur auto adjudication on claims has significantly gone up. I mean we could auto adjudicate claims without human\nintervention. So there is so much happening on the payer side on technology that it's a cost takeout opportunity\nrather than anything else. Cost take out is going to lead to transformation of payer.\nProvider, there's a very distributed market, and there is consolidation happening on providers. And I think we\nhave, again, a unique opportunity because our TriZetto platform today has a large pool of providers. In fact, we\nhave 200 million members, and we have thousands of providers who are on our platform. We also do Clearing\nHouse, which is a combination of payer and provider because the Clearing House actually sits on the gateways\nbetween providers and payers.\nPharma benefit companies, very small number and they are themselves going through a transformation. So, is\nthere going to be more consolidation? Is there going to be more change? Is there going to be more transformation\nin this sector? Yes, but they're all going to be powered by technology. So we think our unique position in\nhealthcare, our unique position in healthcare is going to be a huge benefit for the opportunities which come out\nthere. So I'm excited about the transformation in this entire value chain, which is going to happen in the next few\nyears.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJames E. Friedman Q\nAnalyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nOkay. Great answer. I'll drop back in the queue. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: The next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBryan Keane Q\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nHi. Hey, Ravi, to me, it sounds like you're using GenAI as an advantage to come in and price below some of the\npeers using your guys' expertise in the technology to replace some incumbents and pass on some productivity\ngains. Is that fair?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nYes. I know Yes. If the engagement model allows us to do that, we could share those benefits with our clients. In\nthe past, it was labor-led, the labor-led cycles are pretty much, I mean, we have really optimized it across the\nindustry. The new cycles are technology-led. And AI-led and automation-led productivity sharing the benefit with\nour clients, I think, is a mainstream model which we are adapting to win these large deals where we have had\nsustained momentum.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBryan Keane Q\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nYes, because the argument will be that it's a deflationary environment for the overall IT services adds more of the\ncost saves and productivity gains from GenAI gets passed on, the old time and materials models come under\npressure and the yields are lower. The outcomes-based pricing is going to yield a lower outcome for the\ncontracts. So it's got a deflationary impact. So you've got to make it up by volume is the only way you can make\nfaster growth.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n15\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nYes. So my thesis there is almost every CIO, I have spoken about has actually said, they have a backlog, which\nthey want to clear. And this is our opportunity to clear the backlog. There are CIOs who have actually told us that,\nlook, there is so much technical debt sitting with us. I mean there is a report which talks about $1 trillion of\ntechnical debt in U.S. balance sheets, American Corporation balance sheets. Almost $400 billion is actually being\nspent on. Again, another report which talks about spent on servicing that debt. And because of that, a lot of\nmoney is being spent on the run versus the build. So this is our opportunity to readjust the run in the build. So,\nand that's what I was referring to earlier. We were able to reduce the run costs and transfer that to the build, you\ncan actually build more stuff. So technology spend is so elastic that, I mean it will remain elastic because it is\nsuch a transformational tool that you could, if you do more for less, you're actually going to get more to do\nbecause there is no, the headroom is so high. So I actually believe that the thesis of doing more for less is only\ngoing to generate more opportunities for us.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBryan Keane Q\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nAnd is it roughly 20% to 40% less or how much more or less is it? You know the pricing.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nYes, it's a hard to put a number because it depends on the phase of the technology cycle. If it's pure play\ndevelopment, it is much higher. If it's testing, it is much higher. Equally, if you're in a fiercely competitive situation,\nyou probably give it away to – you partially give it away to clients. There's also the maturity of the client, which\nkind of determines how much you can get productivity.\nSo there is a compelling proposition to do fixed price and more managed services deals. But there are always\ncompanies which have huge [ph] retained (56:59) organizations, and they use companies like us to engage on a\ntime and material or a capacity-base because they have strategically taken a call to build their own tech shop.\nIn fact, we are actually helping some of those clients to build their tech shop. There are captives being set in\nIndia. We are actually a pioneering partner to partner with our clients to set up their captives. That's another\nopportunity which has kind of evolved in the last one year. And again, I'm excited about it. I don't see that as\ncannibalization. I see that as an opportunity to stay more relevant with them.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBryan Keane Q\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: The last question is from Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBryan C. Bergin Q\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\nHi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you. Want to know, I have a follow-up question here on the forward view. If\nyou're targeting kind of an organic exit rate of about 1% of the midpoint, and flattish bookings here when we\nconsider the year ahead, are there puts and takes about the conversion of the multi-year larger deals versus\n16\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nCognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\n(CTSH) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nsome of the smaller deals picking up to support the nearer-term growth rate acceleration. Just any thoughts you\nwant to share directionally about growth considerations as we get closer to 2025?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nSure. So if you see this year, every quarter, we have been able to execute to the growth agenda that we set in the\nbeginning of the quarter. This is the first quarter, quarter three was our first quarter of organic growth in, over the\nlast few quarters. We are exiting with a significantly better velocity than what we had at the end of 2023. So that\ncertainly sets up well. But we will, I think it's, what is critical for us is really focus and execute well to quarter four,\nand then look at the opportunity that presents us in beginning of 2025 and then guide for 2025. So I would say\nlittle early to talk about 2025, but quite happy with the progress that we are making every quarter in, on the\ntrajectory.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBryan C. Bergin Q\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\nOkay. Understood. And then when we think about the margin levers, specifically on utilization. Do you have a\ntargeted optimal level for you as you manage the [ph] bench, (59:35) see you've gotten back to 84%. Can you\nlean on that more until demand recovers? Or is that an upper bound as you think about utilization?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRavi Kumar Singisetti A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nI do think there is a little more flex left on that, certainly, that I see, but not a lot more.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBryan C. Bergin Q\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\nOkay. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Thank you.
