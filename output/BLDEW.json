Given the FAA's recent release of the necessary guidelines for future operations as well as the incoming administration’s stated agenda of achieving adoption ahead of other countries, we believe the timeline for this transition has greater clarity.\"\n\n\"We're pleased to see great conversion of Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which improved to $3.7 million in Q3 2024, approximately three times the prior year period, demonstrating the cash benefits of our drive to Passenger profitability and the growth in Medical,\" said Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer. \"Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved 15.1% with margins expanding 70 basis points in Q3 2024 versus the prior year, despite a softer than expected Q3 for US organ transplant volumes. Regardless, October was one of the highest revenue months for Medical in company history and we continue to take market share, including two recent customer wins for high-volume transplant centers that we expect to begin flying in the coming months.\"\n\nHeyburn added, \"We are also excited to announce a strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to their _metra_ perfusion device. We know from speaking with our customers that demand for _metra_ currently exceeds the supply of available machines. This partnership will enable higher utilization of available _metra_ devices through rapid distribution, utilizing Blade's air and ground logistics, to transplant centers who need them on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\n\"During the quarter, we acquired two additional aircraft which we expect to enter service by early 2025, bringing our owned fleet to ten,\" said Melissa Tomkiel, President. \"Our aircraft ownership strategy is already bearing fruit, enabling us to win new medical contracts in recent months that required asset ownership. However, lower medical flight volumes in Q3 led to negative operating leverage while above average expenses on our owned aircraft fleet, including entry into service delays, did lead to lower Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 2024 versus Q2 2024. Though quarter to quarter lumpiness in volumes and maintenance expenses may happen from time to time, we have already seen a normalization in the performance of our owned fleet Q4 to date.\"\n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenue increased 4.8% to $74.9 million in the current quarter versus $71.4 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by growth in Medical and Short Distance partially offset by Jet and Other.\n  * Flight Profit _(_ 1) increased 27.3% to $19.8 million in the current quarter versus $15.6 million in the prior year period, driven by strong growth in both the Medical and Passenger segments.\n  * Flight Margin _(_ 1) improved to 26.5% in the current quarter from 21.8% in the prior year period, driven primarily by a strong summer season in the Northeast, improved profitability in New York Airport and benefits from restructuring actions taken in Europe and Canada in Passenger.\n  * Medical revenue increased 7.8% to $36.1 million in the current quarter versus $33.4 million in the prior year period. Medical revenue decreased (5.9)% sequentially versus Q2 2024 driven primarily by air trip volume that declined in line with industry transplant volumes, and a reduction in block hours per air trip as we increased the size of our dedicated fleet and positioned these aircraft closer to our largest hospital clients. This strategy reduces empty leg repositioning, improving outcomes and increasing economic efficiency for our customers while fortifying our value proposition to hospitals and making many other operators uncompetitive in these regions.\n  * Short Distance revenue increased 6.5% to $32.4 million in the current quarter versus $30.4 million in the prior year period. Excluding Canada, which was discontinued, Short Distance revenue increased 9.8% versus the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by Northeast Leisure, Other Short Distance and New York Airport.\n  * Jet and Other revenue decreased 15.0% to $6.5 million in the current quarter versus $7.6 million in the prior year period driven by a decline in revenue per flight as charter industry pricing normalized.\n  * Net loss increased by $2.2 million versus the prior year to $(2.0) million in Q3 2024 driven primarily by a $6.0 million decrease in non-cash income from change in fair value of warrant liability, partially offset by a $3.9 million reduced loss from operations.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA _(_ 1) improved by $3.4 million year-over-year to $4.2 million in the current quarter versus $0.8 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a $2.8 million improvement in Passenger Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.5 million year-over-year and Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses and Software Development decreased (1.3)% versus the prior year period.\n  * Operating Cash Flow increased by $4.3 million to $6.4 million in Q3 2024. Capital expenditures of $9.9 million were driven primarily by the $7.3 million purchase of aircraft in the Medical segment. Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is net of all capital expenditures, including aircraft maintenance expenses, but excludes the impact of aircraft acquisitions, increased by $2.4 million to $3.7 million in Q3 2024.\n  * Ended Q3 2024 with $136.3 million in cash and short term investments.\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights and Recent Updates**\n\n  * Announced strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to OrganOx's _metra_ normothermic machine perfusion device. The _metra_ device extends liver preservation times, aiding the identification of viable donor livers, enabling longer-distance transportation and increasing the utilization of donor organs. OrganOx will preposition _metra_ devices at strategic locations across the United States, utilizing air and ground logistics from Blade's wholly-owned subsidiary, Trinity Medical, to enable rapid deployment to transplant centers.\n  * Seven of the eight previously announced aircraft acquisitions operated in Q3 2024, with the eighth aircraft entering service in October. We signed agreements to acquire two additional aircraft during Q3 2024 that are expected to enter service by early 2025. With a fleet size of ten, our owned fleet will only represent approximately one third of our Medical flying hours with the majority remaining on third-party aircraft.\n  * Medical's organ placement service offering (\"TOPS\") continues to gain market share with five contracted customers today and a strong sales pipeline.\n  * Completed an acquisition in Medical that expands our captive ground network and fleet of vehicles that will enable us to better serve our New York area customers.\n  * Restructured our European operations which is expected to improve profitability and enable stronger organizational and commercial alignment with our local partner.\n  * Completed exit from Canada in our Passenger business.\n\n\n\n(1) See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Information\" sections attached to this release for an explanation of Non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\n**Financial Outlook****(****1****)**\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue of $240 million to $250 million\n  * Positive Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect:\n\n  * Double-digit Medical revenue growth\n  * Passenger revenue of $85 million to $95 million\n  * Double-digit millions of Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call starting at 8:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 to discuss the results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nA live audio-only webcast of the call may be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://ir.blade.com/. An archived replay of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website for one year.\n\n(1) We have not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance included above to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs, the most significant of which are incentive compensation (including stock-based compensation), transaction-related expenses, certain fair value measurements, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nBlade believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") results, provide useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses, SG&A, Adjusted SG&A, Flight Profit, Flight Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables within this press release.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA – Blade reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Blade defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income and expense, income tax, realized gains and losses on short-term investments, impairment of intangible assets and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nAdjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses – Blade defines Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses as expenses that cannot be allocated to either of our reporting segments (Passenger and Medical) and therefore attributable to our Corporate expenses and software development, less non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nSG&A and Adjusted SG&A – Blade defines SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue. Blade defines Adjusted SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue and excluding non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nFlight Profit and Flight Margin – Blade defines Flight Profit as revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ ground transportation revenue using the Company’s owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries. Blade defines Flight Margin for a period as Flight Profit for the period divided by revenue for the same period. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide an important measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they focus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with those operations such as third party variable costs and costs of owning and operating Blade's owned aircraft.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions – Blade defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Blade also reports Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is Free Cash Flow excluding cash outflows for aircraft acquisitions. Blade believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions provide important insights into the cash-generating capability of the business, with Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisition specifically highlighting the cash generated by our core operations before the impact of discretionary strategic investments in new aircraft.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n**BLADE AIR

Based in New York City, Blade's asset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to facilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft (“EVA” or “eVTOL”), enabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free. \n\nFor more information, visit www.blade.com.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of words such as \"will\", “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “continue,” “expect,” “estimate,” “may,” “plan,” “outlook,” “future,” \"target,\" and “project” and other similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable and may also relate to Blade’s future prospects, developments and business strategies. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements concerning Blade’s future financial and operating performance (including the discussion of 2024 and 2025 financial outlook and guidance), the composition and performance of its fleet, results of operations, industry environment and growth opportunities, new product lines and partnerships, and the development and adoption of EVA technology. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside Blade’s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include: our continued incurrence of significant losses; failure of the markets for our offerings to grow as expected, or at all; our ability to effectively market and sell air transportation as a substitute for conventional methods of transportation; reliance on certain customers in our Passenger segment revenue; the inability or unavailability to use or take advantage of the shift, or lack thereof, to EVA technology; our ability to successfully enter new markets and launch new routes and services; any adverse publicity stemming from accidents involving small aircraft, helicopters or charter flights and, in particular, any accidents involving our third-party operators; any change to the ownership of our aircraft and the challenges related thereto; the effects of competition; harm to our reputation and brand; our ability to provide high-quality customer support; our ability to maintain a high daily aircraft usage rate; changes in consumer preferences, discretionary spending and other economic conditions; impact of natural disasters, outbreaks and pandemics, economic, social, weather, geopolitical, growth constraints, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances on metropolitan areas and airports where we have geographic concentration; the effects of climate change, including potential increased impacts of severe weather and regulatory activity; the availability of aircraft fuel; our ability to address system failures, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our website, applications, backend systems or other technology systems or those of third-party technology providers; interruptions or security breaches of our information technology systems; our placements within mobile applications; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our use of open source software; our ability to expand and maintain our infrastructure network; our ability to access additional funding; the increase of costs and risks associated with international expansion; our ability to identify, complete and successfully integrate future acquisitions; our ability to manage our growth; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage; the loss of key members of our management team; our ability to maintain our company culture; our reliance on contractual relationships with certain transplant centers and Organ Procurement Organizations; effects of fluctuating financial results; our reliance on third-party operators; the availability of third-party operators; disruptions to third-party operators; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage for our third-party aircraft operators; the possibility that our third-party aircraft operators may illegally, improperly or otherwise inappropriately operate our branded aircraft; our reliance on third-party web service providers; changes in our regulatory environment; risks and impact of any litigation we may be subject to; regulatory obstacles in local governments; the expansion of domestic and foreign privacy and security laws; the expansion of environmental regulations; our ability to remediate any material weaknesses or maintain internal controls over financial reporting; our ability to maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls; changes in the fair value of our warrants; and other factors beyond our control.

Given the FAA's recent release of the necessary guidelines for\nfuture operations as well as the incoming administration’s stated agenda of achieving adoption ahead\nof other countries, we believe the timeline for this transition has greater clarity.\"\n\"We're pleased to see great conversion of Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft\nAcquisitions, which improved to $3.7 million in Q3 2024, approximately three times the prior year\nperiod, demonstrating the cash benefits of our drive to Passenger profitability and the growth in\nMedical,\" said Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer. \"Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved\n15.1% with margins expanding 70 basis points in Q3 2024 versus the prior year, despite a softer than\nexpected Q3 for US organ transplant volumes. Regardless, October was one of the highest revenue\nmonths for Medical in company history and we continue to take market share, including two recent\ncustomer wins for high-volume transplant centers that we expect to begin flying in the coming\nmonths.\"\nHeyburn added, \"We are also excited to announce a strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden\naccess to their metra perfusion device. We know from speaking with our customers that demand for\nmetra currently exceeds the supply of available machines. This partnership will enable higher\nutilization of available metra devices through rapid distribution, utilizing Blade's air and ground\nlogistics, to transplant centers who need them on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\"During the quarter, we acquired two additional aircraft which we expect to enter service by early\n2025, bringing our owned fleet to ten,\" said Melissa Tomkiel, President. \"Our aircraft ownership\nstrategy is already bearing fruit, enabling us to win new medical contracts in recent months that\nrequired asset ownership. However, lower medical flight volumes in Q3 led to negative operating\nleverage while above average expenses on our owned aircraft fleet, including entry into service\ndelays, did lead to lower Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 2024 versus Q2 2024.\nThough quarter to quarter lumpiness in volumes and maintenance expenses may happen from time\nto time, we have already seen a normalization in the performance of our owned fleet Q4 to date.\"\nThird Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights\n▪ Total revenue increased 4.8% to $74.9 million in the current quarter versus $71.4 million in the\nprior year period, driven primarily by growth in Medical and Short Distance partially offset by\nJet and Other.\n▪ Flight Profit(1) increased 27.3% to $19.8 million in the current quarter versus $15.6 million in the\nprior year period, driven by strong growth in both the Medical and Passenger segments.\n▪ Flight Margin(1) improved to 26.5% in the current quarter from 21.8% in the prior year period,\ndriven primarily by a strong summer season in the Northeast, improved profitability in New York\nAirport and benefits from restructuring actions taken in Europe and Canada in Passenger.\n(1) See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Information\" sections attached to this\nrelease for an explanation of Non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure.\n3\n▪ Medical revenue increased 7.8% to $36.1 million in the current quarter versus $33.4 million in\nthe prior year period. Medical revenue decreased (5.9)% sequentially versus Q2 2024 driven\nprimarily by air trip volume that declined in line with industry transplant volumes, and a\nreduction in block hours per air trip as we increased the size of our dedicated fleet and\npositioned these aircraft closer to our largest hospital clients. This strategy reduces empty leg\nrepositioning, improving outcomes and increasing economic efficiency for our customers while\nfortifying our value proposition to hospitals and making many other operators uncompetitive in\nthese regions.\n▪ Short Distance revenue increased 6.5% to $32.4 million in the current quarter versus $30.4\nmillion in the prior year period. Excluding Canada, which was discontinued, Short Distance\nrevenue increased 9.8% versus the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by\nNortheast Leisure, Other Short Distance and New York Airport.\n▪ Jet and Other revenue decreased 15.0% to $6.5 million in the current quarter versus $7.6\nmillion in the prior year period driven by a decline in revenue per flight as charter industry\npricing normalized.\n▪ Net loss increased by $2.2 million versus the prior year to $(2.0) million in Q3 2024 driven\nprimarily by a $6.0 million decrease in non-cash income from change in fair value of warrant\nliability, partially offset by a $3.9 million reduced loss from operations.\n▪ Adjusted EBITDA(1) improved by $3.4 million year-over-year to $4.2 million in the current\nquarter versus $0.8 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a $2.8 million improvement\nin Passenger Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nincreased $0.5 million year-over-year and Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses and\nSoftware Development decreased (1.3)% versus the prior year period.\n▪ Operating Cash Flow increased by $4.3 million to $6.4 million in Q3 2024. Capital expenditures\nof $9.9 million were driven primarily by the $7.3 million purchase of aircraft in the Medical\nsegment. Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is net of all capital expenditures,\nincluding aircraft maintenance expenses, but excludes the impact of aircraft acquisitions,\nincreased by $2.4 million to $3.7 million in Q3 2024.\n▪ Ended Q3 2024 with $136.3 million in cash and short term investments.\nBusiness Highlights and Recent Updates\n▪ Announced strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to OrganOx's metra\nnormothermic machine perfusion device. The metra device extends liver preservation times,\naiding the identification of viable donor livers, enabling longer-distance transportation and\nincreasing the utilization of donor organs. OrganOx will preposition metra devices at strategic\nlocations across the United States, utilizing air and ground logistics from Blade's wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, Trinity Medical, to enable rapid deployment to transplant centers.\n▪ Seven of the eight previously announced aircraft acquisitions operated in Q3 2024, with the\neighth aircraft entering service in October. We signed agreements to acquire two additional\naircraft during Q3 2024 that are expected to enter service by early 2025. With a fleet size of\nten, our owned fleet will only represent approximately one third of our Medical flying hours with\nthe majority remaining on third-party aircraft.\n▪ Medical's organ placement service offering (\"TOPS\") continues to gain market share with five\ncontracted customers today and a strong sales pipeline.\n▪ Completed an acquisition in Medical that expands our captive ground network and fleet of\nvehicles that will enable us to better serve our New York area customers.\n▪ Restructured our European operations which is expected to improve profitability and enable\nstronger organizational and commercial alignment with our local partner.\n▪ Completed exit from Canada in our Passenger business.\n(1) See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Information\" sections attached to this\nrelease for an explanation of Non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure.\n4\nFinancial Outlook(1)\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n▪ Revenue of $240 million to $250 million\n▪ Positive Adjusted EBITDA\nFor the full year 2025, we expect:\n▪ Double-digit Medical revenue growth\n▪ Passenger revenue of $85 million to $95 million\n▪ Double-digit millions of Adjusted EBITDA\nConference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call starting at 8:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday November 12, 2024\nto discuss the results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nA live audio-only webcast of the call may be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the\nCompany’s website at https://ir.blade.com/. An archived replay of the call will be available on the\nInvestor Relations section of the Company's website for one year.\n(1) We have not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance included above to the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs,\nthe most significant of which are incentive compensation (including stock-based compensation), transaction-related expenses, certain\nfair value measurements, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a\npotentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n5\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nBlade believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of\nour reported U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") results, provide useful\ninformation to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the\noverall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater\ntransparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational\ndecision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly\ntitled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Unallocated Corporate\nExpenses, SG&A, Adjusted SG&A, Flight Profit, Flight Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow,\nbefore Aircraft Acquisitions have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables within\nthis press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA – Blade reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Blade\ndefines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based\ncompensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income and expense, income tax,\nrealized gains and losses on short-term investments, impairment of intangible assets and certain\nother non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company\noperating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\nAdjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses – Blade defines Adjusted Unallocated Corporate\nExpenses as expenses that cannot be allocated to either of our reporting segments (Passenger and\nMedical) and therefore attributable to our Corporate expenses and software development, less non-\ncash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of\nongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between\nperiods.\nSG&A and Adjusted SG&A – Blade defines SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of\nrevenue. Blade defines Adjusted SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue and\nexcluding non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe\nare indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of\nresults between periods.\nFlight Profit and Flight Margin – Blade defines Flight Profit as revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of\nrevenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of\naircraft and vehicles, right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating\norgan ground transportation revenue using the Company’s owned vehicles and costs of operating our\nowned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot\nsalaries. Blade defines Flight Margin for a period as Flight Profit for the period divided by revenue for\nthe same period. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide an important measure of\nthe profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they focus solely on the non\ndiscretionary direct costs associated with those operations such as third party variable costs and\ncosts of owning and operating Blade's owned aircraft.\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions – Blade defines Free Cash Flow as\nnet cash provided by / (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized software\ndevelopment costs. Blade also reports Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is Free\nCash Flow excluding cash outflows for aircraft acquisitions. Blade believes that Free Cash Flow and\nFree Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions provide important insights into the cash-generating\ncapability of the business, with Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisition specifically highlighting the\ncash generated by our core operations before the impact of discretionary strategic investments in new\naircraft.\n6\nFinancial Results\nBLADE AIR

          "content": "Q3 2024 Investor Update\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 1\nTo Our Shareholders,\nI’m extremely proud of our team’s effort in reaching an important milestone this quarter in our Passenger business,\nachieving positive Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the trailing twelve month period ending September 30, 2024, more than\na full year ahead of our previous guidance to achieve profitability by the end of 2025. In Q3 2024, we saw significant\nmargin expansion, driven by both our Passenger and Medical Segments, resulting in a 27.3% year-over-year increase in\nFlight Profit while Adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million increased more than fivefold compared to $0.8 million in the prior\nyear period. We’re also pleased to see strong conversion of Adjusted EBITDA into cash flow as we generated $6.4 million\nof operating cash flow and $3.7 million of free cash flow before aircraft acquisitions in the quarter.\nWe had a strong summer season, particularly for Northeast\nLeisure, that drove Q3 2024 Short Distance revenue up 6.5%\nyear-over-year or 9.8% excluding our discontinued Canadian\noperations. Our Passenger segment enjoyed a significant\nimprovement in profitability this quarter, with Passenger Flight\nProfit up 31.0% versus the prior year period, Passenger\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA doubling, and Passenger\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 14.4%\nversus 7.3% in the prior year period. On top of strong\nunderlying customer demand, several factors contributed to\nour faster path to profitability in Passenger.\nWe’ve taken action to exit unprofitable business lines and focus on routes with the most attractive growth and profitability\ncharacteristics that are strategic in nature. For example, we formally exited the Western Canada market during Q3 2024,\nan intention we discussed on our Q2 earnings call. In Europe, our management team has taken several aggressive steps to\nimprove profitability. During Q3, we restructured our European operations which is expected to generate significant cost\nsavings and enable stronger organizational and commercial alignment with our local partner. As a result, we expect to see\nimprovement in profitability for Europe, which will mostly manifest itself during the busy summer months given the\nseasonality of the market.\nWe’ve also been laser-focused on maximizing cost efficiencies across Passenger with year-to-date Segment Adjusted\nSG&A falling approximately 6% compared to the same period in 2023.\nBlade's vertical transportation platform is now stronger than ever and well positioned for the transition to Electric Vertical\nAircraft, what we call EVA or eVTOL in industry parlance. This transition from conventional rotorcraft and seaplanes to EVA\nis now coming closer into focus following the FAA's recent release of the necessary guidelines for EVA operations as well\nas the incoming administration’s stated agenda of achieving adoption ahead of other countries.\nThe timing couldn’t be better for Blade. We’ve always said that our strategy is to create an urban air mobility platform that\ncan operate profitably at scale today, using conventional aircraft before the introduction of EVA, which we expect will lead\nto an abundance of conveniently located landing locations throughout all major metropolitan areas as well as lower costs of\noperation.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 2\nBlade Hamptons\nToday, we’ve achieved a key milestone with a Passenger Segment Adjusted EBITDA positive year for the twelve months\nending September 30, 2024 – over one full year earlier than expected. I couldn’t be more proud of the hard work from our\nteam to make this possible.\nOur Passenger business, given its captive infrastructure, proprietary technology, large flier base and strong brand, has never\nbeen more valuable to our customers and EVA manufacturers. Blade has only fortified its position as the largest operating\nvertical transportation company for commuters in the world, and we are without competitors for many of our key services.\nMedical Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved 15.1% in Q3 2024 versus the prior year period, with margins expanding\n70 basis points year over year despite a softer than expected quarter for US organ transplant volumes. We remain extremely\nbullish regarding the long term opportunities for our Medical business. The fundamental growth drivers of organ transplants\nin America continue to gain momentum as well as our ability to continue to gain market share. We’re seeing increased\nadoption of existing and rapidly emerging technologies to increase the supply of donor organs in the US including organ\nperfusion and preservation devices, procedures like Normothermic Regional Perfusion, or NRP, and a thriving industry of\ncompanies to provide the surgical staffing necessary for hospitals to increase recovery volumes.\nThis reinforces the validity of our strategy to remain agnostic as to the technologies, procedures and services embraced by\nour hospital partners and we welcome the opportunity to work directly with these innovative companies whenever the need\narises.\nTo that end, we’re excited to announce a strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to their metra perfusion\ndevice, which extends liver preservation times, aids in the identification of viable donor livers, enables longer-distance\ntransportation and increases the utilization of donor organs. OrganOx will preposition metra devices at strategic locations\nacross the United States, utilizing Blade's air and ground logistics to enable rapid deployment to transplant centers for on-\nground use. We know from speaking with our customers that demand for OrganOx’s metra device currently exceeds the\nsupply of available machines. This partnership will enable higher utilization of available devices through rapid distribution to\ncenters who need them on a case-by-case basis. As livers make up more than half of all heart, liver and lung transplants in\nthe US, increased access to this device could have a huge positive impact.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 3\nOur Medical platform continues to strengthen with 10 owned and 20 dedicated aircraft strategically positioned near our\ncustomers, a growing ground logistics capability with 9 hubs and 45 vehicles around the country and an organ placement\nservices offering (“TOPS”) that is gaining traction in the industry with five signed customers and a strong sales pipeline.\nLooking through the quarter to quarter volatility, our continued market share gains are highlighted in our performance and\nreinforce the strength of our platform. In the last two months we won competitive RFPs for two new high volume\ntransplant centers that we expect to begin flying in early 2025. Importantly, over the last year we have not lost a single\ncontracted customer, a testament to the service and value that we are providing.\nTurning to our Medical aircraft strategy, seven of the eight previously announced aircraft acquisitions were operational in\nthe quarter, with the eighth aircraft entering service in the last week of September after a significant entry into service delay.\nWe signed agreements to acquire two additional aircraft during Q3 that are expected to enter service by early 2025\nand increase our owned fleet size to ten aircraft. This strategy is already bearing fruit, enabling us to win new medical\ncontracts in recent months that required aircraft ownership. It’s important to note that at a fleet size of ten, our owned fleet\nwill only represent approximately one third of our Medical flying hours with the majority remaining on third-party aircraft.\nWe remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged,\nprioritizing low-risk, financially accretive investments in Medical aircraft and ground vehicles as well as bolt-on acquisitions\nin Medical that enhance our competitive posture or enableexpansion into other time critical logistics verticals that include\nindustrial manufacturing, parts for grounded aircraft or other medical cargo use cases. During Q3, we completed a tuck-in\nacquisition in Medical to geographically expand our captive network of ground vehicles. We will continue to weigh these\nacquisition priorities relative to opportunistic share repurchases.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 4\nBlade Airport – New York City\nFinancial Results and Outlook\nShort Distance revenue for Q3 2024 increased 6.5% year-over-year or 9.8% excluding Canada, as we formally exited\nthe Western Canada market at the end of August. In Jet and Other, revenues declined 15.0% year-over-year driven primarily\nby lower revenue per flight given softer jet charter industry pricing. We saw significant margin improvement in Passenger\nthis quarter as Passenger Flight Margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by approximately 700 basis points year-\nover-year. The profitability improvement in passenger was driven by several factors including strength in our Northeast\nLeisure routes, improved pricing, higher load factor in New York Airport transfers and early benefits from our\nEuropean restructuring.\nMedical revenue rose 7.8% year-over-year to $36.1 million. On a sequential basis, Medical revenue fell 5.9% versus Q2\n2024. Blade’s air trip volumes declined in line with industry heart, liver, lung transplant volumes in Q3 versus Q2 2024 though\nour sequential revenue decline was slightly higher than the industry given a reduction in empty-leg aircraft repositioning. As\nwe’ve increased the size of our dedicated aircraft fleet and based more aircraft at the home airports of our customers, we\nare able to significantly reduce empty aircraft repositioning time and costs, fortifying our value proposition to hospitals and\nmaking many other operators uncompetitive in these regions. This had a discrete impact on revenue in Q3, but is the right\ndecision for us and our customers. Long term this is a win-win, saving money for our customers, enabling shorter call-\nout times and longer trips, while at the same time these well-positioned dedicated aircraft generate more flight profit\ndollars per hour and per trip.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 5\nBlade Medical\nEven in Q3 2024, a quarter with unusually high owned aircraft related expenses and lower than expected volumes, we saw\na nearly 20% increase in flight profit per flight hour and an approximately 10% increase in average flight profit per air trip,\ndespite only a low-single digit increase in flight revenue per hour flown, which is consistent with our contractual annual\nescalators.\nMedical segment profitability metrics continued to improve on a year over year basis but declined sequentially in the quarter.\nMedical Flight Margin expanded 240 basis points year-over-year to 20.8% in Q3 2024 up from 18.4% in the year ago\nperiod. On a sequential basis, Medical Flight Margin declined by 280 basis points. Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin increased by 70 basis points year over year to 10.7% in Q3 2024 up from 10.0% in Q3 2023, but declined 370 basis\npoints sequentially.\nSeveral factors contributed to the sequential Medical margin decline in the quarter, the majority of which are timing related\nand set to improve from here. The lower revenue sequentially drove negative fixed cost leverage in the quarter. In addition,\nabove average maintenance downtime and owned fleet expenses also contributed to the sequential margin decline,\nincluding start-up costs and delays in aircraft onboarding for the owned fleet.\nThe good news is that we’ve seen a quick rebound in industry volumes and Medical segment revenue, and we expect\nto see a meaningful improvement in margins and our owned fleet performance in Q4 2024 relative to Q3 2024 driven by\nincreased volumes, a normalization in maintenance downtime, the entry into service of our eighth aircraft and a normalization\nof other owned fleet costs. This outlook is consistent with our actual financial performance in October.\nMoving forward, we think it’s reasonable to expect quarter to quarter variability in our Medical business given the non-linear\ngrowth of organ transplant volumes and our owned fleet that brings with it some unpredictability with respect to timing of\ncertain expenses and maintenance downtime.\nWe’d also like to highlight some data around an exciting industry trend poised to drive even faster growth in availability\nof donor organs: Normothermic Regional Perfusion. We’re seeing higher adoption of this technique which improves\ntransplant outcomes and yields, meaning the total number of usable organs recovered from one donor, in recoveries from\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 6\nBlade Europe – Monaco\ndonors who have undergone cardiac death. Hospitals and Organ Procurement Organizations can often utilize off-the-shelf\nequipment to perform this technique at low cost and we’ve seen a more than threefold increase in the number of NRP\nrecoveries performed by our transplant center customers year-to-date in 2024 versus 2023. NRP is still a low-single digit\npercentage of our total recoveries and, based on conversations with our customers, we believe it is still early days for this\nexciting growth driver.\nWe continue to focus on controlling Unallocated Corporate Expenses and Software Development, which declined\n1.3% year over year in Q3 2024 and shrunk 50 basis points as a percentage of revenues to 7%. On the cash flow front, the\ndifference between our Adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million and cash from operations of $6.4 million in the quarter was primarily\ndriven by a cash inflow from working capital.\nOur capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized software development costs, were $9.9 million in the quarter and driven\nprimarily by $7.3 million of aircraft acquisition payments, while capitalized aircraft maintenance was approximately $900\nthousand. This aircraft acquisition amount includes payments for our eighth aircraft, delivered in the last week of the quarter,\nalong with two additional aircraft that we purchased during the quarter, but did not begin flying. We have approximately $1.9\nmillion of remaining payments on the ten aircraft that we expect to pay in Q4 2024. Beyond the ten aircraft acquisitions\npreviously discussed, we do not have any other aircraft purchases in process currently and our focus right now is on\nonboarding the final two planes and optimizing the financial performance of the current fleet. However, given the significant\nstrategic and financial benefits of our owned aircraft, we will opportunistically consider adding a low single digit number of\nsimilarly priced aircraft to the fleet over the next 9 to 12 months.\nWe ended the quarter with no debt and $136.3 million of cash and short-term investments, providing flexibility for\nstrategic investments in aircraft, acquisitions in Medical and opportunistic share repurchases.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 7\nConclusion\nIn summary, we are pleased to have achieved such an important milestone by achieving full-year Passenger Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA profitability a year ahead of our guidance. We remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders\nthrough disciplined execution towards our financial and operational targets in the quarters ahead.\nThank you all for your continued support.\nSincerely,\nRob Wiesenthal\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 8\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nBlade believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (\"GAAP\") results, provide useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall\nunderstanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in\nits financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by\nother companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses, SG&A, Adjusted SG&A, Flight Profit, Flight Margin, Free Cash Flow and\nFree Cash Flow before Aircraft Acquisitions have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables within this press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA – Blade reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Blade defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude\ndepreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income and expense, income tax, realized\ngains and losses on short-term investments, impairment of intangible assets and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are\nindicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\nAdjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses – Blade defines Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses as expenses that cannot be allocated to either of\nour reporting segments (Passenger and Medical) and therefore attributable to our Corporate expenses and software development, less non-cash items\nand certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the\ncomparability of results between periods.\nSG&A and Adjusted SG&A – Blade defines SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue. Blade defines Adjusted SG&A as total operating\nexpenses excluding cost of revenue and excluding non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative\nof ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\nFlight Profit and Flight Margin – Blade defines Flight Profit as revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of\naircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ\nground transportation revenue using the Company’s owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to\nthe operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries. Blade defines Flight Margin for a period as Flight Profit for the period divided by revenue for the same\nperiod. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide an important measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations,\nas they focus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with those operations such as third party variable costs and costs of owning and\noperating Blade's owned aircraft.\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions – Blade defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities\nless capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Blade also reports Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is Free Cash\nFlow excluding cash outflows for aircraft acquisitions. Blade believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow before Aircraft Acquisitions provide important\ninsights into the cash-generating capability of the business, with Free Cash Flow before Aircraft Acquisition specifically highlighting the cash generated by\nour core operations before the impact of discretionary strategic investments in new aircraft.\nQ3 2024 Investor Update | 9\nFinancial

Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nNote 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nDescription of Business\n\nBlade Air Mobility, Inc. (“Blade” or the “Company”) provides air transportation and logistics for hospitals across the United States, where it is one of the largest transporters of human organs for transplant, and for passengers, with helicopter and fixed wing services primarily in the Northeast United States and Southern Europe. Based in New York City, Blade's asset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to facilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft (“EVA” or “eVTOL”), enabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free. \n\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Management’s opinion is that all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nShort-Term Investments\n\nHeld-to-Maturity Securities\n\nThe Company's investments in held-to-maturity securities consist of investment grade U.S. Treasury obligations with maturity dates of less than 365 days. The Company has the ability and intention to hold these securities until maturity. Accordingly, these securities are recorded in the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost and interest is recorded within interest income on the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations. The held-to-maturity securities balance and fair market value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $116,310 and $116,509, and $138,264 and $138,285, respectively. The fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair market value is Level 2. See Note 13 – Fair Value Measurements for additional information. \n\nSoftware Development Costs\n\nThe Company incurs costs related to the development of its technology stack. The costs consist of personnel costs (including related benefits and stock-based compensation) and external vendor costs incurred during the development stage. Capitalization of costs begins when two criteria are met: (1) the preliminary project stage is completed, and (2) it is probable that the software will be completed and used for its intended function. Capitalization ceases when the project is substantially complete and the developed features are ready for their intended use, including the completion of all significant testing. Costs related to preliminary project activities, post implementation operating activities and system maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n\nCapitalized costs are included in intangible assets and amortized over three years, on a straight-line basis, which represents the manner in which the expected benefit will be derived. The amortization of capitalized software development costs are recorded within software development expense in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n\nConcentrations\n\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consists principally of cash amounts on deposit with financial institutions. At times, the Company’s cash in banks is in excess of the Federal Deposit \n\nInsurance corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits.\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nMajor Customers\n\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 or as of December 31, 2023.\n\nMajor Vendors\n\nOne vendor accounted for 12% of the Company’s purchases from operating vendors for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Two vendors accounted for 14% and 12%, respectively, of the Company’s purchases from operating vendors for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOne vendor accounted for 11% of the Company’s purchases from operating vendors for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Two vendors accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s purchases from operating vendors for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOne vendor accounted for 12% of the Company’s outstanding accounts payable as of September 30, 2024. Two vendors accounted for 17% and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding accounts payable as of December 31, 2023. \n\nProperty and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Residual values estimated for aircraft are approximately 10% of the original purchase price. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized, and maintenance and repair are expensed as incurred (see below for further information). Leasehold improvements depreciation is computed over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.\n\nDuring the period from April 1, 2024 through May 2, 2024, Blade completed the acquisition of seven aircraft (“Acquired Aircraft”) from M&N Equipment, LLC (“M&N”), Atlas Jet, Inc and Aviation Bridge, LLC for a combined purchase price of approximately $17,621. The funding for these acquisitions involved the utilization of $9,269 from existing prepaid deposits under existing Capacity Purchase Agreements (“CPAs”) with M&N which were refunded to Blade and applied to the purchase, $5,489 in cash and the remaining amount payable was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which were subject to traditional closing conditions, inspections, holdbacks and adjustments. Blade intends to utilize the Acquired Aircraft, which were previously dedicated to Blade under existing CPAs (see Note 5 for further information on CPAs) to support its Medical segment and the Acquired Aircraft will continue to be operated by the same operator.\n\nIn August and September 2024, Blade purchased three additional aircraft for a combined purchase price of $7,388. All of the aircraft acquired by Blade are dedicated to Blade's Medical segment. \n\nUseful Life (in years)| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---|---  \nAircraft, engines and related rotable parts (1)| 2 - 20| $| 25,944 | $| —  \nFurniture and fixtures (2)| 5| 2,222 | 886  \nTechnology equipment (2)| 3| 569 | 402  \nLeasehold improvements (2)| Shorter of useful life or life of lease| 3,539 | 3,016  \nVehicles (1)| 5| 2,673 | 1,750  \nTotal property and equipment, gross| 34,947 | 6,054  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation| (4,397)| (3,155)  \nTotal property and equipment, net| $| 30,550 | $| 2,899  \n  \n(1) Depreciation expense is included within cost of revenue.\n\n(2) Depreciation expense is included within general and administrative expenses.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded depreciation expense for property and equipment of $815 and $302, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded depreciation expense for property and equipment of $2,003 and $802, respectively. \n\nAircraft Maintenance and Repairs\n\nUnscheduled aircraft maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, scheduled maintenance and repairs occurring at intervals of two or more years are capitalized and amortized over the period between these intervals.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Company assesses long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”). Long-lived assets, except for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, consist of property and equipment and finite-lived acquired intangible assets, such as exclusive rights to air transportation services, customer lists and trademarks. Long-lived assets, except for goodwill and indefinite intangible assets, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances arise, the Company compares the carrying amount of the long-lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets. If the estimated aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived assets, an impairment charge, calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, is recorded. The fair value of the long-lived assets is determined through various valuation techniques, including estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset and pricing information on comparable market transactions, unless another method provides a more reliable estimate. If an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of a long-lived asset is recognized as a new cost basis of the impaired asset. Impairment loss is not reversed even if fair value exceeds carrying amount in subsequent periods.\n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5,759 related to the exclusive rights to air transportation services associated with Blade Canada. The charge brought the net book value of the exclusive rights to zero. This amount is included within general and administrative expenses in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and is part of the Passenger segment. The impairment resulted from a modification to the November 30, 2021 agreement with Helijet, effective June 1, 2024, which included an earlier termination date of August 31, 2025 (previously an initial term of five years with automatic renewals for successive two-year periods). During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, the termination date was furthered modified to be August 31, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the remaining exclusive rights to air transportation services intangible asset balance is $3,745, which relates to the air transportation rights associated with the acquisition of Blade Europe. This amount is included in the Intangibles assets, net line item on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet.\n\nEmerging Growth Company\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected to use such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s consolidated financial statements with another public company that is not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current business factors, and various other assumptions that the Company believes are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company is subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in the Company’s business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment evolves.\n\nChanges in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Significant estimates and assumptions by management include, but are not limited to, the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill, the determination of whether a contract contains a lease, the allocation of consideration between lease and non-lease components, the determination of incremental borrowing rates for leases and the provision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Adopted\n\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements. The new guidance clarifies or improves disclosure and presentation requirements on a variety of topics in the codification. The amendments in the update are intended to align the requirements in the FASB ASC with the SEC’s regulations. The amendments are effective prospectively on the date each individual amendment is effectively removed from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, or if the SEC has not removed the requirements by June 30, 2027, this amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not become effective for any entity. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands the segment disclosures of public entities. This expansion includes the requirement to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and are included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. Additionally, the ASU mandates the disclosure of the amount and description of the composition of other segment items, as well as interim disclosures of a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets. These disclosure requirements apply to public entities with a single reportable segment as well. The ASU will be effective for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and early adoption is allowed. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made \n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\navailable for issuance. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02, Codification Improvements - Amendments to Remove References to the Concept Statements. This ASU amends the Codification to remove references to various concepts statements and impacts a variety of topics in the Codification. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance. Generally, the amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended to result in significant accounting changes for most entities. ASU 2024-02 is effective January 1, 2025. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the SEC have not had, or are not anticipated to have, a significant effect on the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, both present and future.\n\nNote 2 – Revenue\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nBlade operates in three key product lines across two segments (see Note 7 for further information on reportable segments):\n\nPassenger segment\n\n•Short Distance – Consisting primarily of helicopter and amphibious seaplane flights in the United States and Europe between 10 and 100 miles in distance. Flights are available for purchase both by-the-seat and on a full aircraft charter basis. Short Distance products are typically purchased using the Blade App and paid for principally via credit card transactions, wire, check, customer credit, and gift cards, with payments principally collected by the Company in advance of the performance of related services, with the exception of Europe where institutional clients pay after the performance of related services under payment terms. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed.\n\n•Jet and Other – Consists principally of revenues from non-medical jet charter and by-the-seat jet flights between New York and South Florida (discontinued in November 2023), revenue from brand partners for exposure to Blade fliers and certain ground transportation services. Jet products are typically purchased through our Flier Relations associates and our app and are paid for principally via checks, wires and credit card. Jet payments are typically collected at the time of booking before the performance of the related service. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed. \n\nMedical segment\n\n•MediMobility Organ Transport – Consisting primarily of transportation of human organs for transplant and/or the medical teams supporting these services. Blade also offers additional services including donor logistics coordination and support evaluating potential donor organs. MediMobility Organ Transport products are typically purchased through our medical logistics coordinators and are paid for principally via checks and wires. Payments are generally collected after the performance of the related service in accordance with the client's payment terms. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed. \n\nThe Company initially records advance payments for passenger flights in deferred revenue, deferring revenue recognition until the travel occurs. Deferred revenue from advance payments, customer credit and gift card purchases is recognized as revenue when a flight is flown. Deferred revenue from the Company’s passes is recognized ratably over the term of the pass. For travel that has more than one flight segment, the Company deems each segment as a separate performance obligation and recognizes revenue for each segment as travel occurs. Fees charged in association with add-on services, changes or extensions to non-refundable seats sold are considered part of the Company's passenger performance obligation. As such, those fees are deferred at the time of collection and recognized at the time the travel is provided.\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nDisaggregated Revenue\n\nDisaggregated revenue by product line and segment was as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nPassenger Segment  \nShort Distance| $| 32,352 | $| 30,388 | $| 63,070 | $| 59,997  \nJet and Other| 6,463 | 7,607 | 20,837 | 23,092  \nTotal| $| 38,815 | $| 37,995 | $| 83,907 | $| 83,089  \nMedical Segment  \nMediMobility Organ Transport| $| 36,062 | $| 33,447 | $| 110,429 | $| 94,613  \nTotal| $| 36,062 | $| 33,447 | $| 110,429 | $| 94,613  \nTotal Revenue| $| 74,877 | $| 71,442 | $| 194,336 | $| 177,702  \n  \nContract Liabilities\n\nContract liabilities are defined as entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's contract liability balance is $6,681 and $6,845 respectively, and is recorded as deferred revenue on its unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. This balance consists of payments from customers received in advance of the actual flight, prepaid monthly and annual flight passes, customer credits for flight reservations that were cancelled for good reason by the customer, and prepaid gift card obligations. The customer has one year to use the credit as payment for a future flight with the Company.

The Company collects these fees and remits them to the appropriate government agency. These fees are excluded from revenue.\n\nThe Company’s quarterly financial data is subject to seasonal fluctuations.

(“CJK”) for a total purchase price of $2,230 in cash. CJK specializes in providing physicians and organs ground transportation services in the New York Tri-State area. This acquisition further expands Blade’s MediMobility presence in this key market. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constituted a business in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Acquisition-related costs totaling $37 were expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The results of CJK from September 26, 2024 (“acquisition date”) to September 30, 2024 were not significant, and have been included in the Medical segment.\n\nNet Assets Acquired\n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date on a preliminary basis and changes to these allocations may occur as additional information becomes available during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). At acquisition, the Company recognized goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, totaling $2,212. The primary components of goodwill include operational synergies, service expansion in the New York Tri-State area, and the value attributed to key personnel relationships contributing to customer retention. The acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis as follows:\n\nProperty and equipment, net| 18  \n---|---  \nOperating right-of-use asset| 137  \nTotal identifiable assets acquired| 155  \nOperating lease liability| 137  \nTotal liabilities assumed| 137  \nNet assets acquired| 18  \nGoodwill| 2,212  \nTotal consideration| $| 2,230  \n  \nThe pro forma impact of the acquisition was not material to our historical unaudited interim condensed consolidated operating results and is therefore not presented.\n\nNote 4 – Goodwill\n\nThe changes in the carrying value of goodwill are as follows:\n\nGoodwill balance, December 31, 2023| $| 40,373  \n---|---|---  \nAdditions (1)| 2,212  \nForeign currency translation| 367  \nGoodwill balance, September 30, 2024| $| 42,952  \n  \n(1) Additions represent goodwill associated with the acquisition of CJK. See Note 3 for additional information.\n\nNote 5 – Operating Right-of-Use Asset and Operating Lease Liability\n\nBlade’s operating leases consist of airport and heliport terminals, offices, vehicles and aircraft leases that are embedded within certain CPAs. Upon meeting certain criteria as stated in ASC 842 Leases (“ASC 842”), the lease component of a CPA would be accounted for as an embedded lease, with a corresponding balance included in the operating right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability.\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had the following lease transactions in accordance with ASC 842:\n\nEffective in July 2024, Blade entered into two agreements with separate operators for up to a 15-month term ending October 2025 for two aircraft. Under these CPAs, if the agreement expires or is terminated for cause, the flight hour guarantee will be pro-rated to the date of the termination. Additionally, Blade has the right for immediate termination with no penalty if a government authority enacts travel restrictions.\n\nAn existing CPA for eight aircraft utilized by our Medical segment, was restated and amended in January 2024 for a four-year term ending November 30, 2027. Subsequently, this agreement was terminated in April 2024 for seven aircraft after Blade’s acquisition of those seven aircraft(see  “—Property and Equipment, Net” within Note 1). The CPA for the eighth aircraft was terminated in July 2024. \n\nAn existing three aircraft CPA agreement was expanded on May 1, 2024 when a fourth aircraft commenced operations. The four aircraft are rotorcraft utilized by both our Passenger and Medical segment. In case of early termination by Blade, a one-year purchase guarantee will be pro-rated to the date of the termination. In addition, Blade has the right for immediate termination with no penalty if a government authority enacts travel restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for new office spaces. This includes a lease at 4100 W. Galveston Street, Chandler, Arizona with an initial term of approximately 7 years commencing in July 2024 which serves the Medical segment. A new lease at 35 Hudson Yards in New York, New York with an initial term of approximately 3 years commenced in May 2024 and serves the Passenger segment and as Blade’s corporate office. \n\nSee Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies”, for additional information about our capacity purchase agreements.\n\nBalance sheet information related to the Company’s leases is presented below:\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nOperating leases:  \nOperating right-of-use asset| $| 22,813 | $| 23,484  \nOperating lease liability, current| 4,472 | 4,787  \nOperating lease liability, long-term| 19,271 | 19,738  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, included in the table above is $16,857, $2,900 and $14,718 of operating right-of-use asset, operating lease liability, current, and operating lease liability, long-term, respectively, under aircraft leases that are embedded within the capacity purchase agreements.

The 2021 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Awards granted under the 2021 Plan are subject to individual award agreements that, among other things, specify the conditions for vesting, termination and forfeiture. The requisite vesting periods for time-based awards made to date range from vesting on grant date to as late as four years from the date of grant. The expiration date of the 2021 Plan, on and after which date no awards may be granted under the 2021 Plan, is May 7, 2031 (the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the 2021 Plan); provided, however, that such expiration shall not affect awards then outstanding under the 2021 Plan, and the terms and conditions of the 2021 Plan shall continue to apply to such awards.\n\nThe number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan (the “Absolute Share Limit”) automatically increases on the first day of each fiscal year by the lesser of (a) 4,653,484 shares of common stock, (b) 5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last year of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (c) a lower number of shares of common stock as determined by our Board of Directors.

In addition, per ASC 280, Segment Reporting, paragraph 280-10-50-11, two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single reportable segment if the segments have similar economic characteristics. The Company has identified two reportable segments - Passenger and Medical, as our Chief Executive Officer, who is our CODM, regularly reviews discrete information for those two reportable segments. The Passenger segment consists of our two product lines Short Distance and Jet and Other. The Medical segment consists of the MediMobility Organ Transport product line. Our product lines are defined in Note 2 — Revenue.\n\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, the Company changed its primary measure of segment performance to Adjusted EBITDA, as the CODM evaluates the performance of the segments and allocates resources primarily based on their respective Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the operational efficiency and core results of our segment, independent of tax implications and non-operational financial factors. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, (4) interest income and expense, (5) income tax, (6) realized gains and losses on short-term investments, (7) impairment of intangible assets and (8) certain other non-recurring items (shown below) that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods. \n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nThe following tables reflect certain financial data of the Company’s reportable segments:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nSegment revenue  \nPassenger| $| 38,815 | $| 37,995 | $| 83,907 | $| 83,089  \nMedical| 36,062 | 33,447 | 110,429 | 94,613  \nTotal revenue| $| 74,877 | $| 71,442 | $| 194,336 | $| 177,702  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA  \nPassenger| $| 5,593 | $| 2,777 | $| 3,724 | $| (2,353)  \nMedical| 3,851 | 3,346 | 13,784 | 8,249  \nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA| 9,444 | 6,123 | 17,508 | 5,896  \nReconciling items:  \nAdjusted unallocated corporate expenses and software development (1)| (5,264)| (5,336)| (15,916)| (17,281)  \nDepreciation and amortization| (1,279)| (1,843)| (4,432)| (5,305)  \nStock-based compensation| (5,345)| (3,330)| (15,434)| (9,348)  \nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities| (299)| 5,719 | 2,266 | 3,823  \nRealized loss from sales of short-term investments| — | — | — | (95)  \nInterest income| 1,764 | 2,147 | 5,624 | 6,178  \nLegal and regulatory advocacy fees (2)(3)| (165)| (217)| (427)| (640)  \nExecutive severance costs| (140)| — | (140)| (265)  \nSOX readiness costs| (220)| (145)| (302)| (180)  \nContingent consideration compensation (earn-out) (4)| — | (2,700)| — | (5,361)  \nM&A transaction costs| (85)| — | (169)| —  \nImpairment of intangible assets| — | — | (5,759)| —  \nRestructuring costs - Blade Europe (5)| (483)| — | (483)| —  \n(Loss) income before income taxes| $| (2,072)| $| 418 | $| (17,664)| $| (22,578)  \n  \n(1) Includes costs that are not directly attributable to reportable segments such as finance, accounting, tax, information technology, human resources, legal costs and software development costs (primarily consists of staff and contractors costs), and excludes non-cash items and certain transactions that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations. \n\n(2) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents legal advocacy fees related to the Drulias lawsuit (see “— Legal and Environmental” within Note 11) that we do not consider representative of legal and regulatory advocacy costs that we will incur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. \n\n(3) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents certain legal and regulatory advocacy fees for certain proposed restrictions at East Hampton Airport and potential operational restrictions on large jet aircraft at Westchester Airport, that we do not consider representative of legal and regulatory advocacy costs that we will incur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. \n\n(4) Trinity’s contingent consideration, 2023 was the last year subject to an earn-out payment.\n\n(5) Includes severance, retention, legal and other one-time restructuring costs associated with a reorganization of Blade Europe.\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nGoodwill  \nPassenger| $| 27,412 | $| 27,045  \nMedical| 15,540 | 13,328  \nTotal goodwill| $| 42,952 | $| 40,373  \n  \n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nGeographic Information\n\nRevenue by geography is based on where the flight’s operator is based.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income tax benefit was $150and$443, respectively. The tax benefit in the 2024 period is attributable to Blade Monaco. The difference in the tax benefit in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period is attributable to the mix of pretax profits from foreign operations and the mix of tax rates in those jurisdictions, while no offsetting tax benefits arising from the Company’s U.S., Canada and France net operating losses.\n\nNote 9 – Net (Loss) Income per Common Share\n\nBasic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the impact of common shares, if dilutive, resulting from the exercise of outstanding stock options, restricted shares, and warrants.\n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nA reconciliation of net loss and common share amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted loss per common share is presented below.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nBasic and dilutive loss per common share:  \nNet loss attributable to Blade Air Mobility, Inc.| $| (1,954)| $| 289 | $| (17,514)| $| (22,135)  \nLess: Undistributed earnings allocated to nonvested restricted stockholders| — | (22)| — | —  \nBasic net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders| (1,954)| 267 | (17,514)| (22,135)  \nAdd: Undistributed earnings allocated to nonvested restricted stockholders| — | 22 | — | —  \nLess: Reallocation of undistributed loss to nonvested restricted stockholders| — | (20)| — | —  \nDiluted net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders| $| (1,954)| $| 269 | $| (17,514)| $| (22,135)  \nTotal weighted-average basic common shares outstanding| 78,044,254 | 74,139,422 | 77,151,361 | 73,108,263  \nEffect of dilutive securities:  \nStock options| — | 6,867,437 | — | —  \nTotal effect of dilutive securities| — | 6,867,437 | — | —  \nTotal weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding| 78,044,254 | 81,006,859 | 77,151,361 | 73,108,263  \nNet (loss) income per common share:  \nBasic (loss) earnings per common share| $| (0.03)| $| — | $| (0.23)| $| (0.30)  \nDilutive (loss) earnings per common share| $| (0.03)| $| — | $| (0.23)| $| (0.30)  \n  \nThe following table represents common stock equivalents that were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 because the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive: \n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nWarrants to purchase shares of common stock| 14,166,644 | 14,166,644 | 14,166,644 | 14,166,644  \nOptions to purchase shares of common stock| 6,526,611 | — | 6,526,611 | 7,255,851  \nRestricted shares of common stock| 10,112,365 | 5,278,448 | 10,112,365 | 6,108,798  \nTotal potentially dilutive securities| 30,805,620 | 19,445,092 | 30,805,620 | 27,531,293  \n  \nNote 10 – Related Party Transactions\n\nThe Company occasionally engages in transactions for certain air charter services with jet operators who are part of the portfolio of RedBird Capital Partners Management LLC, which is an investor in the Company. Additionally, one member of the Company’s Board is a Partner of an affiliated company of RedBird Capital Partners Management LLC. \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid these jet operators approximately $96 and $100, respectively for air charter services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid these jet operators approximately $273 and $287, respectively for air charter services. These costs were recorded within Cost of revenue on the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nNote 11 – Commitments and Contingencies\n\nCapacity Purchase Agreements\n\nBlade has contractual relationships with various aircraft operators to provide aircraft service. Under these CPAs, the Company pays the operator contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights. The fees are generally based on fixed hourly rates for flight time multiplied by hours flown. Under these CPAs, the Company is also responsible for landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the operator to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has remaining unfulfilled obligations under agreements with various aircraft operators to provide aircraft service. The remaining unfulfilled obligation includes amounts within operating lease liability related to aircraft leases embedded within our capacity purchase agreements as discussed in Note 5 – Operating Right-of-Use Asset and Operating Lease Liability. These future unfulfilled obligations were as follows:\n\nFor the Year Ended December 31| Total Unfulfilled Obligation|  Immediate Termination (1)| Termination for Convenience (2)  \n---|---|---|---  \nRemainder of 2024| $| 2,402 | $| 176 | $| —  \n2025| 15,378 | 8,740 | 2,835  \n2026| 12,055 | 5,417 | —  \n2027| 9,234 | 2,596 | —  \n2028| 6,638 | — | —  \n2029 - 2032 (each year)| 6,638 | — | —  \n  \n(1) Within total unfulfilled obligation, the following amounts are where Blade has the ability for immediate termination if a government authority enacts travel restrictions.\n\n(2) Within total unfulfilled obligation, the following amounts are where Blade could terminate for convenience upon 60 days’ notice, with a one-year annual minimum guarantee being pro-rated as of the termination date.\n\nLegal and Environmental\n\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business. Other than described below, we do not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, management believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the information currently available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of these other litigation and claims will not materially affect the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. These amounts are recorded based on the Company's assessments of the likelihood of their eventual disposition.\n\nIn February 2024, two putative class action lawsuits relating to the acquisition of Blade Urban Air Mobility, Inc. (“Old Blade”) were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On April 16, 2024, these cases were consolidated under the caption Drulias et al. v. Affeldt, et al., C.A. No. 2024-0161-SG (Del. Ch.) (“Drulias”). Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against the former directors of Experience Investment Corp. (“EIC” and such directors, the “EIC Directors”), the former officers of EIC, and Experience Sponsor LLC (“Sponsor”), and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claim against Sponsor. The operative complaint alleges, amongst other things, that the proxy statement related to the acquisition of Old Blade insufficiently disclosed EIC’s cash position, Old Blade’s value prospects and risks, and information related to Old Blade’s chief executive officer, who is also our current chief executive officer. The consolidated complaints seeks, among other things, damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. Litigation is ongoing. The Company believes that all claims in the lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against them. \n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nNon-Cancellable Commitments with Vendors\n\nIn December 2023, the Company entered into a technology service agreement with a vendor for cloud computing services where we are committed to the remaining spend of $0.1 million, $1.1 million and $1.6 million for the years ending December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nNote 12 – Warrant Liabilities\n\nOn May 7, 2021, the merger between Old Blade and EIC was consummated (the “Merger”). The warrants acquired in the Merger include (a) redeemable warrants issued by EIC and sold as part of the units in the EIC Initial Public Offering (“EIC IPO”) (whether they were purchased in the EIC IPO or thereafter in the open market), which are exercisable for an aggregate of 9,166,644 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $11.50 per share (the “Public Warrants”) and (b) warrants issued by EIC to Sponsor in a private placement simultaneously with the closing of the EIC IPO, which are exercisable for an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $11.50 per share (the “Private Placement Warrants”).\n\nThe Company evaluated its warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity. Accordingly, the Company classifies the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations. See Note 13 – Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\n\nWarrants — Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. The Public Warrants became exercisable on June 7, 2021. The Public Warrants will expire on May 7, 2026 or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\nRedemptions of Warrants for Cash — The Company may redeem the Public Warrants:\n\n•in whole and not in part;\n\n•at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n\n•upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and\n\n•if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to each warrant holder.\n\nRedemption of Warrants for Shares of Common Stock — The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n\n•in whole and not in part;\n\n•at a price equal to a number of shares of common stock to be determined, based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock;\n\n•upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption;\n\n•if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and the like) on the trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and\n\n•if, and only if, there is an effective registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating thereto is available throughout the 30-day period after the written notice of redemption is given.\n\nIf the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption for cash, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis”, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net-cash settle the warrants.\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the initial public offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees (unless the Company’s common stock equals or exceed $10 per share and the Company redeems all the Public Warrants). If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\n\nNote 13 – Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs based on management’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value.\n\nLevel| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nWarrant liabilities - Public Warrants| 1| $| 1,742 | $| 3,208  \nWarrant liabilities - Private Warrants| 2| 950 | 1,750  \nFair value of aggregate warrant liabilities| $| 2,692 | $| 4,958  \n  \nThe Warrants were accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within “Warrant liability” on the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value upon assumption and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within “Change in fair value of warrant liabilities” in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe Public Warrants are considered part of Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as those securities are traded on an active public market. At May 7, 2021 and thereafter, the Company valued the Private Warrants using Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company used the value of the Public Warrants as an approximation of the value of the Private Warrants as they are substantially similar to the Public Warrants, but not directly traded or quoted on an active market.\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\n\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\n\nSubsequent Measurement\n\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities:PublicWarrants| Private PlacementWarrants| Total WarrantLiability  \n---|---|---  \nFair value as of January 1, 2024| $| 3,208 | $| 1,750 | $| 4,958  \nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities| (1,466)| (800)| (2,266)  \nFair value as of September 30, 2024| $| 1,742 | $| 950 | $| 2,692  \n  \nNote 14 – Stockholders' Equity\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company is authorized to provide, out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock, for one or more series of Preferred Stock and, with respect to each such series, to fix, without further stockholder approval, the number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such series, the powers (including voting powers), preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of such series of Preferred Stock. The powers (including voting powers), preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of each series of Preferred Stock, if any, may differ from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. There was no preferred stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n\nShare Repurchase Program\n\nOn March 20, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company may repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $20.0 million of the Company's common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases. The Company’s stock repurchase programs may be suspended, modified or discontinued by the Board at any time without prior notice at the Company's discretion. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and the Board’s (or its designees’) determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 80,102 shares of common stock in the open market. The average price per share was $3.00, resulting in a total aggregate amount of approximately $244. All share repurchases have been retired. There remains a potential repurchase capacity of approximately $19.8 million under the stock repurchase program that was announced on March 20, 2024.\n\nThe Company follows the cost method for accounting for stock repurchases. All shares repurchased to date have been retired by the Company, and there were no unsettled share repurchases. When the Company retires its own common stock, the excess of the repurchase price over par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings subject to certain limitations. The allocation to additional paid-in capital is determined by applying a percentage, calculated by dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares issued and outstanding as of the retirement date, to the balance of additional paid-in capital as of the retirement date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $163 was deducted from accumulated deficit, and $407 was deducted from additional paid-in capital, in relation to the retirement of the common stock.\n\nNote 15 – Subsequent Events \n\nThe Company has completed an evaluation of all subsequent events through the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to ensure that these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include appropriate disclosure of events both recognized in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and events which occurred but were not recognized in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has concluded that no subsequent event has occurred that requires disclosure.\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nItem 2. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\nIn addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(“Blade” or the “Company”) provides air transportation and logistics for hospitals across the United States, where it is one of the largest transporters of human organs for transplant, and for passengers, with helicopter and fixed wing services primarily in the Northeast United States and Southern Europe. Based in New York City, Blade's asset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to facilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft (“EVA” or “eVTOL”), enabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free. \n\nBlade operates in three key product lines across two segments (see Note 7 to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information on reportable segments):\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nPassenger segment\n\n•Short Distance – Consisting primarily of helicopter and amphibious seaplane flights in the United States and Europe between 10 and 100 miles in distance. Flights are available for purchase both by-the-seat and on a full aircraft charter basis.\n\n•Jet and Other – Consists principally of revenues from non-medical jet charter and by-the-seat jet flights between New York and South Florida (discontinued in November 2023), revenue from brand partners for exposure to Blade fliers and certain ground transportation services.\n\nMedical segment\n\n•MediMobility Organ Transport – Consisting primarily of transportation of human organs for transplant and/or the medical teams supporting these services. Blade also offers additional services including donor logistics coordination and support evaluating potential donor organs through Trinity Organ Placement Services (“TOPS”), launched at the end of 2023.\n\nSeats Flown \n\nThe following table reflects the key operating metric we use to evaluate the Passenger segment:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nSeats flown – all passenger flights| 45,977 | 50,821 | 117,722 | 121,008   \n  \nWe define “Seats flown — all passenger flights” (Seats Flown) as the total number of seats purchased by paying passengers on all flights, whether sold by-the-seat or within a charter arrangement. Our long-term consumer-facing strategy is primarily focused on growth in by-the-seat products, and we believe that Seats Flown is an important indicator of our progress in executing on this growth strategy. This metric is not always directly correlated with revenue given the significant variability in the price we charge per seat flown across our various products and routes. For products and routes sold by-the-seat, we fly significantly more passengers at a low price per seat; which is captured by Seats Flown. Passenger revenue is heavily influenced by the Jet and Other product lines where we typically fly fewer passengers over long distances at a high price. We believe the Seats Flown metric is useful to investors in understanding the overall scale of our Passenger segment and trends in the number of passengers paying to use our service.\n\nThe Activity in Canada ended on August 31, 2024. As a result, the three- and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024, and 2023 included two and eight months, and three and nine months, respectively, of Seats Flown activity in Canada.\n\nOur Business Model\n\nBlade leverages an asset-light business model: we primarily utilize aircraft that are owned and/or operated by third-parties on Blade’s behalf. In these arrangements, pilots, maintenance, hangar, insurance, and fuel are all costs borne by our network of operators, which provide aircraft flight time to Blade at fixed hourly rates. This enables our operator partners to focus on training pilots, maintaining aircraft and flying, while we maintain the relationship with our customer from booking through flight arrival. For flights offered for sale by-the-seat, Blade schedules flights based on demand analysis and takes the economic risk of aggregating fliers to optimize flight profitability, providing predictable margins for our operators.\n\nWhen utilizing third-party aircraft and/or aircraft operators, we typically pre-negotiate fixed hourly rates and flight times, paying only for flights actually flown, creating a predictable and flexible cost structure. Blade provides guaranteed flight commitments to some of our third-party operators through capacity purchase agreements, which enable Blade to ensure dedicated access to such aircraft with enhanced crew availability, lower costs and, in many cases, the ability to unlock more favorable rates when flying more than the minimum number of hours we guarantee to the operator. Additionally, a significant portion of Blade trips are flown by safety-vetted operators to whom Blade makes no commitments, providing us with additional flexible capacity for high demand periods. \n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nWe also own a small number of fixed wing aircraft, operated and maintained by a third-party, that we utilize primarily for the Medical segment. We prioritize the use of owned aircraft and dedicated aircraft under capacity purchase agreements, which provide better economies of scale. We size our owned fleet and our commitments under capacity purchase agreements significantly below our expected demand, enabling us to maximize utilization on those aircraft while fulfilling incremental demand through our network of non-dedicated operators. \n\nBlade’s proprietary “customer-to-cockpit” technology stack enables us to manage fliers and organ transports across numerous simultaneous flights with multiple operators around the world. We believe that this technology, which provides (i) real-time tracking of organ transports and passenger flights; (ii) profit/loss information on a flight-by-flight basis; (iii) customized portals for all relevant parties including pilots, accounting teams, operator dispatch, transplant coordinators and Blade’s logistics team; and (iv) a customer-facing app for passenger missions, will enable us to continue to scale our business. This technology stack was built with future growth in mind and is designed to allow our platform to be easily scaled to accommodate, among other things, rapid increases in volume, new routes, new operators, broader flight schedules, international expansion, next-generation verticraft and ancillary services (e.g., last/first-mile ground connections, trip cancellation insurance, baggage delivery) through our mobile apps, website and cloud-based tools.\n\nOur asset-light business model was developed to be scalable and profitable using conventional aircraft today while enabling a seamless transition to EVA, once they are certified for public use. We intend to leverage the expected lower operating costs of EVA versus helicopters to reduce the consumer’s price for our flights. Additionally, we expect the reduced noise footprint and zero carbon emission characteristics of EVA to allow for the development of new, vertical landing infrastructure (“vertiports”) in our existing and new markets.\n\nFactors Affecting our Performance\n\nAbility to attract and retain fliers in our Short Distance product line\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to cost-effectively attract new fliers, retainexistingfliers,andincreaseutilizationofourplatformbyexistingfliers.Historically,wehavemade,andexpectthatwewillneedtocontinuetomake,significantinvestmentsandimplementstrategicinitiativesinordertoattractnewfliers,suchasflieracquisitioncampaignsandthelaunchingofnewscheduledroutes.Theseinvestmentsandinitiativesmaynotbeeffectiveingeneratingsalesgrowthorprofits.Inaddition,marketingcampaignscanbeexpensiveandmaynotresultintheacquisitionofadditionalfliersinacost-effective manner, if at all. As our brand becomes more widely known, future marketing campaigns or brand content may not attract new fliers at the same rate as pastcampaignsorbrandcontent.Ifweareunabletoattractnewfliers,ourbusiness,financialcondition,andresultsofoperationswillbeadverselyaffected.\n\nOur fliers have a wide variety of options for transportation, including business aviation, commercial airlines, private aircraft operators, personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis,public transit, and ride-sharing offerings. To expand our flier base, we must appeal to new fliers who have historically used other forms of transportation. If fliers do notperceiveoururbanairmobilityservicestobereliable,safe,andcost-effective,orifwefailtooffernewandrelevantservicesandfeaturesonourplatform,wemaynotbeableto attract or retain fliers or increase their utilization of our platform. If we fail to continue to grow our flier base, retain existing fliers, or increase the overall utilization of ourplatform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nAbility to attract and retain customers in our MediMobility Organ Transport and Jet and Other product lines\n\nOur MediMobility Organ Transport product line primarily serves transplant centers, organ procurement organizations and hospitals (collectively, “Medical Customers”). Transportation for the hearts, lungs and livers that make up the vast majority of this product line is typically requested only hours before the required departure time. Our ability to successfully fulfill these requests with consistent pricing on the requested aircraft type, be it jet, turboprop or helicopter, is the primary metric by which Medical Customers evaluate our performance. \n\nThe organ transportation market is highly competitive and we compete for organ transportation business primarily on our ability to provide reliable, end-to-end air and ground transportation at competitive pricing. Increasingly, we compete directly with manufacturers of organ preservation equipment that also offer transportation or with providers that offer additional services, such as surgical organ recovery, that our customers find valuable. We may face increased competition as our Medical Customers may prefer a streamlined logistics offering, including services or technology that we cannot provide, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nWe utilize the same aircraft and aircraft operators in the Jet and Other product line of our Passenger segment. Historically, the combination of our Passenger and MediMobility Organ Transport demand, has been enough to incentivize operators to provide dedicated aircraft and crews for our use. However, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to secure dedicated aircraft at favorable rates, particularly given significant increases in demand for private jet aircraft in the United States in recent years. Periods of increased demand for private jets have historically led to increased charter costs and more limited availability in the spot jet charter market. Although this has not limited our ability to maintain or increase our access to dedicated jet aircraft at fixed prices in recent periods, jet charter, which makes up the majority of our Jet and Other product line, is highly competitive and volumes and pricing have historically been significantly influenced by overall market supply and demand.\n\nImpact of inflation to our business\n\nWe generally pay a fixed hourly rate to our third-party operators, based on flight hours flown. These rates are susceptible to inflation and are typically renegotiated on a yearly basis, though some multi-year contracts have fixed rate increases. Some contracts with operators allow for pass-through of fuel price increases above a set threshold. For our owned aircraft, we are more directly exposed to inflation of aircraft operating expenses, including pilot salaries, fuel, insurance, parts and maintenance.\n\nWe have historically passed through cost inflation to customers and most contracts with our MediMobility Organ Transport customers automatically pass through any fuel surcharges, but there is no guarantee this will continue in the future.\n\nPassenger Expansion into New Geographic Markets\n\nOur Passenger segment growth plan is focused on dense urban areas, primarily those with existing air transportation infrastructure that are facing increasing ground congestion. Growth in our Passenger segment will depend in part on our ability to successfully enter into new markets, create and introduce new routes, and expand our existing routes byadding more frequent flights. In these areas, our urban air mobility services can provide the most time savings for our fliers, and given the short distances involved, costs for our services can be comparable to luxury, private car services. Significant changes to our existing routes or the introduction of new and unproven routes may require us to obtain and maintain applicablepermits, authorizations, or other regulatory approvals. In addition, EVA may be commercially viable sooner in these markets given that battery technology constraints may limit the range of early models. Large urban markets with existing heliport infrastructure should be able to accommodate EVA while other cities may need several years to permit and build such infrastructure. \n\nIf these new or expanded routes are unsuccessful or fail to attract a sufficient number of fliers to be profitable, or we are unable to bring new or expanded routes to market efficiently, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, new third-party aircraft operator or flier demands regarding our services, including the availability of superior routes or a deterioration in the quality of our existing routes, could negatively affect the attractiveness of our platform and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to and additional investments in our routes or our business model. The number of potential fliers using our urban air mobility services in any market cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to operate in a profitable manner in any of our current or targeted future markets.\n\nDevelopment, approval and acceptance of EVA for commercial service\n\nWe intend to leverage the expected lower operating costs of EVA versus helicopters to reduce the price for our flights. Additionally, we expect the reduced noise footprint and zero carbon emission characteristics of EVA to allow for the development of new vertiports in our existing and new markets. However, EVA involves a complex set of technologies, which we rely on original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to develop and our third-party aircraft operators to adopt. However, before EVA can fly passengers or cargo, OEMs must receive requisite approvals from federal transportation authorities. No EVA aircraft are currently certified by the FAA for commercial operations in the United States, and there is no assurance that OEM research and development will result in government certified aircraft that are market-viable or commercially successful in a timely manner, or at all. In order to gain government certification, the performance, reliability, and safety of EVA must be proven, none of which can be assured. Even if EVA aircraft are certified, individual operators must conform EVA aircraft to their licenses, which requires FAA approval, and individual pilots also must be licensed and approved by the FAA to fly EVA aircraft, which could contribute to delays in any widespread use of EVA and potentially limit the number of EVA operators available to our business. There is no assurance that research and \n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\ndevelopment will result in government certified aircraft that are market-viable or commercially successful in a timely manner, or at all.\n\nWe believe that Blade is well positioned to introduce EVA into commercial service, once available, for a number of reasons. In our Passenger segment, we believe our existing Short Distance routes will be compatible with EVA, which are initially expected to have a limited range, and our existing terminal space will accommodate EVA. Additionally, we believe that the last-mile transports we perform using helicopters or ground vehicles in our Medical segment may be compatible with EVA, reducing organ transport time and cost for our customers. Blade’s unit economics are designed to be profitable using either conventional helicopters or EVA, even if early EVA do not deliver significant cost savings relative to helicopters. Moreover, Blade’s asset-light business model and technology platform are operator and aircraft agnostic, enabling a seamless transition to EVA.\n\nSeasonality\n\nPassenger segment\n\nHistorically, we have experienced significant seasonality in our Short Distance product line with flight volume peaking during the quarters ended June 30 (Q2) and September 30 (Q3) of each fiscal year due to the busy summer travel season, with lower volume during the first and fourth quarter (Q1 and Q4). \n\nJet and Other revenue has historically been stronger in the first and fourth quarter (Q1 and Q4) given that our by-the-seat jet service between New York and South Florida has historically operated only between November and April. We discontinued this service in Q4 2023 and do not expect the seasonality in our Jet and Other revenue to be significant in 2024.\n\nMedical segment\n\nHistorically, seasonality in our MediMobility Organ Transport product line has not been significant, though our trip volumes are correlated with the overall supply of donor hearts, livers and lungs in the United States, which can be volatile due to a variety of factors.\n\nKey Components of the Company’s Results of Operations\n\nRevenue\n\nShort Distance products are typically purchased using the Blade App and paid for principally via credit card transactions, wire, check, customer credit, and gift cards, with payments principally collected by the Company in advance of the performance of related services. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed.\n\nJet products are typically purchased through our Flier Relations associates and our app and are paid for principally via checks, wires and credit card. Jet payments are typically collected at the time of booking before the performance of the related service. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed. \n\nMediMobility Organ Transport products are typically purchased through our medical logistics coordinators and are paid for principally via checks and wires. Payments are generally collected after the performance of the related service in accordance with the client's payment terms. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed. \n\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, ROU asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ ground transportation revenue using the Company's owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries. \n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nSoftware Development\n\nSoftware development expenses consist primarily of staff costs, stock-based compensation costs and capitalized software amortization costs.\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses principally include staff costs including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, impairment of intangible assets, directors and officers insurance costs, pilot training costs for owned aircraft, professional fees, credit card processing fees and establishment costs. Depreciation of revenue-generating assets such as aircraft and vehicles are included in Cost of revenue. \n\nSelling and Marketing \n\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising costs, staff costs including stock-based compensation, marketing expenses, sales commissions and promotion costs. The trend and timing of our brand marketing expenses will depend in part on the timing of our expansion into new markets and other marketing campaigns.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThe following table presents our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nRevenue| $| 74,877 | $| 71,442 | $| 194,336 | $| 177,702   \nOperating expenses  \nCost of revenue| 55,040 | 55,863 | 148,006 | 144,590   \nSoftware development| 800 | 1,076 | 2,441 | 3,639   \nGeneral and administrative| 20,412 | 19,265 | 62,757 | 53,932   \nSelling and marketing| 2,162 | 2,686 | 6,686 | 8,025   \nTotal operating expenses| 78,414 | 78,890 | 219,890 | 210,186   \nLoss from operations| (3,537)| (7,448)| (25,554)| (32,484)  \nOther non-operating income (expense)  \nInterest income| 1,764 | 2,147 | 5,624 | 6,178   \nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities| (299)| 5,719 | 2,266 | 3,823   \nRealized loss from sales of short-term investments| — | — | — | (95)  \nTotal other non-operating income| 1,465 | 7,866 | 7,890 | 9,906   \n(Loss) income before income taxes| (2,072)| 418 | (17,664)| (22,578)  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense| (118)| 129 | (150)| (443)  \nNet (loss) income| $| (1,954)| $| 289 | $| (17,514)| $| (22,135)  \n  \n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nRevenue\n\nDisaggregated revenue by product line was as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| % Change| 2024| 2023| % Change  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nProduct Line:  \nShort Distance| $| 32,352 | $| 30,388 | 6 | %| $| 63,070 | $| 59,997 | 5 | %  \nJet and Other| 6,463 | 7,607 | (15)| %| 20,837 | 23,092 | (10)| %  \nMediMobility Organ Transport| 36,062 | 33,447 | 8 | %| 110,429 | 94,613 | 17 | %  \nTotal Revenue| $| 74,877 | $| 71,442 | 5 | %| $| 194,336 | $| 177,702 | 9 | %  \n  \nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue increased by $3.4 million or 5%, from $71.4 million in 2023 to $74.9 million in 2024. \n\nShort Distance revenue increased by $2.0 million or 6%, from $30.4 million in 2023 to $32.4 million in 2024. Growth in Short Distance was primarily driven by growth in our Hamptons seasonal service for a $2.3 million increase, and increased volumes of Northeast helicopter charters for a $0.8 million increase. This was partially offset by the August 31, 2024 termination of our Canada routes for a $0.8 million decrease, and lower activity in Europe for a $0.4 million decrease. \n\nJet and Other revenue decreased by $1.1 million or (15)% from $7.6 million in 2023 to $6.5 million in 2024. The decline was driven by a decrease in jet charters of $1.4 million, partially offset by the introduction of the new seasonal Hamptons Streamliner Bus for a $0.3 million increase.\n\nMediMobility Organ Transport revenue increased by $2.6 million or 8% from $33.4 million in 2023 to $36.1 million in 2024. Growth in MediMobility Organ Transport was driven primarily by growth in ground revenue for $1.8 million and $0.4 million for TOPS (TOPS was launched at the end of 2023), the remainder was due to new clients.\n\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue increased by $16.6 million or 9%, from $177.7 million in 2023 to $194.3 million in 2024. \n\nShort Distance revenue increased by $3.1 million or 5% from $60.0 million in 2023 to $63.1 million in 2024. Growth in Short Distance was primarily driven by growth in our Hamptons seasonal service for a $2.2 million increase, growth in our New York airport transfer products, including annual pass activity, for a $1.0 million increase, and increased volumes of Northeast helicopter charters for a $1.0 million increase. This was partially offset by lower activity and the termination of our Canada routes for a $1.1 million decrease. \n\nJet and Other revenue decreased by $(2.3) million or (10)% from $23.1 million in 2023 to $20.8 million in 2024. $3.9 million decrease is attributable to the discontinuation of our seasonal by-the-seat jet service between New York and South Florida. This decrease was partially offset by a $0.9 million growth in jet charters, and higher brand partnership revenues and revenue from the introduction of the new seasonal Hamptons Streamliner Bus in the current year period.\n\nMediMobility Organ Transport revenue increased by $15.8 million or 17% from $94.6 million in 2023 to $110.4 million in 2024. The growth was driven primarily by: $6.6 million attributable to the addition of new hospital clients including of TOPS; higher revenue from existing clients of $13.5 million (higher volumes, higher revenue per trip and higher ground revenue). Those increases were partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease due to one temporary customer we supported only in the 2023 period. Excluding the impact of the temporary customer, revenue would have grown 22% versus the 2023 period. \n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nCost of Revenue\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| % Change| 2024| 2023| % Change  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nCost of revenue| $| 55,040 | $| 55,863 | (1)| %| $| 148,006 | $| 144,590 | 2 | %  \nPercentage of revenue| 74 | %| 78 | %| (4)| %| 76 | %| 81 | %| (5)| %  \n  \nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue decreased by $(0.8) million, or (1)% from $55.9 million during 2023 to $55.0 million in 2024, driven by lower effective cost of revenue per flight (explained in the following paragraph), only partially offset by the higher volumes. \n\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenues decreased by 4 percentage points from 78% in 2023 to 74% in 2024. This change is attributable primarily to mix-shift to dedicated aircraft which operate at enhanced economies of scale in the Medical segment, higher revenue per flight hour in the Medical segment and improved pricing along with improved load factor in our New York airport transfer and Hamptons by-the-seat products, as well as lower cost of revenue in Canada of $1.5 million impact (Canada operated at a loss in the prior year period with cost of revenue higher than revenue) due to our exit from the Canadian market on August 31, 2024.\n\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue increased by $3.4 million or 2%, from $144.6 million during 2023 to $148.0 million during 2024 driven by increased flight volume. \n\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenues decreased by 5 percentage points from 81% in 2023 to 76% in 2024, attributable primarily to: a mix-shift to dedicated aircraft in the Medical segment, which operate at enhanced economies of scale; increased revenue per flight hour in our Medical segment; improved pricing with improved load factor in our Hamptons by-the-seat product and in our New York airport transfer products, New York airport products moved to profit from a loss position in the prior year period; and improved pricing in jet charter flights compared to the prior year period.\n\nSoftware Development\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| % Change| 2024| 2023| % Change  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nSoftware development| $| 800 | 1,076 | (26)| %| $| 2,441 | 3,639 | (33)| %  \nPercentage of revenue| 1 | %| 2 | %| 1 | %| 2 | %  \n  \nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, software development costs decreased by $(0.3) million, or (26)%, from $1.1 million during 2023 to $0.8 million in 2024, primarily due to software capitalization of development costs due to more development initiatives in the 2024 period. \n\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, software development costs decreased by $(1.2) million, or (33)%, from $3.6 million during 2023 to $2.4 million during 2024, primarily due to software capitalization of development costs due to more development initiatives in the 2024 period for a $0.8 million impact, and a decrease of $0.4 million in stock-based compensation costs. \n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| % Change| 2024| 2023| % Change  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nGeneral and administrative| $| 20,412 | $| 19,265 | 6 | %| $| 62,757 | $| 53,932 | 16 | %  \nPercentage of revenue| 27 | %| 27 | %| 32 | %| 30 | %  \n  \nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expense increased by $1.1 million, or 6%, from $19.3 million during 2023 to $20.4 million in 2024. \n\nThe primary drivers for the increase were a $2.1 million increase in stock-based compensation largely due to the PSUs granted in the first quarter of the current year period; a $0.8 million increase in expenses related to the owned aircraft (acquired in the second quarter of 2024 and did not exist in the prior year period) as pilot training, hangar costs and insurance; a $0.7 million increase in staff costs mostly attributable to the growth in our Medical segment; a $0.5 million charge for restructuring costs in Europe; and a $0.5 million increase in professional fees.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as segment Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of segment revenue.(4) Percentage not meaningful.  \n  \nPassenger segment\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Passenger revenue increased by $0.8 million or 2%, from $38.0 million in 2023 to $38.8 million in 2024. The increase was attributable to a $2.0 million increase in Short Distance offset by a $1.1 million decrease in Jet and Other. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under “—Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023—Revenue” for more details. \n\nPassenger Adjusted EBITDA improved by $2.8 million or 101% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $2.8 million in the same period of 2023 to $5.6 million in 2024.The improvement is primarily attributable: to a $2.2 million impact from lower effective cost of revenue per flight in our New York airport transfer and Hamptons products (attributable to improved pricing and load factor in the by-the-seat products) and in Europe; and a $0.7 million improvement in Canada, which moved from a negative to a positive revenue less cost of revenue in the current year period compared to the prior year period (attributable to improved load factor and our exit from the Canadian market on August 31, 2024).\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Passenger revenue increased by $0.8 million or 1% from $83.1 millionin 2023 to $83.9 million in 2024. The increase was attributable to a $3.1 million increase in Short Distance that was partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in Jet and Other. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under “—Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023—Revenue” for more details. \n\nPassenger Adjusted EBITDA improved by $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $(2.4) million in the same period of 2023 to $3.7 million in 2024.The improvement is primarily attributable to higher revenue combined with lower effective cost of revenue per flight across all of Passenger flights (short distance and jet flights) compared to the prior year period for a $4.9 million impact, attributable to improved pricing and improved load factor. Further improvements are attributable to a \n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\n$1.1 million decrease in marketing expenses and a $0.4 million decrease in personnel costs. These improvements were partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in staff costs. \n\nMedical segment\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Medical revenue increased by $2.6 million or 8%, from $33.4 million in 2023 to $36.1 million in 2024.  Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under “—Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023—Revenue” for more details. \n\nMedical Adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.5 million or 15%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $3.3 million in the same period of 2023 to $3.9 million in 2024. Due to: $1.3 million increase in revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation) due to higher volumes combined with lower effective cost of revenue per flight (due to higher revenue per flight hour and mix-shift towards dedicated aircraft operating at enhanced economies of scale). This increase was partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in fixed costs, primarily due to an increase in staff costs in order to support the higher activity and the new TOPS offering. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Medical revenue increased by $15.8 million or 17%, from $94.6 million in 2023 to $110.4 million in 2024. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under “—Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023—Revenue” for more details. \n\nMedical Adjusted EBITDA increased by $5.5 million or 67%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $8.2 million in the same period of 2023 to $13.8 million in 2024. $8.3 million of the increase is attributable to higher revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation) due to: larger volumes combined with lower effective cost of revenue, attributable to: higher revenue per flight hour, mix-shift to dedicated aircraft and mix shift to ground revenue (which is characterized with lower effective cost of revenue). This was partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in fixed costs, primarily staff costs in order to support the higher activity, adding ground hubs and the new TOPS offering that did not exist in the prior year period. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Flight Profit and Flight Margin\n\nThe following table presents our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Flight Profit and Flight Margin results:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| % Change| 2024| 2023| % Change  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1)| $| 4,180 | $| 787 | 431 | %| $| 1,592 | $| (11,385)| NM(2)  \nFlight Profit(1)| $| 19,837 | $| 15,579 | 27 | %| $| 46,330 | $| 33,112 | 40 | %  \nFlight Margin(1)| 26.5 | %| 21.8 | %| 23.8 | %| 18.6 | %  \n  \n(1) See section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\n(2) Percentage not meaningful.\n\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nAdjusted EBITDAimproved by $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.8 millionin the same period of 2023 to $4.2 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable to improvements in both Passenger and Medical Adjusted EBITDA (refer to the discussion above), coupled with a $0.1 million decrease in Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses and software development staff costs.\n\nFlight Profit increased by $4.3 million or 27% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $15.6 millionin the same period of 2023 to $19.8 million in 2024. The increase was driven by a 5% increase in revenue coupled with lower effective cost of revenue per flight for both Passenger and Medical flights. In Passenger the lower effective cost of revenue per flight is attributable to improved pricing along with improved load factor in our US Short Distance flights, and a $0.7 million improvement in Canada (which operated at a negative Flight Profit in the prior year period). The lower effective cost of revenue per flight in Medical flights is attributable to higher revenue per flight hour and mix-shift to dedicated aircraft operating at enhanced economies of scale.\n\n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nFlight Margin increased from 21.8% in the three months ended September 30,2024 to 26.5% in the same period of 2023, attributable to lower effective cost of revenue per flight in both Passenger and Medical flights as described above under Flight Profit.\n\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nAdjusted EBITDAimproved by $13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $(11.4) millionin the same period of 2023 to $1.6 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable to Adjusted EBITDA improvements of $6.1 million and $5.5 million in Passenger and Medical, respectively (refer to the discussion above), coupled with a $1.4 million decrease in Adjusted unallocated corporate costs and software development, attributable to a $1.0 million decrease in staff costs and a $0.5 million decrease in professional services and insurance.\n\nFlight Profit increased by $13.2 million or 40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $33.1 millionin the same period of 2023 to $46.3 million in 2024. The increase was driven by a 9% increase in revenue coupled with lower effective cost of revenue per flight across all of Passenger product lines (Short Distance and jet flights) compared to the prior year period attributable to improved pricing and improved load factor (in the by-the-seat products). In addition lower effective cost of revenue in Medical due to higher revenue per flight hour, mix-shift to dedicated aircraft and mix shift to ground revenue (which is characterized with lower effective cost of revenue).\n\nFlight Margin increased from 18.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023to 23.8% in the same period of 2024, attributable to lower effective cost of revenue per flight in both Passenger and Medical flights as described above under Flight Profit.\n\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nCertain non-GAAP measures included in this segment results of operations review have been derived from amounts calculated in accordance with GAAP but are not themselves GAAP measures. Blade believes that the non-GAAP measure discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. GAAP results, provide useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These include Adjusted EBITDA, Flight Profit and Flight Margin, which we define, explain the use of and reconcile to the nearest GAAP financial measure below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, (4) interest income and expense, (5) income tax, (6) realized gains and losses on short-term investments, (7) impairment of intangible assets and (8) certain other non-recurring items (shown below) that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods. \n\n40\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nNet (loss) income| $| (1,954)| $| 289| $| (17,514)| $| (22,135)  \nAdd (deduct):  \nDepreciation and amortization| 1,279 | 1,843 | 4,432 | 5,305   \nStock-based compensation| 5,345 | 3,330 | 15,434 | 9,348   \nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities| 299 | (5,719)| (2,266)| (3,823)  \nRealized loss from sales of short-term investments| — | — | — | 95   \nInterest income| (1,764)| (2,147)| (5,624)| (6,178)  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense| (118)| 129 | (150)| (443)  \nLegal and regulatory advocacy fees (1)(2)| 165 | 217 | 427 | 640   \nExecutive severance costs| 140 | — | 140 | 265   \nSOX readiness costs| 220 | 145 | 302 | 180   \nContingent consideration compensation (earn-out) (3)| — | 2,700 | — | 5,361   \nM&A transaction costs| 85 | — | 169 | —   \nImpairment of intangible assets | — | — | 5,759 | —   \nRestructuring costs - Blade Europe (4)| 483 | — | 483 | —   \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 4,180| $| 787| $| 1,592| $| (11,385)  \nRevenue| $| 74,877 | $| 71,442 | $| 194,336 | $| 177,702   \nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue| 6 | %| 1 | %| 1 | %| (6)| %  \n  \n(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents legal advocacy fees related to the Drulias lawsuit (see “— Legal and Environmental” within Note 11) that we do not consider representative of legal and regulatory advocacy costs that we will incur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. \n\n(2) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents certain legal and regulatory advocacy fees for certain proposed restrictions at East Hampton Airport and the potential operational restrictions on large jet aircraft at Westchester Airport, that we do not consider representative of legal and regulatory advocacy costs that we will incur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.

Flight Margin is calculated as Flight Profit divided by revenue. Flight Profit and Flight Margin are measures that management uses to assess the performance of the business. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide a useful measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they focus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with generating revenue such as third party variable costs and costs of owning and operating Blade’s owned aircraft. \n\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nGross Profit, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Flight Profit, is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and other costs directly related to revenue generating transactions, including credit card processing fees, depreciation and amortization, direct staff costs including stock-based compensation, commercial costs and establishment costs. Gross Margin is calculated as Gross Profit divided by revenue. The reconciliation of Gross Profit to Flight Profit can be found in the table below.\n\n41\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nRevenue | $| 74,877 | $| 71,442 | $| 194,336 | $| 177,702   \nLess:  \nCost of revenue (1)| 55,040 | 55,863 | 148,006 | 144,590   \nDepreciation and amortization (2)| 558 | 1,627 | 2,769 | 4,742   \nStock-based compensation| 36 | 44 | 149 | 124   \nOther (3)| 4,805 | 3,865 | 11,786 | 9,893   \nGross Profit | $| 14,438 | $| 10,043 | $| 31,626 | $| 18,353   \nGross Margin| 19.3 | %| 14.1 | %| 16.3 | %| 10.3 | %  \nGross Profit | $| 14,438 | $| 10,043 | $| 31,626 | $| 18,353   \nReconciling items:  \nDepreciation and amortization (2)| 558 | 1,627 | 2,769 | 4,742   \nStock-based compensation| 36 | 44 | 149 | 124   \nOther (3)| 4,805 | 3,865 | 11,786 | 9,893   \nFlight Profit| $| 19,837 | $| 15,579 | $| 46,330 | $| 33,112   \nFlight Margin| 26.5 | %| 21.8 | %| 23.8 | %| 18.6 | %  \n  \n(1) Cost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, ROU asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ ground transportation revenue using the Company's owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries.\n\n(2) Depreciation and amortization included within general and administrative expenses. \n\n(3) Other costs include credit card processing fees, direct staff costs, commercial costs and establishment costs.\n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nSources of Liquidity\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total liquidity of $136.3 million and $166.1 million, respectively, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $20.0 million and $27.9 million, respectively, and short-term investments of $116.3 million and $138.3 million, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had restricted cash of $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, $116.3 million of short-term investments consisted of securities that are traded in highly liquid markets.\n\nWith $136.3 million of total liquid funds as of September 30, 2024, we anticipate that we have sufficient funds to meet our current operational needs for at least the next 12 months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report. \n\nLiquidity Requirements\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had net working capital of $144.6 million, zero debt, cash and cash equivalents of $20.0 million and short-term investments of $116.3 million. The Company had net losses of $17.5 million and $22.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nIn the course of our business, we have certain contractual relationships with third-party aircraft operators pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had commitments to purchase flights from various aircraft operators with aggregate minimum flight purchase guarantees of $2.4 million and $15.4 million for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively, $0.2 million and $8.7 million, respectively, of which may be cancelled by us immediately if a government authority enacts travel restrictions and $— million and $2.8 million, respectively, of which could be terminated by Blade for convenience upon 60 days’ notice with the annual minimum guarantee being pro-rated as of the termination date. See “—Capacity Purchase Agreements” (“CPAs”) within Note 11 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information and for information about future periods. Additionally, the Company has operating lease obligations related to real estate and vehicles with expected annual minimum lease payments of $0.4 million and $2.0 million for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. See Note 5 “Right-of-Use Asset and Operating Lease Liability” to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information and for information about future periods.\n\nWe have non-cancellable commitments which primarily relate to cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. The amounts are determined based on the non-cancellable quantities to which we are contractually obligated. In December 2023, the Company entered into a technology service agreement with a vendor for cloud computing services where we are committed to spend $0.1 million and $1.1 million for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. \n\nOn March 20, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company may repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $20.0 million of the Company's common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased $0.2 million of common stock pursuant to this program ending with a remaining potential repurchase capacity under the program of approximately $19.8 million. No shares were repurchased in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash. Our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash.\n\nWe expect to incur net losses in the short term, as we continue to execute our strategic initiatives. Based on our current liquidity, we believe that no additional capital will be needed to execute our current business plan over the next 12 months. Our longer term liquidity requirement will depend on many factors including the pace of our expansion into new markets, our ability to attract and retain customers for our existing products, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nCash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nNet cash used in operating activities| $| (767)| $| (23,029)  \nNet cash (used in) / provided by investing activities| (4,992)| 17,014   \nNet cash used in financing activities| (1,885)| (53)  \nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash balances| 29 | (81)  \nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash| (7,615)| (6,149)  \n  \nCash Used In Operating Activities\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $0.8 million, driven by a net loss of $17.5 million and $3.2 million of cash used for working capital requirements, adjusted for non-cash items consisting of stock-based compensation expense of $15.4 million, impairment of intangible assets of $5.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $4.4 million, non-cash accretion of interest income on held-to-maturity securities of $3.1 million and income from change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $2.3 million. The $3.2 million of cash used for working capital requirements was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.3 million, driven by the cash payment for the Trinity contingent consideration compensation and for the 2023 short term incentive plan paid in March of 2024, an increase in accounts receivable of $3.6 million (attributable to the revenue growth in the Medical segment) and a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.2 million (driven by Passenger client prepayments and gift cards); partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8.3 million (driven by the utilization of $9.3 million of prepaid deposits under CPAs with M&N as part of the purchase of the seven aircraft, slightly offset by new prepayments made to operators in connection with new CPAs) and a decrease in other non-current assets of $0.5 million (a lease deposit refund).\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $23.0 million, primarily driven by a net loss of $22.1 million and $6.8 million cash used for working capital requirements, adjusted for non-cash items consisting of stock-based compensation expense of $9.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $5.3 million, non-cash accretion of interest income on held-to-maturity securities of $4.7 million, income from change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $3.8 million, realized loss of $0.1 million from the sale of short-term investments, and a deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million. The $6.8 million cash used for working capital requirements was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of $10.4 million, due to the rapid growth in the Medical segment, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.1 million, driven by prepayments to operators in connection with capacity purchase agreements; partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.1 million, and an increase in lease liabilities of $0.4 million.\n\nCash (Used In) / Provided by Investing Activities\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $5.0 million, driven by $168.0 million of proceeds from maturities of held-to-maturity investments offset by $142.8 million in purchases of held-to-maturity investments; $26.3 million in purchases of property and equipment, consisting primarily of $22.8 million in the acquisition of ten aircraft and related capitalized costs to support the Medical segment, with the remaining in furniture and fixtures for new office space in Arizona used by the Medical segment, and purchase of vehicles used in generating revenue by the Medical segment; $2.2 million in consideration paid for the acquisition of CJK and $1.7 million in capitalized software development costs.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was $17.0 million, driven by $20.5 million of proceeds from sales of other short-term investments; $264.5 million of proceeds from maturities of held-to-maturity investments, partially offset by $265.8 million in purchases of held-to-maturity investments; $0.1 million in purchases of other short-term investments; and $2.1 million in purchases of property and equipment, consisting of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for lounges used by the Passenger segment, and vehicles used in generating revenue by the Medical segment.\n\n44\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nCash Used In Financing Activities\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 million, reflecting $1.8 million cash paid for payroll tax payments on behalf of employees in exchange for shares withheld by the Company (“net share settlement”) and $0.2 million in repurchases and retirement of common stock under the share repurchase program announced March 20, 2024; partially offset by $0.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $0.05 million, primarily reflecting $0.1 million cash paid for payroll tax payments made on behalf of employees in exchange for shares withheld by the Company (“net share settlement”), partially offset by $0.06 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\n\nThis discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nFor information on the Company’s significant accounting policies and estimates refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to these policies and estimates as of September 30, 2024.\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\n\nThere have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures \n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nWe determined that our internal control over financial reporting had the following material weaknesses:\n\n•A lack of effective IT General Controls in relation to:\n\n◦user access controls that adequately restrict user access to financial applications, programs and data affecting underlying accounting records, and\n\n◦the change management controls for certain operational applications that ensure IT program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized and implemented properly.\n\n•A number of control deficiencies in relation to the revenue process that, although not individually material in nature, in aggregate constitute a material weakness.\n\nManagement has concluded that these deficiencies may impact the Company’s financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and represent a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \n\n45\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nBecause disclosure controls and procedures include those components of internal control over financial reporting that provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management also determined that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the above-mentioned material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.\n\nNotwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with GAAP.\n\nManagement’s Plans for Remediation\n\nWe have identified and implemented, and continue to implement, certain remediation efforts to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These remediation efforts are ongoing and include the following measures to address the material weaknesses identified:\n\n•We have completed controls testing to enable management to assess the operating effectiveness of the change management controls for the Company’s main operational IT application and we are in the process of implementing those same change management controls for our other operational IT applications. \n\n•We are re-enforcing procedures on proper user access administration and the need for timely documentation of associated requests and approvals.\n\n•We have designed additional controls to supplement the existing business process controls in relation to revenues, with these controls implemented in Q3 2024.\n\nWe expect the above actions will be completed before the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. As we continue to evaluate and improve the applicable controls, management may take additional remedial measures or modify the remediation plan described above.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOther than the specific remediation steps discussed above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting in the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024. \n\nLimitations on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nAn internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\n\n46\n\n[Table of Contents](#ic2ed2f98a27f445690016e3b493693cd_13)\n\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1.

Risk Factors\n\nYou should carefully consider the risks described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nItem 2.

(“Blade” or the “Company”) provides air transportation and logistics for hospitals across the\nUnited States, where it is one of the largest transporters of human organs for transplant, and for passengers, with helicopter\nand fixed wing services primarily in the Northeast United States and Southern Europe. Based in New York City, Blade's\nasset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to\nfacilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft (“EVA” or “eVTOL”),\nenabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and Article\n10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for\ncomplete financial statements. Management’s opinion is that all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments)\nconsidered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows at the dates and for\nthe periods presented have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. These financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nShort-Term Investments\nHeld-to-Maturity Securities\nThe Company's investments in held-to-maturity securities consist of investment grade U.S. Treasury obligations with\nmaturity dates of less than 365 days. The Company has the ability and intention to hold these securities until maturity.\nAccordingly, these securities are recorded in the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet at\namortized cost and interest is recorded within interest income on the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations. The held-to-maturity securities balance and fair market value at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 were $116,310 and $116,509, and $138,264 and $138,285, respectively. The fair value hierarchy of the\nvaluation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair market value is Level 2. See Note 13 – Fair Value\nMeasurements for additional information.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company incurs costs related to the development of its technology stack. The costs consist of personnel costs\n(including related benefits and stock-based compensation) and external vendor costs incurred during the development\nstage. Capitalization of costs begins when two criteria are met: (1) the preliminary project stage is completed, and (2) it is\nprobable that the software will be completed and used for its intended function. Capitalization ceases when the project is\nsubstantially complete and the developed features are ready for their intended use, including the completion of all\nsignificant testing. Costs related to preliminary project activities, post implementation operating activities and system\nmaintenance are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized costs are included in intangible assets and amortized over three years, on a straight-line basis, which represents\nthe manner in which the expected benefit will be derived. The amortization of capitalized software development costs are\nrecorded within software development expense in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nConcentrations\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consists principally of cash\namounts on deposit with financial institutions. At times, the Company’s cash in banks is in excess of the Federal Deposit\nInsurance corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits.\n9\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nMajor Customers\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenue for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable as of September 30,\n2024 or as of December 31, 2023.\nMajor Vendors\nOne vendor accounted for 12% of the Company’s purchases from operating vendors for the three months ended September\n30, 2024. Two vendors accounted for 14% and 12%, respectively, of the Company’s purchases from operating vendors for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023.\nOne vendor accounted for 11% of the Company’s purchases from operating vendors for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. Two vendors accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s purchases from operating\nvendors for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOne vendor accounted for 12% of the Company’s outstanding accounts payable as of September 30, 2024. Two vendors\naccounted for 17% and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding accounts payable as of December 31, 2023.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed utilizing the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Residual values estimated for aircraft are approximately\n10% of the original purchase price. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized,\nand maintenance and repair are expensed as incurred (see below for further information). Leasehold improvements\ndepreciation is computed over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.\nDuring the period from April 1, 2024 through May 2, 2024, Blade completed the acquisition of seven aircraft (“Acquired\nAircraft”) from M&N Equipment, LLC (“M&N”), Atlas Jet, Inc and Aviation Bridge, LLC for a combined purchase price\nof approximately $17,621. The funding for these acquisitions involved the utilization of $9,269 from existing prepaid\ndeposits under existing Capacity Purchase Agreements (“CPAs”) with M&N which were refunded to Blade and applied to\nthe purchase, $5,489 in cash and the remaining amount payable was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses,\nwhich were subject to traditional closing conditions, inspections, holdbacks and adjustments. Blade intends to utilize the\nAcquired Aircraft, which were previously dedicated to Blade under existing CPAs (see Note 5 for further information on\nCPAs) to support its Medical segment and the Acquired Aircraft will continue to be operated by the same operator.\nIn August and September 2024, Blade purchased three additional aircraft for a combined purchase price of $7,388. All of\nthe aircraft acquired by Blade are dedicated to Blade's Medical segment.\nUseful Life September 30, December 31,\n(in years) 2024 2023\nAircraft, engines and related rotable parts (1) 2 - 20 $ 25,944 $ —\nFurniture and fixtures (2) 5 2,222 886\nTechnology equipment (2) 3 569 402\nLeasehold improvements (2) Shorter of useful life or life of lease 3,539 3,016\nVehicles (1) 5 2,673 1,750\nTotal property and equipment, gross 34,947 6,054\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (4,397) (3,155)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 30,550 $ 2,899\n(1) Depreciation expense is included within cost of revenue.\n(2) Depreciation expense is included within general and administrative expenses.\n10\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded depreciation expense for property and\nequipment of $815 and $302, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company\nrecorded depreciation expense for property and equipment of $2,003 and $802, respectively.\nAircraft Maintenance and Repairs\nUnscheduled aircraft maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, scheduled maintenance and repairs occurring at\nintervals of two or more years are capitalized and amortized over the period between these intervals.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company assesses long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”). Long-lived assets, except for goodwill and\nindefinite-lived intangible assets, consist of property and equipment and finite-lived acquired intangible assets, such as\nexclusive rights to air transportation services, customer lists and trademarks. Long-lived assets, except for goodwill and\nindefinite intangible assets, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances arise, the\nCompany compares the carrying amount of the long-lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected\nto be generated by the long-lived assets. If the estimated aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying\namount of the long-lived assets, an impairment charge, calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets\nexceeds the fair value of the assets, is recorded. The fair value of the long-lived assets is determined through various\nvaluation techniques, including estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset and\npricing information on comparable market transactions, unless another method provides a more reliable estimate. If an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of a long-lived asset is recognized as a new cost basis of the\nimpaired asset. Impairment loss is not reversed even if fair value exceeds carrying amount in subsequent periods.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5,759 related to the exclusive\nrights to air transportation services associated with Blade Canada. The charge brought the net book value of the exclusive\nrights to zero. This amount is included within general and administrative expenses in the unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and is part of the Passenger segment. The impairment resulted from a modification to\nthe November 30, 2021 agreement with Helijet, effective June 1, 2024, which included an earlier termination date of\nAugust 31, 2025 (previously an initial term of five years with automatic renewals for successive two-year periods). During\nthe third quarter ended September 30, 2024, the termination date was furthered modified to be August 31, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the remaining exclusive rights to air transportation services intangible asset balance is $3,745,\nwhich relates to the air transportation rights associated with the acquisition of Blade Europe. This amount is included in the\nIntangibles assets, net line item on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from\nvarious reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nThese exemptions include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public\naccounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of\nholding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute\npayments not previously approved.\n11\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new\nor revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act\nregistration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required\nto comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt\nout of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but\nany such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected to use such extended transition period which means\nthat when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the\nCompany, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the\nnew or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s consolidated financial statements with another\npublic company that is not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the\nextended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its\nestimates on historical experience, current business factors, and various other assumptions that the Company believes are\nnecessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the recorded\namounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company is subject to\nuncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in the Company’s business\nenvironment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the\npreparation of the Company’s financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as\nadditional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment evolves.\nChanges in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation\nmethodologies are reflected in reported results of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in\nthe notes to the financial statements. Significant estimates and assumptions by management include, but are not limited to,\nthe fair value of intangible assets and goodwill, the determination of whether a contract contains a lease, the allocation of\nconsideration between lease and non-lease components, the determination of incremental borrowing rates for leases and the\nprovision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Adopted\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements. The new guidance clarifies or improves\ndisclosure and presentation requirements on a variety of topics in the codification. The amendments in the update are\nintended to align the requirements in the FASB ASC with the SEC’s regulations. The amendments are effective\nprospectively on the date each individual amendment is effectively removed from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, or if\nthe SEC has not removed the requirements by June 30, 2027, this amendment will be removed from the Codification and\nwill not become effective for any entity. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU\nwill have on the financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures, which expands the segment disclosures of public entities. This expansion includes the requirement to disclose\nsignificant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and are included within each\nreported measure of segment profit or loss. Additionally, the ASU mandates the disclosure of the amount and description\nof the composition of other segment items, as well as interim disclosures of a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets.\nThese disclosure requirements apply to public entities with a single reportable segment as well. The ASU will be effective\nfor the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and early adoption is\nallowed. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU\nrequires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional\ninformation on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a\nprospective basis. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made\n12\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\navailable for issuance.

This ASU amends the Codification to remove references to various concepts statements and impacts a\nvariety of topics in the Codification. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected\naccounting guidance. Generally, the amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended to result in significant accounting\nchanges for most entities. ASU 2024-02 is effective January 1, 2025. The Company is in the process of evaluating the\nimpact the adoption of this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the SEC\nhave not had, or are not anticipated to have, a significant effect on the Company''s unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, both present and future.\nNote 2 – Revenue\nRevenue Recognition\nBlade operates in three key product lines across two segments (see Note 7 for further information on reportable segments):\nPassenger segment\n• Short Distance – Consisting primarily of helicopter and amphibious seaplane flights in the United States and Europe\nbetween 10 and 100 miles in distance. Flights are available for purchase both by-the-seat and on a full aircraft charter\nbasis. Short Distance products are typically purchased using the Blade App and paid for principally via credit card\ntransactions, wire, check, customer credit, and gift cards, with payments principally collected by the Company in\nadvance of the performance of related services, with the exception of Europe where institutional clients pay after the\nperformance of related services under payment terms. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed.\n• Jet and Other – Consists principally of revenues from non-medical jet charter and by-the-seat jet flights between New\nYork and South Florida (discontinued in November 2023), revenue from brand partners for exposure to Blade fliers\nand certain ground transportation services. Jet products are typically purchased through our Flier Relations associates\nand our app and are paid for principally via checks, wires and credit card. Jet payments are typically collected at the\ntime of booking before the performance of the related service. The revenue is recognized when the service is\ncompleted.\nMedical segment\n• MediMobility Organ Transport – Consisting primarily of transportation of human organs for transplant and/or the\nmedical teams supporting these services. Blade also offers additional services including donor logistics coordination\nand support evaluating potential donor organs. MediMobility Organ Transport products are typically purchased\nthrough our medical logistics coordinators and are paid for principally via checks and wires. Payments are generally\ncollected after the performance of the related service in accordance with the client's payment terms. The revenue is\nrecognized when the service is completed.\nThe Company initially records advance payments for passenger flights in deferred revenue, deferring revenue recognition\nuntil the travel occurs. Deferred revenue from advance payments, customer credit and gift card purchases is recognized as\nrevenue when a flight is flown. Deferred revenue from the Company’s passes is recognized ratably over the term of the\npass. For travel that has more than one flight segment, the Company deems each segment as a separate performance\nobligation and recognizes revenue for each segment as travel occurs. Fees charged in association with add-on services,\nchanges or extensions to non-refundable seats sold are considered part of the Company's passenger performance obligation.\nAs such, those fees are deferred at the time of collection and recognized at the time the travel is provided.\n13\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nDisaggregated Revenue\nDisaggregated revenue by product line and segment was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPassenger Segment\nShort Distance $ 32,352 $ 30,388 $ 63,070 $ 59,997\nJet and Other 6,463 7,607 20,837 23,092\nTotal $ 38,815 $ 37,995 $ 83,907 $ 83,089\nMedical Segment\nMediMobility Organ Transport $ 36,062 $ 33,447 $ 110,429 $ 94,613\nTotal $ 36,062 $ 33,447 $ 110,429 $ 94,613\nTotal Revenue $ 74,877 $ 71,442 $ 194,336 $ 177,702\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities are defined as entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has\nreceived consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany's contract liability balance is $6,681 and $6,845 respectively, and is recorded as deferred revenue on its\nunaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. This balance consists of payments from customers received in\nadvance of the actual flight, prepaid monthly and annual flight passes, customer credits for flight reservations that were\ncancelled for good reason by the customer, and prepaid gift card obligations. The customer has one year to use the credit as\npayment for a future flight with the Company. The table below presents a roll forward of the contract liability balance:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ 6,845 $ 6,709\nAdditions 61,177 58,492\nRevenue recognized (61,341) (58,366)\nBalance, end of period $ 6,681 $ 6,835\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $4,470 of revenue that was included in the\ncontract liability balance as of January 1, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized\n$5,213 of revenue that was included in the contract liability balance as of January 1, 2023.\nCertain governmental taxes are imposed on the Company's flight sales through a fee included in flight prices. The\nCompany collects these fees and remits them to the appropriate government agency. These fees are excluded from revenue.\nThe Company’s quarterly financial data is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, its second and third quarter (ended\non June 30 and September 30, respectively) financial results have reflected higher Passenger travel demand and were better\nthan the first and fourth quarter financial results.\n14\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nNote 3 – Acquisitions\nAcquisition of CJK Enterprise, Inc.\nOn September 26, 2024, Blade Air Mobility, Inc. through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Trinity Air Medical, LLC\n(“Trinity”), completed an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) to acquire certain assets and liabilities of CJK Enterprise,\nInc. (“CJK”) for a total purchase price of $2,230 in cash. CJK specializes in providing physicians and organs ground\ntransportation services in the New York Tri-State area. This acquisition further expands Blade’s MediMobility presence in\nthis key market. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nconstituted a business in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Acquisition-related costs\ntotaling $37 were expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the unaudited interim\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The results of CJK from\nSeptember 26, 2024 (“acquisition date”) to September 30, 2024 were not significant, and have been included in the\nMedical segment.\nNet Assets Acquired\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements as of the acquisition date on a preliminary basis and changes to these allocations may occur as additional\ninformation becomes available during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). At acquisition,\nthe Company recognized goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the identifiable assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed, totaling $2,212. The primary components of goodwill include operational synergies,\nservice expansion in the New York Tri-State area, and the value attributed to key personnel relationships contributing to\ncustomer retention. The acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nThe purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis as follows:\nProperty and equipment, net 18\nOperating right-of-use asset 137\nTotal identifiable assets acquired 155\nOperating lease liability 137\nTotal liabilities assumed 137\nNet assets acquired 18\nGoodwill 2,212\nTotal consideration $ 2,230\nThe pro forma impact of the acquisition was not material to our historical unaudited interim condensed consolidated\noperating results and is therefore not presented.\nNote 4 – Goodwill\nThe changes in the carrying value of goodwill are as follows:\nGoodwill balance, December 31, 2023 $ 40,373\nAdditions (1) 2,212\nForeign currency translation 367\nGoodwill balance, September 30, 2024 $ 42,952\n(1) Additions represent goodwill associated with the acquisition of CJK. See Note 3 for additional information.\nNote 5 – Operating Right-of-Use Asset and Operating Lease Liability\nBlade’s operating leases consist of airport and heliport terminals, offices, vehicles and aircraft leases that are embedded\nwithin certain CPAs. Upon meeting certain criteria as stated in ASC 842 Leases (“ASC 842”), the lease component of a\nCPA would be accounted for as an embedded lease, with a corresponding balance included in the operating right-of-use\n(“ROU”) asset and lease liability.\n15\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had the following lease transactions in accordance with\nASC 842:\nEffective in July 2024, Blade entered into two agreements with separate operators for up to a 15-month term ending\nOctober 2025 for two aircraft. Under these CPAs, if the agreement expires or is terminated for cause, the flight hour\nguarantee will be pro-rated to the date of the termination. Additionally, Blade has the right for immediate termination with\nno penalty if a government authority enacts travel restrictions.\nAn existing CPA for eight aircraft utilized by our Medical segment, was restated and amended in January 2024 for a four-\nyear term ending November 30, 2027. Subsequently, this agreement was terminated in April 2024 for seven aircraft after\nBlade’s acquisition of those seven aircraft (see “—Property and Equipment, Net” within Note 1). The CPA for the eighth\naircraft was terminated in July 2024.\nAn existing three aircraft CPA agreement was expanded on May 1, 2024 when a fourth aircraft commenced operations.\nThe four aircraft are rotorcraft utilized by both our Passenger and Medical segment. In case of early termination by Blade, a\none-year purchase guarantee will be pro-rated to the date of the termination. In addition, Blade has the right for immediate\ntermination with no penalty if a government authority enacts travel restrictions.\nAdditionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset and a lease\nliability for new office spaces.

In addition, per ASC 280, Segment Reporting, paragraph\n280-10-50-11, two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single reportable segment if the segments have\nsimilar economic characteristics. The Company has identified two reportable segments - Passenger and Medical, as our\nChief Executive Officer, who is our CODM, regularly reviews discrete information for those two reportable segments. The\nPassenger segment consists of our two product lines Short Distance and Jet and Other. The Medical segment consists of the\nMediMobility Organ Transport product line. Our product lines are defined in Note 2 — Revenue.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, the Company changed its primary measure of segment performance to Adjusted\nEBITDA, as the CODM evaluates the performance of the segments and allocates resources primarily based on their\nrespective Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the operational efficiency and core results of our segment,\nindependent of tax implications and non-operational financial factors. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to\nexclude (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, (4)\ninterest income and expense, (5) income tax, (6) realized gains and losses on short-term investments, (7) impairment of\nintangible assets and (8) certain other non-recurring items (shown below) that management does not believe are indicative\nof ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n19\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nThe following tables reflect certain financial data of the Company’s reportable segments:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSegment revenue\nPassenger $ 38,815 $ 37,995 $ 83,907 $ 83,089\nMedical 36,062 33,447 110,429 94,613\nTotal revenue $ 74,877 $ 71,442 $ 194,336 $ 177,702\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nPassenger $ 5,593 $ 2,777 $ 3,724 $ (2,353)\nMedical 3,851 3,346 13,784 8,249\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA 9,444 6,123 17,508 5,896\nReconciling items:\nAdjusted unallocated corporate expenses and software (5,264) (5,336) (15,916) (17,281)\ndevelopment (1)\nDepreciation and amortization (1,279) (1,843) (4,432) (5,305)\nStock-based compensation (5,345) (3,330) (15,434) (9,348)\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (299) 5,719 2,266 3,823\nRealized loss from sales of short-term investments — — — (95)\nInterest income 1,764 2,147 5,624 6,178\nLegal and regulatory advocacy fees (2)(3) (165) (217) (427) (640)\nExecutive severance costs (140) — (140) (265)\nSOX readiness costs (220) (145) (302) (180)\nContingent consideration compensation (earn-out) (4) — (2,700) — (5,361)\nM&A transaction costs (85) — (169) —\nImpairment of intangible assets — — (5,759) —\nRestructuring costs - Blade Europe (5) (483) — (483) —\n(Loss) income before income taxes $ (2,072) $ 418 $ (17,664) $ (22,578)\n(1) Includes costs that are not directly attributable to reportable segments such as finance, accounting, tax, information technology,\nhuman resources, legal costs and software development costs (primarily consists of staff and contractors costs), and excludes non-cash\nitems and certain transactions that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations.\n(2) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents legal advocacy fees related to the Drulias lawsuit (see “— Legal\nand Environmental” within Note 11) that we do not consider representative of legal and regulatory advocacy costs that we will incur\nfrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business.\n(3) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents certain legal and regulatory advocacy fees for certain proposed\nrestrictions at East Hampton Airport and potential operational restrictions on large jet aircraft at Westchester Airport, that we do not\nconsider representative of legal and regulatory advocacy costs that we will incur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.\n(4) Trinity’s contingent consideration, 2023 was the last year subject to an earn-out payment.\n(5) Includes severance, retention, legal and other one-time restructuring costs associated with a reorganization of Blade Europe.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nGoodwill\nPassenger $ 27,412 $ 27,045\nMedical 15,540 13,328\nTotal goodwill $ 42,952 $ 40,373\n20\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nGeographic Information\nRevenue by geography is based on where the flight’s operator is based.

The tax\nbenefit in the 2024 period is attributable to Blade Monaco. The difference in the tax benefit in the 2024 period compared to\nthe 2023 period is attributable to the mix of pretax profits from foreign operations and the mix of tax rates in those\njurisdictions, while no offsetting tax benefits arising from the Company’s U.S., Canada and France net operating losses.\nNote 9 – Net (Loss) Income per Common Share\nBasic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding, plus the impact of common shares, if dilutive, resulting from the exercise of\noutstanding stock options, restricted shares, and warrants.\n21\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nA reconciliation of net loss and common share amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted loss per common\nshare is presented below.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic and dilutive loss per common share:\nNet loss attributable to Blade Air Mobility, Inc. $ (1,954) $ 289 $ (17,514) $ (22,135)\nLess: Undistributed earnings allocated to nonvested\nrestricted stockholders — (22) — —\nBasic net earnings (loss) available to common (1,954) 267 (17,514) (22,135)\nstockholders\nAdd: Undistributed earnings allocated to nonvested\nrestricted stockholders — 22 — —\nLess: Reallocation of undistributed loss to\nnonvested restricted stockholders — (20) — —\nDiluted net earnings (loss) available to common\nstockholders $ (1,954) $ 269 $ (17,514) $ (22,135)\nTotal weighted-average basic common shares\noutstanding 78,044,254 74,139,422 77,151,361 73,108,263\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options — 6,867,437 — —\nTotal effect of dilutive securities — 6,867,437 — —\nTotal weighted-average diluted common shares\noutstanding 78,044,254 81,006,859 77,151,361 73,108,263\nNet (loss) income per common share:\nBasic (loss) earnings per common share $ (0.03) $ — $ (0.23) $ (0.30)\nDilutive (loss) earnings per common share $ (0.03) $ — $ (0.23) $ (0.30)\nThe following table represents common stock equivalents that were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per\ncommon share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 because the effect of their inclusion\nwould be anti-dilutive:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWarrants to purchase shares of common stock 14,166,644 14,166,644 14,166,644 14,166,644\nOptions to purchase shares of common stock 6,526,611 — 6,526,611 7,255,851\nRestricted shares of common stock 10,112,365 5,278,448 10,112,365 6,108,798\nTotal potentially dilutive securities 30,805,620 19,445,092 30,805,620 27,531,293\nNote 10 – Related Party Transactions\nThe Company occasionally engages in transactions for certain air charter services with jet operators who are part of the\nportfolio of RedBird Capital Partners Management LLC, which is an investor in the Company. Additionally, one member\nof the Company’s Board is a Partner of an affiliated company of RedBird Capital Partners Management LLC.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid these jet operators approximately $96 and\n$100, respectively for air charter services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid\nthese jet operators approximately $273 and $287, respectively for air charter services. These costs were recorded within\nCost of revenue on the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n22\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nNote 11 – Commitments and Contingencies\nCapacity Purchase Agreements\nBlade has contractual relationships with various aircraft operators to provide aircraft service. Under these CPAs, the\nCompany pays the operator contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights. The fees are generally based\non fixed hourly rates for flight time multiplied by hours flown. Under these CPAs, the Company is also responsible for\nlanding fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the operator to the Company without any markup or\ndirectly incurred by the Company.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has remaining unfulfilled obligations under agreements with various aircraft\noperators to provide aircraft service. The remaining unfulfilled obligation includes amounts within operating lease liability\nrelated to aircraft leases embedded within our capacity purchase agreements as discussed in Note 5 – Operating Right-of-\nUse Asset and Operating Lease Liability. These future unfulfilled obligations were as follows:\nTotal\nUnfulfilled Immediate Termination for\nFor the Year Ended December 31 Obligation Termination (1) Convenience (2)\nRemainder of 2024 $ 2,402 $ 176 $ —\n2025 15,378 8,740 2,835\n2026 12,055 5,417 —\n2027 9,234 2,596 —\n2028 6,638 — —\n2029 - 2032 (each year) 6,638 — —\n(1) Within total unfulfilled obligation, the following amounts are where Blade has the ability for immediate termination if a government\nauthority enacts travel restrictions.\n(2) Within total unfulfilled obligation, the following amounts are where Blade could terminate for convenience upon 60 days’ notice,\nwith a one-year annual minimum guarantee being pro-rated as of the termination date.\nLegal and Environmental\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business. Other than described\nbelow, we do not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management,\nhave a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. As of September 30, 2024,\nmanagement believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the information currently\navailable, the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience,\nthat the ultimate disposition of these other litigation and claims will not materially affect the Company's consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations. The Company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss\nis probable and reasonably estimable. These amounts are recorded based on the Company's assessments of the likelihood of\ntheir eventual disposition.\nIn February 2024, two putative class action lawsuits relating to the acquisition of Blade Urban Air Mobility, Inc. (“Old\nBlade”) were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On April 16, 2024, these cases were consolidated under the caption\nDrulias et al. v. Affeldt, et al., C.A. No. 2024-0161-SG (Del. Ch.) (“Drulias”). Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of\nfiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against the former directors of Experience Investment Corp. (“EIC” and such\ndirectors, the “EIC Directors”), the former officers of EIC, and Experience Sponsor LLC (“Sponsor”), and aiding and\nabetting breach of fiduciary duty claim against Sponsor. The operative complaint alleges, amongst other things, that the\nproxy statement related to the acquisition of Old Blade insufficiently disclosed EIC’s cash position, Old Blade’s value\nprospects and risks, and information related to Old Blade’s chief executive officer, who is also our current chief executive\nofficer. The consolidated complaints seeks, among other things, damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. Litigation is\nongoing. The Company believes that all claims in the lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously\nagainst them.\n23\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nNon-Cancellable Commitments with Vendors\nIn December 2023, the Company entered into a technology service agreement with a vendor for cloud computing services\nwhere we are committed to the remaining spend of $0.1 million, $1.1 million and $1.6 million for the years ending\nDecember 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nNote 12 – Warrant Liabilities\nOn May 7, 2021, the merger between Old Blade and EIC was consummated (the “Merger”). The warrants acquired in the\nMerger include (a) redeemable warrants issued by EIC and sold as part of the units in the EIC Initial Public Offering (“EIC\nIPO”) (whether they were purchased in the EIC IPO or thereafter in the open market), which are exercisable for an\naggregate of 9,166,644 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $11.50 per share (the “Public Warrants”) and (b)\nwarrants issued by EIC to Sponsor in a private placement simultaneously with the closing of the EIC IPO, which are\nexercisable for an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $11.50 per share (the “Private\nPlacement Warrants”).\nThe Company evaluated its warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and\nconcluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity. Accordingly, the Company classifies\nthe warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is\nsubject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the\nCompany’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations. See Note 13 – Fair Value Measurements\nfor additional information.\nWarrants — Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. The Public Warrants became\nexercisable on June 7, 2021. The Public Warrants will expire on May 7, 2026 or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nRedemptions of Warrants for Cash — The Company may redeem the Public Warrants:\n• in whole and not in part;\n• at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n• upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and\n• if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for\nany 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the\nnotice of redemption to each warrant holder.\nRedemption of Warrants for Shares of Common Stock — The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n• in whole and not in part;\n• at a price equal to a number of shares of common stock to be determined, based on the redemption date and the\nfair market value of the Company’s common stock;\n• upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption;\n• if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as\nadjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and the like) on the trading day prior\nto the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and\n• if, and only if, there is an effective registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon\nexercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating thereto is available throughout the 30-day period after\nthe written notice of redemption is given.\nIf the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption for cash, management will have the option to require all holders\nthat wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis”, as described in the warrant agreement. The\nexercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain\ncircumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation.\nHowever, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its\nexercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net-cash settle the warrants.\n24\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the initial public offering,\nexcept that the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable so long as they\nare held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees (unless the Company’s common stock equals or exceed $10\nper share and the Company redeems all the Public Warrants). If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other\nthan the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the\nCompany and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\nNote 13 – Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), for its financial assets and\nliabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities\nthat are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the\nCompany would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the\nliabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the\nfair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained\nfrom independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market\nparticipants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities\nbased on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a\nmarket in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide\npricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets\nfor similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs based on management’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability.\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation\ninputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value.\nLevel September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nWarrant liabilities - Public Warrants 1 $ 1,742 $ 3,208\nWarrant liabilities - Private Warrants 2 950 1,750\nFair value of aggregate warrant liabilities $ 2,692 $ 4,958\nThe Warrants were accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within “Warrant liability”\non the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue upon assumption and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within “Change in fair value of\nwarrant liabilities” in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Public Warrants are considered part of Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as those securities are traded on an active\npublic market. At May 7, 2021 and thereafter, the Company valued the Private Warrants using Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy. The Company used the value of the Public Warrants as an approximation of the value of the Private Warrants as\nthey are substantially similar to the Public Warrants, but not directly traded or quoted on an active market.\n25\nTable of Contents\nBLADE AIR MOBILITY, INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(amounts in thousands, except share, per share data and exchange rates)\nSubsequent Measurement\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities:\nPrivate Total\nPublic Placement Warrant\nWarrants Warrants Liability\nFair value as of January 1, 2024 $ 3,208 $ 1,750 $ 4,958\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (1,466) (800) (2,266)\nFair value as of September 30, 2024 $ 1,742 $ 950 $ 2,692\nNote 14 – Stockholders' Equity\nPreferred Stock\nThe Board of Directors of the Company is authorized to provide, out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock, for one or\nmore series of Preferred Stock and, with respect to each such series, to fix, without further stockholder approval, the\nnumber of shares constituting such series and the designation of such series, the powers (including voting powers),\npreferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions\nthereof, of such series of Preferred Stock. The powers (including voting powers), preferences and relative, participating,\noptional and other special rights of, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of each series of Preferred\nStock, if any, may differ from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. There was no preferred stock issued\nand outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn March 20, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program,\npursuant to which the Company may repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $20.0 million of the Company's\ncommon stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases. The Company’s stock\nrepurchase programs may be suspended, modified or discontinued by the Board at any time without prior notice at the\nCompany's discretion. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including\ncorporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and the Board’s (or its designees’) determination\nas to the appropriate use of our cash.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. During\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 80,102 shares of common stock in the open market.\nThe average price per share was $3.00, resulting in a total aggregate amount of approximately $244. All share repurchases\nhave been retired. There remains a potential repurchase capacity of approximately $19.8 million under the stock repurchase\nprogram that was announced on March 20, 2024.\nThe Company follows the cost method for accounting for stock repurchases. All shares repurchased to date have been\nretired by the Company, and there were no unsettled share repurchases. When the Company retires its own common stock,\nthe excess of the repurchase price over par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings\nsubject to certain limitations. The allocation to additional paid-in capital is determined by applying a percentage, calculated\nby dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares issued and outstanding as of the retirement date, to\nthe balance of additional paid-in capital as of the retirement date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $163 was\ndeducted from accumulated deficit, and $407 was deducted from additional paid-in capital, in relation to the retirement of\nthe common stock.\nNote 15 – Subsequent Events\nThe Company has completed an evaluation of all subsequent events through the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\nQ to ensure that these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include appropriate disclosure of\nevents both recognized in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and events which occurred but\nwere not recognized in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has concluded\nthat no subsequent event has occurred that requires disclosure.\n26\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

(“Blade” or the “Company”) provides air transportation and logistics for hospitals across the\nUnited States, where it is one of the largest transporters of human organs for transplant, and for passengers, with helicopter\nand fixed wing services primarily in the Northeast United States and Southern Europe. Based in New York City, Blade's\nasset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to\nfacilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft (“EVA” or “eVTOL”),\nenabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free.\nBlade operates in three key product lines across two segments (see Note 7 to the Unaudited Interim Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information on reportable segments):\n28\nTable of Contents\nPassenger segment\n• Short Distance – Consisting primarily of helicopter and amphibious seaplane flights in the United States and Europe\nbetween 10 and 100 miles in distance. Flights are available for purchase both by-the-seat and on a full aircraft charter\nbasis.\n• Jet and Other – Consists principally of revenues from non-medical jet charter and by-the-seat jet flights between New\nYork and South Florida (discontinued in November 2023), revenue from brand partners for exposure to Blade fliers\nand certain ground transportation services.\nMedical segment\n• MediMobility Organ Transport – Consisting primarily of transportation of human organs for transplant and/or the\nmedical teams supporting these services. Blade also offers additional services including donor logistics coordination\nand support evaluating potential donor organs through Trinity Organ Placement Services (“TOPS”), launched at the\nend of 2023.\nSeats Flown\nThe following table reflects the key operating metric we use to evaluate the Passenger segment:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSeats flown – all passenger flights 45,977 50,821 117,722 121,008\nWe define “Seats flown — all passenger flights” (Seats Flown) as the total number of seats purchased by paying passengers\non all flights, whether sold by-the-seat or within a charter arrangement. Our long-term consumer-facing strategy is\nprimarily focused on growth in by-the-seat products, and we believe that Seats Flown is an important indicator of our\nprogress in executing on this growth strategy. This metric is not always directly correlated with revenue given the\nsignificant variability in the price we charge per seat flown across our various products and routes. For products and routes\nsold by-the-seat, we fly significantly more passengers at a low price per seat; which is captured by Seats Flown. Passenger\nrevenue is heavily influenced by the Jet and Other product lines where we typically fly fewer passengers over long\ndistances at a high price. We believe the Seats Flown metric is useful to investors in understanding the overall scale of our\nPassenger segment and trends in the number of passengers paying to use our service.\nThe Activity in Canada ended on August 31, 2024. As a result, the three- and nine-month periods ending September 30,\n2024, and 2023 included two and eight months, and three and nine months, respectively, of Seats Flown activity in Canada.\nOur Business Model\nBlade leverages an asset-light business model: we primarily utilize aircraft that are owned and/or operated by third-parties\non Blade’s behalf. In these arrangements, pilots, maintenance, hangar, insurance, and fuel are all costs borne by our\nnetwork of operators, which provide aircraft flight time to Blade at fixed hourly rates. This enables our operator partners to\nfocus on training pilots, maintaining aircraft and flying, while we maintain the relationship with our customer from\nbooking through flight arrival. For flights offered for sale by-the-seat, Blade schedules flights based on demand analysis\nand takes the economic risk of aggregating fliers to optimize flight profitability, providing predictable margins for our\noperators.\nWhen utilizing third-party aircraft and/or aircraft operators, we typically pre-negotiate fixed hourly rates and flight times,\npaying only for flights actually flown, creating a predictable and flexible cost structure. Blade provides guaranteed flight\ncommitments to some of our third-party operators through capacity purchase agreements, which enable Blade to ensure\ndedicated access to such aircraft with enhanced crew availability, lower costs and, in many cases, the ability to unlock more\nfavorable rates when flying more than the minimum number of hours we guarantee to the operator. Additionally, a\nsignificant portion of Blade trips are flown by safety-vetted operators to whom Blade makes no commitments, providing us\nwith additional flexible capacity for high demand periods.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe also own a small number of fixed wing aircraft, operated and maintained by a third-party, that we utilize primarily for\nthe Medical segment. We prioritize the use of owned aircraft and dedicated aircraft under capacity purchase agreements,\nwhich provide better economies of scale. We size our owned fleet and our commitments under capacity purchase\nagreements significantly below our expected demand, enabling us to maximize utilization on those aircraft while fulfilling\nincremental demand through our network of non-dedicated operators.\nBlade’s proprietary “customer-to-cockpit” technology stack enables us to manage fliers and organ transports across\nnumerous simultaneous flights with multiple operators around the world. We believe that this technology, which provides\n(i) real-time tracking of organ transports and passenger flights; (ii) profit/loss information on a flight-by-flight basis; (iii)\ncustomized portals for all relevant parties including pilots, accounting teams, operator dispatch, transplant coordinators and\nBlade’s logistics team; and (iv) a customer-facing app for passenger missions, will enable us to continue to scale our\nbusiness. This technology stack was built with future growth in mind and is designed to allow our platform to be easily\nscaled to accommodate, among other things, rapid increases in volume, new routes, new operators, broader flight\nschedules, international expansion, next-generation verticraft and ancillary services (e.g., last/first-mile ground\nconnections, trip cancellation insurance, baggage delivery) through our mobile apps, website and cloud-based tools.\nOur asset-light business model was developed to be scalable and profitable using conventional aircraft today while\nenabling a seamless transition to EVA, once they are certified for public use. We intend to leverage the expected lower\noperating costs of EVA versus helicopters to reduce the consumer’s price for our flights. Additionally, we expect the\nreduced noise footprint and zero carbon emission characteristics of EVA to allow for the development of new, vertical\nlanding infrastructure (“vertiports”) in our existing and new markets.\nFactors Affecting our Performance\nAbility to attract and retain fliers in our Short Distance product line\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to cost-effectively attract new fliers, retain existing fliers, and increase\nutilization of our platform by existing fliers. Historically, we have made, and expect that we will need to continue to\nmake, significant investments and implement strategic initiatives in order to attract new fliers, such as flier acquisition\ncampaigns and the launching of new scheduled routes. These investments and initiatives may not be effective in\ngenerating sales growth or profits. In addition, marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in the\nacquisition of additional fliers in a cost-effective manner, if at all. As our brand becomes more widely known, future\nmarketing campaigns or brand content may not attract new fliers at the same rate as past campaigns or brand content. If we\nare unable to attract new fliers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur fliers have a wide variety of options for transportation, including business aviation, commercial airlines, private\naircraft operators, personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit, and ride-sharing offerings. To expand our flier base,\nwe must appeal to new fliers who have historically used other forms of transportation. If fliers do not perceive our urban\nair mobility services to be reliable, safe, and cost-effective, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features\non our platform, we may not be able to attract or retain fliers or increase their utilization of our platform. If we fail to\ncontinue to grow our flier base, retain existing fliers, or increase the overall utilization of our platform, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAbility to attract and retain customers in our MediMobility Organ Transport and Jet and Other product lines\nOur MediMobility Organ Transport product line primarily serves transplant centers, organ procurement organizations and\nhospitals (collectively, “Medical Customers”). Transportation for the hearts, lungs and livers that make up the vast majority\nof this product line is typically requested only hours before the required departure time. Our ability to successfully fulfill\nthese requests with consistent pricing on the requested aircraft type, be it jet, turboprop or helicopter, is the primary metric\nby which Medical Customers evaluate our performance.\nThe organ transportation market is highly competitive and we compete for organ transportation business primarily on our\nability to provide reliable, end-to-end air and ground transportation at competitive pricing. Increasingly, we compete\ndirectly with manufacturers of organ preservation equipment that also offer transportation or with providers that offer\nadditional services, such as surgical organ recovery, that our customers find valuable. We may face increased competition\nas our Medical Customers may prefer a streamlined logistics offering, including services or technology that we cannot\nprovide, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWe utilize the same aircraft and aircraft operators in the Jet and Other product line of our Passenger segment. Historically,\nthe combination of our Passenger and MediMobility Organ Transport demand, has been enough to incentivize operators to\nprovide dedicated aircraft and crews for our use. However, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to secure\ndedicated aircraft at favorable rates, particularly given significant increases in demand for private jet aircraft in the United\nStates in recent years. Periods of increased demand for private jets have historically led to increased charter costs and more\nlimited availability in the spot jet charter market. Although this has not limited our ability to maintain or increase our\naccess to dedicated jet aircraft at fixed prices in recent periods, jet charter, which makes up the majority of our Jet and\nOther product line, is highly competitive and volumes and pricing have historically been significantly influenced by overall\nmarket supply and demand.\nImpact of inflation to our business\nWe generally pay a fixed hourly rate to our third-party operators, based on flight hours flown. These rates are susceptible to\ninflation and are typically renegotiated on a yearly basis, though some multi-year contracts have fixed rate increases. Some\ncontracts with operators allow for pass-through of fuel price increases above a set threshold. For our owned aircraft, we are\nmore directly exposed to inflation of aircraft operating expenses, including pilot salaries, fuel, insurance, parts and\nmaintenance.\nWe have historically passed through cost inflation to customers and most contracts with our MediMobility Organ Transport\ncustomers automatically pass through any fuel surcharges, but there is no guarantee this will continue in the future.\nPassenger Expansion into New Geographic Markets\nOur Passenger segment growth plan is focused on dense urban areas, primarily those with existing air transportation\ninfrastructure that are facing increasing ground congestion. Growth in our Passenger segment will depend in part on our\nability to successfully enter into new markets, create and introduce new routes, and expand our existing routes by adding\nmore frequent flights. In these areas, our urban air mobility services can provide the most time savings for our fliers, and\ngiven the short distances involved, costs for our services can be comparable to luxury, private car services. Significant\nchanges to our existing routes or the introduction of new and unproven routes may require us to obtain and maintain\napplicable permits, authorizations, or other regulatory approvals. In addition, EVA may be commercially viable sooner in\nthese markets given that battery technology constraints may limit the range of early models. Large urban markets with\nexisting heliport infrastructure should be able to accommodate EVA while other cities may need several years to permit\nand build such infrastructure.\nIf these new or expanded routes are unsuccessful or fail to attract a sufficient number of fliers to be profitable, or we are\nunable to bring new or expanded routes to market efficiently, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected. Furthermore, new third-party aircraft operator or flier demands regarding our services,\nincluding the availability of superior routes or a deterioration in the quality of our existing routes, could negatively affect\nthe attractiveness of our platform and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to and\nadditional investments in our routes or our business model. The number of potential fliers using our urban air mobility\nservices in any market cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be\nable to operate in a profitable manner in any of our current or targeted future markets.\nDevelopment, approval and acceptance of EVA for commercial service\nWe intend to leverage the expected lower operating costs of EVA versus helicopters to reduce the price for our flights.\nAdditionally, we expect the reduced noise footprint and zero carbon emission characteristics of EVA to allow for the\ndevelopment of new vertiports in our existing and new markets. However, EVA involves a complex set of technologies,\nwhich we rely on original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to develop and our third-party aircraft operators to adopt.\nHowever, before EVA can fly passengers or cargo, OEMs must receive requisite approvals from federal transportation\nauthorities. No EVA aircraft are currently certified by the FAA for commercial operations in the United States, and there is\nno assurance that OEM research and development will result in government certified aircraft that are market-viable or\ncommercially successful in a timely manner, or at all. In order to gain government certification, the performance,\nreliability, and safety of EVA must be proven, none of which can be assured. Even if EVA aircraft are certified, individual\noperators must conform EVA aircraft to their licenses, which requires FAA approval, and individual pilots also must be\nlicensed and approved by the FAA to fly EVA aircraft, which could contribute to delays in any widespread use of EVA and\npotentially limit the number of EVA operators available to our business. There is no assurance that research and\n31\nTable of Contents\ndevelopment will result in government certified aircraft that are market-viable or commercially successful in a timely\nmanner, or at all.\nWe believe that Blade is well positioned to introduce EVA into commercial service, once available, for a number of\nreasons. In our Passenger segment, we believe our existing Short Distance routes will be compatible with EVA, which are\ninitially expected to have a limited range, and our existing terminal space will accommodate EVA. Additionally, we\nbelieve that the last-mile transports we perform using helicopters or ground vehicles in our Medical segment may be\ncompatible with EVA, reducing organ transport time and cost for our customers. Blade’s unit economics are designed to be\nprofitable using either conventional helicopters or EVA, even if early EVA do not deliver significant cost savings relative\nto helicopters. Moreover, Blade’s asset-light business model and technology platform are operator and aircraft agnostic,\nenabling a seamless transition to EVA.\nSeasonality\nPassenger segment\nHistorically, we have experienced significant seasonality in our Short Distance product line with flight volume peaking\nduring the quarters ended June 30 (Q2) and September 30 (Q3) of each fiscal year due to the busy summer travel season,\nwith lower volume during the first and fourth quarter (Q1 and Q4).\nJet and Other revenue has historically been stronger in the first and fourth quarter (Q1 and Q4) given that our by-the-seat\njet service between New York and South Florida has historically operated only between November and April. We\ndiscontinued this service in Q4 2023 and do not expect the seasonality in our Jet and Other revenue to be significant in\n2024.\nMedical segment\nHistorically, seasonality in our MediMobility Organ Transport product line has not been significant, though our trip\nvolumes are correlated with the overall supply of donor hearts, livers and lungs in the United States, which can be volatile\ndue to a variety of factors.\nKey Components of the Company’s Results of Operations\nRevenue\nShort Distance products are typically purchased using the Blade App and paid for principally via credit card transactions,\nwire, check, customer credit, and gift cards, with payments principally collected by the Company in advance of the\nperformance of related services. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed.\nJet products are typically purchased through our Flier Relations associates and our app and are paid for principally via\nchecks, wires and credit card. Jet payments are typically collected at the time of booking before the performance of the\nrelated service. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed.\nMediMobility Organ Transport products are typically purchased through our medical logistics coordinators and are paid for\nprincipally via checks and wires. Payments are generally collected after the performance of the related service in\naccordance with the client's payment terms. The revenue is recognized when the service is completed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and\nvehicles, ROU asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ ground transportation revenue using the\nCompany's owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator,\nmaintenance costs and pilot salaries.\n32\nTable of Contents\nSoftware Development\nSoftware development expenses consist primarily of staff costs, stock-based compensation costs and capitalized software\namortization costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses principally include staff costs including stock-based compensation, depreciation and\namortization, impairment of intangible assets, directors and officers insurance costs, pilot training costs for owned aircraft,\nprofessional fees, credit card processing fees and establishment costs. Depreciation of revenue-generating assets such as\naircraft and vehicles are included in Cost of revenue.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising costs, staff costs including stock-based compensation,\nmarketing expenses, sales commissions and promotion costs. The trend and timing of our brand marketing expenses will\ndepend in part on the timing of our expansion into new markets and other marketing campaigns.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 74,877 $ 71,442 $ 194,336 $ 177,702\nOperating expenses\nCost of revenue 55,040 55,863 148,006 144,590\nSoftware development 800 1,076 2,441 3,639\nGeneral and administrative 20,412 19,265 62,757 53,932\nSelling and marketing 2,162 2,686 6,686 8,025\nTotal operating expenses 78,414 78,890 219,890 210,186\nLoss from operations (3,537) (7,448) (25,554) (32,484)\nOther non-operating income (expense)\nInterest income 1,764 2,147 5,624 6,178\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (299) 5,719 2,266 3,823\nRealized loss from sales of short-term investments — — — (95)\nTotal other non-operating income 1,465 7,866 7,890 9,906\n(Loss) income before income taxes (2,072) 418 (17,664) (22,578)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (118) 129 (150) (443)\nNet (loss) income $ (1,954) $ 289 $ (17,514) $ (22,135)\n33\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nDisaggregated revenue by product line was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nProduct Line:\nShort Distance $ 32,352 $ 30,388 6 % $ 63,070 $ 59,997 5 %\nJet and Other 6,463 7,607 (15) % 20,837 23,092 (10) %\nMediMobility Organ Transport 36,062 33,447 8 % 110,429 94,613 17 %\nTotal Revenue $ 74,877 $ 71,442 5 % $ 194,336 $ 177,702 9 %\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue increased by $3.4 million or 5%, from $71.4 million in 2023\nto $74.9 million in 2024.\nShort Distance revenue increased by $2.0 million or 6%, from $30.4 million in 2023 to $32.4 million in 2024. Growth in Short\nDistance was primarily driven by growth in our Hamptons seasonal service for a $2.3 million increase, and increased volumes of\nNortheast helicopter charters for a $0.8 million increase. This was partially offset by the August 31, 2024 termination of our\nCanada routes for a $0.8 million decrease, and lower activity in Europe for a $0.4 million decrease.\nJet and Other revenue decreased by $1.1 million or (15)% from $7.6 million in 2023 to $6.5 million in 2024. The decline was\ndriven by a decrease in jet charters of $1.4 million, partially offset by the introduction of the new seasonal Hamptons Streamliner\nBus for a $0.3 million increase.\nMediMobility Organ Transport revenue increased by $2.6 million or 8% from $33.4 million in 2023 to $36.1 million in 2024.\nGrowth in MediMobility Organ Transport was driven primarily by growth in ground revenue for $1.8 million and $0.4 million for\nTOPS (TOPS was launched at the end of 2023), the remainder was due to new clients.\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue increased by $16.6 million or 9%, from $177.7 million in 2023\nto $194.3 million in 2024.\nShort Distance revenue increased by $3.1 million or 5% from $60.0 million in 2023 to $63.1 million in 2024. Growth in Short\nDistance was primarily driven by growth in our Hamptons seasonal service for a $2.2 million increase, growth in our New York\nairport transfer products, including annual pass activity, for a $1.0 million increase, and increased volumes of Northeast helicopter\ncharters for a $1.0 million increase. This was partially offset by lower activity and the termination of our Canada routes for a $1.1\nmillion decrease.\nJet and Other revenue decreased by $(2.3) million or (10)% from $23.1 million in 2023 to $20.8 million in 2024. $3.9 million\ndecrease is attributable to the discontinuation of our seasonal by-the-seat jet service between New York and South Florida. This\ndecrease was partially offset by a $0.9 million growth in jet charters, and higher brand partnership revenues and revenue from the\nintroduction of the new seasonal Hamptons Streamliner Bus in the current year period.\nMediMobility Organ Transport revenue increased by $15.8 million or 17% from $94.6 million in 2023 to $110.4 million in 2024.\nThe growth was driven primarily by: $6.6 million attributable to the addition of new hospital clients including of TOPS; higher\nrevenue from existing clients of $13.5 million (higher volumes, higher revenue per trip and higher ground revenue). Those\nincreases were partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease due to one temporary customer we supported only in the 2023 period.\nExcluding the impact of the temporary customer, revenue would have grown 22% versus the 2023 period.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenue\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCost of revenue $ 55,040 $ 55,863 (1) % $ 148,006 $ 144,590 2 %\nPercentage of revenue 74 % 78 % (4) % 76 % 81 % (5) %\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue decreased by $(0.8) million, or (1)% from $55.9\nmillion during 2023 to $55.0 million in 2024, driven by lower effective cost of revenue per flight (explained in the following\nparagraph), only partially offset by the higher volumes.\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenues decreased by 4 percentage points from 78% in 2023 to 74% in 2024. This change is\nattributable primarily to mix-shift to dedicated aircraft which operate at enhanced economies of scale in the Medical segment,\nhigher revenue per flight hour in the Medical segment and improved pricing along with improved load factor in our New York\nairport transfer and Hamptons by-the-seat products, as well as lower cost of revenue in Canada of $1.5 million impact (Canada\noperated at a loss in the prior year period with cost of revenue higher than revenue) due to our exit from the Canadian market on\nAugust 31, 2024.\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue increased by $3.4 million or 2%, from $144.6 million\nduring 2023 to $148.0 million during 2024 driven by increased flight volume.\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenues decreased by 5 percentage points from 81% in 2023 to 76% in 2024, attributable\nprimarily to: a mix-shift to dedicated aircraft in the Medical segment, which operate at enhanced economies of scale; increased\nrevenue per flight hour in our Medical segment; improved pricing with improved load factor in our Hamptons by-the-seat product\nand in our New York airport transfer products, New York airport products moved to profit from a loss position in the prior year\nperiod; and improved pricing in jet charter flights compared to the prior year period.\nSoftware Development\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nSoftware development $ 800 1,076 (26) % $ 2,441 3,639 (33) %\nPercentage of revenue 1 % 2 % 1 % 2 %\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, software development costs decreased by $(0.3) million, or (26)%,\nfrom $1.1 million during 2023 to $0.8 million in 2024, primarily due to software capitalization of development costs due to more\ndevelopment initiatives in the 2024 period.\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, software development costs decreased by $(1.2) million, or (33)%,\nfrom $3.6 million during 2023 to $2.4 million during 2024, primarily due to software capitalization of development costs due to\nmore development initiatives in the 2024 period for a $0.8 million impact, and a decrease of $0.4 million in stock-based\ncompensation costs.\n35\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nGeneral and administrative $ 20,412 $ 19,265 6 % $ 62,757 $ 53,932 16 %\nPercentage of revenue 27 % 27 % 32 % 30 %\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expense increased by $1.1 million, or 6%,\nfrom $19.3 million during 2023 to $20.4 million in 2024.\nThe primary drivers for the increase were a $2.1 million increase in stock-based compensation largely due to the PSUs granted in\nthe first quarter of the current year period; a $0.8 million increase in expenses related to the owned aircraft (acquired in the second\nquarter of 2024 and did not exist in the prior year period) as pilot training, hangar costs and insurance; a $0.7 million increase in\nstaff costs mostly attributable to the growth in our Medical segment; a $0.5 million charge for restructuring costs in Europe; and a\n$0.5 million increase in professional fees.

The increase was attributable to a $2.0 million increase in Short Distance offset by a\n$1.1 million decrease in Jet and Other. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under “—Comparison of the Three\nMonths Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023—Revenue” for more details.\nPassenger Adjusted EBITDA improved by $2.8 million or 101% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $2.8\nmillion in the same period of 2023 to $5.6 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable: to a $2.2 million impact\nfrom lower effective cost of revenue per flight in our New York airport transfer and Hamptons products (attributable to improved\npricing and load factor in the by-the-seat products) and in Europe; and a $0.7 million improvement in Canada, which moved from\na negative to a positive revenue less cost of revenue in the current year period compared to the prior year period (attributable to\nimproved load factor and our exit from the Canadian market on August 31, 2024).\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Passenger revenue increased by $0.8 million or 1% from $83.1 million\nin 2023 to $83.9 million in 2024. The increase was attributable to a $3.1 million increase in Short Distance that was partially\noffset by a $2.3 million decrease in Jet and Other. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under “—Comparison of\nthe Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023—Revenue” for more details.\nPassenger Adjusted EBITDA improved by $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $(2.4) million in the\nsame period of 2023 to $3.7 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable to higher revenue combined with lower\neffective cost of revenue per flight across all of Passenger flights (short distance and jet flights) compared to the prior year period\nfor a $4.9 million impact, attributable to improved pricing and improved load factor. Further improvements are attributable to a\n38\nTable of Contents\n$1.1 million decrease in marketing expenses and a $0.4 million decrease in personnel costs. These improvements were partially\noffset by a $0.4 million increase in staff costs.\nMedical segment\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Medical revenue increased by $2.6 million or 8%, from $33.4 million\nin 2023 to $36.1 million in 2024. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under “—Comparison of the Three Months\nEnded September 30, 2024 and 2023—Revenue” for more details.\nMedical Adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.5 million or 15%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $3.3 million\nin the same period of 2023 to $3.9 million in 2024. Due to: $1.3 million increase in revenue less cost of revenue (excluding\ndepreciation) due to higher volumes combined with lower effective cost of revenue per flight (due to higher revenue per flight\nhour and mix-shift towards dedicated aircraft operating at enhanced economies of scale). This increase was partially offset by a\n$0.8 million increase in fixed costs, primarily due to an increase in staff costs in order to support the higher activity and the new\nTOPS offering.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Medical revenue increased by $15.8 million or 17%, from $94.6\nmillion in 2023 to $110.4 million in 2024. Refer to the disaggregated revenue discussion above under “—Comparison of the Nine\nMonths Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023—Revenue” for more details.\nMedical Adjusted EBITDA increased by $5.5 million or 67%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $8.2 million in\nthe same period of 2023 to $13.8 million in 2024. $8.3 million of the increase is attributable to higher revenue less cost of revenue\n(excluding depreciation) due to: larger volumes combined with lower effective cost of revenue, attributable to: higher revenue per\nflight hour, mix-shift to dedicated aircraft and mix shift to ground revenue (which is characterized with lower effective cost of\nrevenue). This was partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in fixed costs, primarily staff costs in order to support the higher\nactivity, adding ground hubs and the new TOPS offering that did not exist in the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Flight Profit and Flight Margin\nThe following table presents our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Flight Profit and Flight Margin results:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) $ 4,180 $ 787 431 % $ 1,592 $ (11,385) NM(2)\nFlight Profit(1) $ 19,837 $ 15,579 27 % $ 46,330 $ 33,112 40 %\nFlight Margin(1) 26.5 % 21.8 % 23.8 % 18.6 %\n(1) See section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measure.\n(2) Percentage not meaningful.\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nAdjusted EBITDA improved by $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.8 million in the same period\nof 2023 to $4.2 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable to improvements in both Passenger and Medical\nAdjusted EBITDA (refer to the discussion above), coupled with a $0.1 million decrease in Adjusted unallocated corporate\nexpenses and software development staff costs.\nFlight Profit increased by $4.3 million or 27% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $15.6 million in the same\nperiod of 2023 to $19.8 million in 2024. The increase was driven by a 5% increase in revenue coupled with lower effective cost of\nrevenue per flight for both Passenger and Medical flights. In Passenger the lower effective cost of revenue per flight is attributable\nto improved pricing along with improved load factor in our US Short Distance flights, and a $0.7 million improvement in Canada\n(which operated at a negative Flight Profit in the prior year period). The lower effective cost of revenue per flight in Medical\nflights is attributable to higher revenue per flight hour and mix-shift to dedicated aircraft operating at enhanced economies of\nscale.\n39\nTable of Contents\nFlight Margin increased from 21.8% in the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 26.5% in the same period of 2023,\nattributable to lower effective cost of revenue per flight in both Passenger and Medical flights as described above under Flight\nProfit.\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nAdjusted EBITDA improved by $13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $(11.4) million in the same\nperiod of 2023 to $1.6 million in 2024. The improvement is primarily attributable to Adjusted EBITDA improvements of $6.1\nmillion and $5.5 million in Passenger and Medical, respectively (refer to the discussion above), coupled with a $1.4 million\ndecrease in Adjusted unallocated corporate costs and software development, attributable to a $1.0 million decrease in staff costs\nand a $0.5 million decrease in professional services and insurance.\nFlight Profit increased by $13.2 million or 40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $33.1 million in the same\nperiod of 2023 to $46.3 million in 2024. The increase was driven by a 9% increase in revenue coupled with lower effective cost of\nrevenue per flight across all of Passenger product lines (Short Distance and jet flights) compared to the prior year period\nattributable to improved pricing and improved load factor (in the by-the-seat products). In addition lower effective cost of revenue\nin Medical due to higher revenue per flight hour, mix-shift to dedicated aircraft and mix shift to ground revenue (which is\ncharacterized with lower effective cost of revenue).\nFlight Margin increased from 18.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.8% in the same period of 2024,\nattributable to lower effective cost of revenue per flight in both Passenger and Medical flights as described above under Flight\nProfit.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain non-GAAP measures included in this segment results of operations review have been derived from amounts calculated in\naccordance with GAAP but are not themselves GAAP measures. Blade believes that the non-GAAP measure discussed below,\nviewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. GAAP results, provide useful information to investors by providing a\nmore focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects,\nand allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision\nmaking. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other\ncompanies. These include Adjusted EBITDA, Flight Profit and Flight Margin, which we define, explain the use of and reconcile\nto the nearest GAAP financial measure below.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) stock-based compensation, (3)\nchange in fair value of warrant liabilities, (4) interest income and expense, (5) income tax, (6) realized gains and losses on short-\nterm investments, (7) impairment of intangible assets and (8) certain other non-recurring items (shown below) that management\ndoes not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results\nbetween periods.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet (loss) income $ (1,954) $ 289 $ (17,514) $ (22,135)\nAdd (deduct):\nDepreciation and amortization 1,279 1,843 4,432 5,305\nStock-based compensation 5,345 3,330 15,434 9,348\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 299 (5,719) (2,266) (3,823)\nRealized loss from sales of short-term investments — — — 95\nInterest income (1,764) (2,147) (5,624) (6,178)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (118) 129 (150) (443)\nLegal and regulatory advocacy fees (1)(2) 165 217 427 640\nExecutive severance costs 140 — 140 265\nSOX readiness costs 220 145 302 180\nContingent consideration compensation (earn-out) (3) — 2,700 — 5,361\nM&A transaction costs 85 — 169 —\nImpairment of intangible assets — — 5,759 —\nRestructuring costs - Blade Europe (4) 483 — 483 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 4,180 $ 787 $ 1,592 $ (11,385)\nRevenue $ 74,877 $ 71,442 $ 194,336 $ 177,702\nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 6 % 1 % 1 % (6) %\n(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents legal advocacy fees related to the Drulias lawsuit (see “— Legal and\nEnvironmental” within Note 11) that we do not consider representative of legal and regulatory advocacy costs that we will incur from time to\ntime in the ordinary course of our business.\n(2) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents certain legal and regulatory advocacy fees for certain proposed\nrestrictions at East Hampton Airport and the potential operational restrictions on large jet aircraft at Westchester Airport, that we do not consider\nrepresentative of legal and regulatory advocacy costs that we will incur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.

Flight Margin is calculated as Flight Profit divided by revenue. Flight\nProfit and Flight Margin are measures that management uses to assess the performance of the business. Blade believes that Flight\nProfit and Flight Margin provide a useful measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they\nfocus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with generating revenue such as third party variable costs and costs of\nowning and operating Blade’s owned aircraft.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross Profit, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Flight Profit, is calculated as revenue less cost of\nrevenue and other costs directly related to revenue generating transactions, including credit card processing fees, depreciation and\namortization, direct staff costs including stock-based compensation, commercial costs and establishment costs. Gross Margin is\ncalculated as Gross Profit divided by revenue. The reconciliation of Gross Profit to Flight Profit can be found in the table below.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue $ 74,877 $ 71,442 $ 194,336 $ 177,702\nLess:\nCost of revenue (1) 55,040 55,863 148,006 144,590\nDepreciation and amortization (2) 558 1,627 2,769 4,742\nStock-based compensation 36 44 149 124\nOther (3) 4,805 3,865 11,786 9,893\nGross Profit $ 14,438 $ 10,043 $ 31,626 $ 18,353\nGross Margin 19.3 % 14.1 % 16.3 % 10.3 %\nGross Profit $ 14,438 $ 10,043 $ 31,626 $ 18,353\nReconciling items:\nDepreciation and amortization (2) 558 1,627 2,769 4,742\nStock-based compensation 36 44 149 124\nOther (3) 4,805 3,865 11,786 9,893\nFlight Profit $ 19,837 $ 15,579 $ 46,330 $ 33,112\nFlight Margin 26.5 % 21.8 % 23.8 % 18.6 %\n(1) Cost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, ROU\nasset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ ground transportation revenue using the Company's owned vehicles and costs of\noperating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries.\n(2) Depreciation and amortization included within general and administrative expenses.\n(3) Other costs include credit card processing fees, direct staff costs, commercial costs and establishment costs.\n42\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total liquidity of $136.3 million and $166.1 million,\nrespectively, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $20.0 million and $27.9 million, respectively, and short-term\ninvestments of $116.3 million and $138.3 million, respectively.

The Company had net losses of $17.5 million and $22.1\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIn the course of our business, we have certain contractual relationships with third-party aircraft operators pursuant to which\nwe may be contingently required to make payments in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had commitments to\npurchase flights from various aircraft operators with aggregate minimum flight purchase guarantees of $2.4 million and\n$15.4 million for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively, $0.2 million and $8.7 million, respectively,\nof which may be cancelled by us immediately if a government authority enacts travel restrictions and $— million and $2.8\nmillion, respectively, of which could be terminated by Blade for convenience upon 60 days’ notice with the annual\nminimum guarantee being pro-rated as of the termination date. See “—Capacity Purchase Agreements” (“CPAs”) within\nNote 11 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information and for\ninformation about future periods. Additionally, the Company has operating lease obligations related to real estate and\nvehicles with expected annual minimum lease payments of $0.4 million and $2.0 million for the years ending December\n31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. See Note 5 “Right-of-Use Asset and Operating Lease Liability” to the unaudited interim\ncondensed consolidated financial statements for additional information and for information about future periods.\nWe have non-cancellable commitments which primarily relate to cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. The amounts are determined based on the non-cancellable quantities to which we are contractually obligated. In\nDecember 2023, the Company entered into a technology service agreement with a vendor for cloud computing services\nwhere we are committed to spend $0.1 million and $1.1 million for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively.\nOn March 20, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to\nwhich the Company may repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $20.0 million of the Company's common\nstock, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company repurchased $0.2 million of common stock pursuant to this program ending with a\nremaining potential repurchase capacity under the program of approximately $19.8 million. No shares were repurchased in\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of\nfactors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s\ndetermination as to the appropriate use of our cash. Our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we\nintend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash.\nWe expect to incur net losses in the short term, as we continue to execute our strategic initiatives. Based on our current\nliquidity, we believe that no additional capital will be needed to execute our current business plan over the next 12 months.\nOur longer term liquidity requirement will depend on many factors including the pace of our expansion into new markets,\nour ability to attract and retain customers for our existing products, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (767) $ (23,029)\nNet cash (used in) / provided by investing activities (4,992) 17,014\nNet cash used in financing activities (1,885) (53)\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash balances 29 (81)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (7,615) (6,149)\nCash Used In Operating Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $0.8 million, driven by a net loss\nof $17.5 million and $3.2 million of cash used for working capital requirements, adjusted for non-cash items consisting of\nstock-based compensation expense of $15.4 million, impairment of intangible assets of $5.8 million, depreciation and\namortization of $4.4 million, non-cash accretion of interest income on held-to-maturity securities of $3.1 million and\nincome from change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $2.3 million. The $3.2 million of cash used for working capital\nrequirements was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.3 million, driven by the\ncash payment for the Trinity contingent consideration compensation and for the 2023 short term incentive plan paid in\nMarch of 2024, an increase in accounts receivable of $3.6 million (attributable to the revenue growth in the Medical\nsegment) and a decrease in deferred revenue of $0.2 million (driven by Passenger client prepayments and gift cards);\npartially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $8.3 million (driven by the utilization of $9.3\nmillion of prepaid deposits under CPAs with M&N as part of the purchase of the seven aircraft, slightly offset by new\nprepayments made to operators in connection with new CPAs) and a decrease in other non-current assets of $0.5 million (a\nlease deposit refund).\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $23.0 million, primarily driven by\na net loss of $22.1 million and $6.8 million cash used for working capital requirements, adjusted for non-cash items\nconsisting of stock-based compensation expense of $9.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $5.3 million, non-cash\naccretion of interest income on held-to-maturity securities of $4.7 million, income from change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities of $3.8 million, realized loss of $0.1 million from the sale of short-term investments, and a deferred tax benefit of\n$0.4 million. The $6.8 million cash used for working capital requirements was primarily driven by an increase in accounts\nreceivable of $10.4 million, due to the rapid growth in the Medical segment, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets of $1.1 million, driven by prepayments to operators in connection with capacity purchase agreements;\npartially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.1 million, and an increase in lease liabilities\nof $0.4 million.\nCash (Used In) / Provided by Investing Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $5.0 million, driven by $168.0\nmillion of proceeds from maturities of held-to-maturity investments offset by $142.8 million in purchases of held-to-\nmaturity investments; $26.3 million in purchases of property and equipment, consisting primarily of $22.8 million in the\nacquisition of ten aircraft and related capitalized costs to support the Medical segment, with the remaining in furniture and\nfixtures for new office space in Arizona used by the Medical segment, and purchase of vehicles used in generating revenue\nby the Medical segment; $2.2 million in consideration paid for the acquisition of CJK and $1.7 million in capitalized\nsoftware development costs.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was $17.0 million, driven by\n$20.5 million of proceeds from sales of other short-term investments; $264.5 million of proceeds from maturities of held-\nto-maturity investments, partially offset by $265.8 million in purchases of held-to-maturity investments; $0.1 million in\npurchases of other short-term investments; and $2.1 million in purchases of property and equipment, consisting of\nleasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for lounges used by the Passenger segment, and vehicles used in\ngenerating revenue by the Medical segment.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCash Used In Financing Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 million, reflecting $1.8\nmillion cash paid for payroll tax payments on behalf of employees in exchange for shares withheld by the Company (“net\nshare settlement”) and $0.2 million in repurchases and retirement of common stock under the share repurchase program\nannounced March 20, 2024; partially offset by $0.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $0.05 million, primarily reflecting\n$0.1 million cash paid for payroll tax payments made on behalf of employees in exchange for shares withheld by the\nCompany (“net share settlement”), partially offset by $0.06 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\nin the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. In\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions\nthe Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions.\nFor information on the Company’s significant accounting policies and estimates refer to “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and\nEstimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material\nchanges to these policies and estimates as of September 30, 2024.\nItem 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\nThere have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in \"Item 7A. Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls\nand procedures, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the\nCompany in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to management,\nincluding our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nWe determined that our internal control over financial reporting had the following material weaknesses:\n• A lack of effective IT General Controls in relation to:\n◦ user access controls that adequately restrict user access to financial applications, programs and data\naffecting underlying accounting records, and\n◦ the change management controls for certain operational applications that ensure IT program and data\nchanges are identified, tested, authorized and implemented properly.\n• A number of control deficiencies in relation to the revenue process that, although not individually material in\nnature, in aggregate constitute a material weakness.\nManagement has concluded that these deficiencies may impact the Company’s financial reporting such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis and represent a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting.\n45\nTable of Contents\nBecause disclosure controls and procedures include those components of internal control over financial reporting that\nprovide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management also determined that its disclosure controls and\nprocedures were not effective as a result of the above-mentioned material weaknesses in its internal control over financial\nreporting.\nNotwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the unaudited interim condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with GAAP.\nManagement’s Plans for Remediation\nWe have identified and implemented, and continue to implement, certain remediation efforts to improve the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. These remediation efforts are ongoing and include the following measures\nto address the material weaknesses identified:\n• We have completed controls testing to enable management to assess the operating effectiveness of the change\nmanagement controls for the Company’s main operational IT application and we are in the process of\nimplementing those same change management controls for our other operational IT applications.\n• We are re-enforcing procedures on proper user access administration and the need for timely documentation of\nassociated requests and approvals.\n• We have designed additional controls to supplement the existing business process controls in relation to revenues,\nwith these controls implemented in Q3 2024.\nWe expect the above actions will be completed before the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The material\nweaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and\nmanagement has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. As we continue to evaluate and\nimprove the applicable controls, management may take additional remedial measures or modify the remediation plan\ndescribed above.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than the specific remediation steps discussed above, there were no other changes in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting in the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024.\nLimitations on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAn internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nTherefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial\nstatement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to\nthe risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting\nprocess. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\n46\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Based in New York City, Blade's asset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to facilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft (“EVA” or “eVTOL”), enabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free. \n\nFor more information, visit [www.blade.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aaqUKKV0SPQ559MRoW-9jK5c_iqpXXZep10EU3d9LLYwo_InN8NrJy2jjNeczbfI9lNLRAmJoTNQymXCF6NPHQ==). \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of words such as \"will\", “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “continue,” “expect,” “estimate,” “may,” “plan,” “outlook,” “future” and “project” and other similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable and may also relate to Blade’s future prospects, developments and business strategies. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements concerning Blade’s future financial and operating performance, results of operations, business and capital deployment strategies and plans, customer behavior, competitive position, industry environment and growth opportunities, and the development and adoption of EVA technology. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside Blade’s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include: our continued incurrence of significant losses; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects, failure of the markets for our offerings to grow as expected, or at all; our ability to effectively market and sell air transportation as a substitute for conventional methods of transportation; the inability or unavailability to use or take advantage of the shift, or lack thereof, to EVA technology; our ability to successfully enter new markets and launch new routes and services; any adverse publicity stemming from accidents involving small aircraft, helicopters or charter flights and, in particular, any accidents involving our third-party operators; the effects of competition; harm to our reputation and brand; our ability to provide high-quality customer support; our ability to maintain a high daily aircraft usage rate; changes in consumer preferences, discretionary spending and other economic conditions; impact of natural disasters, outbreaks and pandemics, economic, social, weather, growth constraints, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances on metropolitan areas and airports where we have geographic concentration; the effects of climate change, including potential increased impacts of severe weather and regulatory activity; the availability of aircraft fuel; our ability to address system failures, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our website, applications, backend systems or other technology systems or those of third-party technology providers; interruptions or security breaches of our information technology systems; our placements within mobile applications; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our use of open source software; our ability to expand and maintain our infrastructure network; our ability to access additional funding; the increase of costs and risks associated with international expansion; our ability to identify, complete and successfully integrate future acquisitions; our ability to manage our growth; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage; the loss of key members of our management team; our ability to maintain our company culture; our reliance on contractual relationships with certain transplant centers and Organ Procurement Organizations; effects of fluctuating financial results; our reliance on third-party operators; the availability of third-party operators; disruptions to third party operators; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage for our third-party aircraft operators; the possibility that our third-party aircraft operators may illegally, improperly or otherwise inappropriately operate our branded aircraft; our reliance on third-party web service providers; changes in our regulatory environment; regulatory obstacles in local governments; the expansion of domestic and foreign privacy and security laws; the expansion of environmental regulations; our ability to remediate any material weaknesses or maintain internal controls over financial reporting; our ability to maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls; changes in the fair value of our warrants; and other factors beyond our control. Additional factors can be found in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, each as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and Blade undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changes in expectations, future events or otherwise. We are unable to reconciled forward-looking non-GAAP guidance, including Flight Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, and Adjusted EBITDA, without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs, the most significant of which are incentive compensation, transaction-related expenses, and certain value measurements, which may have unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Contacts** For Media RelationsLee Gold [press@blade.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QXWdIAmFBmNvI0lEE1SRYGpNSkX_omaCp9SLAXVj92GgzxhLrdyHSWw7OFBKUY0KZh6aaOWNM1fHN_JyHrQ6pA==)\n\nFor Investor RelationsMat Schneider[investors@blade.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4iuqW0NvAQCGJWh1HdvFGLUSbH24WibPBljjQtPenOicGMcZlZpPeJm9qhaxEzLXcIPx7IGj79R8F9h-ISwT3Pta-_dDFGyJkqrqSueIHgg=)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/4d7d47b8-59af-4dd7-ab46-e196ea963c92/small/blade1-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4d7d47b8-59af-4dd7-ab46-e196ea963c92)\n\nSource: Blade Air Mobility, Inc. \n\nReleased November 29, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.blade.com/news-events/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n"

Given the FAA's recent release of the necessary guidelines for future operations as well as the incoming administration’s stated agenda of achieving adoption ahead of other countries, we believe the timeline for this transition has greater clarity.\"\n\n\"We're pleased to see great conversion of Adjusted EBITDA to Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which improved to $3.7 million in Q3 2024, approximately three times the prior year period, demonstrating the cash benefits of our drive to Passenger profitability and the growth in Medical,\" said Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer. \"Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA improved 15.1% with margins expanding 70 basis points in Q3 2024 versus the prior year, despite a softer than expected Q3 for US organ transplant volumes. Regardless, October was one of the highest revenue months for Medical in company history and we continue to take market share, including two recent customer wins for high-volume transplant centers that we expect to begin flying in the coming months.\"\n\nHeyburn added, \"We are also excited to announce a strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to their _metra_ perfusion device. We know from speaking with our customers that demand for _metra_ currently exceeds the supply of available machines. This partnership will enable higher utilization of available _metra_ devices through rapid distribution, utilizing Blade's air and ground logistics, to transplant centers who need them on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\n\"During the quarter, we acquired two additional aircraft which we expect to enter service by early 2025, bringing our owned fleet to ten,\" said Melissa Tomkiel, President. \"Our aircraft ownership strategy is already bearing fruit, enabling us to win new medical contracts in recent months that required asset ownership. However, lower medical flight volumes in Q3 led to negative operating leverage while above average expenses on our owned aircraft fleet, including entry into service delays, did lead to lower Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 2024 versus Q2 2024. Though quarter to quarter lumpiness in volumes and maintenance expenses may happen from time to time, we have already seen a normalization in the performance of our owned fleet Q4 to date.\"\n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenue increased 4.8% to $74.9 million in the current quarter versus $71.4 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by growth in Medical and Short Distance partially offset by Jet and Other.\n  * Flight Profit _(_ 1) increased 27.3% to $19.8 million in the current quarter versus $15.6 million in the prior year period, driven by strong growth in both the Medical and Passenger segments.\n  * Flight Margin _(_ 1) improved to 26.5% in the current quarter from 21.8% in the prior year period, driven primarily by a strong summer season in the Northeast, improved profitability in New York Airport and benefits from restructuring actions taken in Europe and Canada in Passenger.\n  * Medical revenue increased 7.8% to $36.1 million in the current quarter versus $33.4 million in the prior year period. Medical revenue decreased (5.9)% sequentially versus Q2 2024 driven primarily by air trip volume that declined in line with industry transplant volumes, and a reduction in block hours per air trip as we increased the size of our dedicated fleet and positioned these aircraft closer to our largest hospital clients. This strategy reduces empty leg repositioning, improving outcomes and increasing economic efficiency for our customers while fortifying our value proposition to hospitals and making many other operators uncompetitive in these regions.\n  * Short Distance revenue increased 6.5% to $32.4 million in the current quarter versus $30.4 million in the prior year period. Excluding Canada, which was discontinued, Short Distance revenue increased 9.8% versus the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by Northeast Leisure, Other Short Distance and New York Airport.\n  * Jet and Other revenue decreased 15.0% to $6.5 million in the current quarter versus $7.6 million in the prior year period driven by a decline in revenue per flight as charter industry pricing normalized.\n  * Net loss increased by $2.2 million versus the prior year to $(2.0) million in Q3 2024 driven primarily by a $6.0 million decrease in non-cash income from change in fair value of warrant liability, partially offset by a $3.9 million reduced loss from operations.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA _(_ 1) improved by $3.4 million year-over-year to $4.2 million in the current quarter versus $0.8 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a $2.8 million improvement in Passenger Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Medical Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.5 million year-over-year and Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses and Software Development decreased (1.3)% versus the prior year period.\n  * Operating Cash Flow increased by $4.3 million to $6.4 million in Q3 2024. Capital expenditures of $9.9 million were driven primarily by the $7.3 million purchase of aircraft in the Medical segment. Free Cash Flow, Before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is net of all capital expenditures, including aircraft maintenance expenses, but excludes the impact of aircraft acquisitions, increased by $2.4 million to $3.7 million in Q3 2024.\n  * Ended Q3 2024 with $136.3 million in cash and short term investments.\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights and Recent Updates**\n\n  * Announced strategic alliance with OrganOx to broaden access to OrganOx's _metra_ normothermic machine perfusion device. The _metra_ device extends liver preservation times, aiding the identification of viable donor livers, enabling longer-distance transportation and increasing the utilization of donor organs. OrganOx will preposition _metra_ devices at strategic locations across the United States, utilizing air and ground logistics from Blade's wholly-owned subsidiary, Trinity Medical, to enable rapid deployment to transplant centers.\n  * Seven of the eight previously announced aircraft acquisitions operated in Q3 2024, with the eighth aircraft entering service in October. We signed agreements to acquire two additional aircraft during Q3 2024 that are expected to enter service by early 2025. With a fleet size of ten, our owned fleet will only represent approximately one third of our Medical flying hours with the majority remaining on third-party aircraft.\n  * Medical's organ placement service offering (\"TOPS\") continues to gain market share with five contracted customers today and a strong sales pipeline.\n  * Completed an acquisition in Medical that expands our captive ground network and fleet of vehicles that will enable us to better serve our New York area customers.\n  * Restructured our European operations which is expected to improve profitability and enable stronger organizational and commercial alignment with our local partner.\n  * Completed exit from Canada in our Passenger business.\n\n\n\n(1) See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Information\" sections attached to this release for an explanation of Non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\n**Financial Outlook****(****1****)**\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue of $240 million to $250 million\n  * Positive Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect:\n\n  * Double-digit Medical revenue growth\n  * Passenger revenue of $85 million to $95 million\n  * Double-digit millions of Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call starting at 8:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 to discuss the results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nA live audio-only webcast of the call may be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://ir.blade.com/. An archived replay of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website for one year.\n\n(1) We have not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance included above to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs, the most significant of which are incentive compensation (including stock-based compensation), transaction-related expenses, certain fair value measurements, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nBlade believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") results, provide useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses, SG&A, Adjusted SG&A, Flight Profit, Flight Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the tables within this press release.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA – Blade reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Blade defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income and expense, income tax, realized gains and losses on short-term investments, impairment of intangible assets and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nAdjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses – Blade defines Adjusted Unallocated Corporate Expenses as expenses that cannot be allocated to either of our reporting segments (Passenger and Medical) and therefore attributable to our Corporate expenses and software development, less non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nSG&A and Adjusted SG&A – Blade defines SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue. Blade defines Adjusted SG&A as total operating expenses excluding cost of revenue and excluding non-cash items and certain other non-recurring items that management does not believe are indicative of ongoing Company operating performance and would impact the comparability of results between periods.\n\nFlight Profit and Flight Margin – Blade defines Flight Profit as revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of flight costs paid to operators of aircraft and vehicles, landing fees, depreciation of aircraft and vehicles, right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset amortization, internal costs incurred in generating organ ground transportation revenue using the Company’s owned vehicles and costs of operating our owned aircraft including fuel, management fees paid to the operator, maintenance costs and pilot salaries. Blade defines Flight Margin for a period as Flight Profit for the period divided by revenue for the same period. Blade believes that Flight Profit and Flight Margin provide an important measure of the profitability of the Company's flight and ground operations, as they focus solely on the non discretionary direct costs associated with those operations such as third party variable costs and costs of owning and operating Blade's owned aircraft.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions – Blade defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Blade also reports Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions, which is Free Cash Flow excluding cash outflows for aircraft acquisitions. Blade believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisitions provide important insights into the cash-generating capability of the business, with Free Cash Flow, before Aircraft Acquisition specifically highlighting the cash generated by our core operations before the impact of discretionary strategic investments in new aircraft.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n**BLADE AIR

Based in New York City, Blade's asset-light model, coupled with its exclusive passenger terminal infrastructure and proprietary technologies, is designed to facilitate a seamless transition from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to Electric Vertical Aircraft (“EVA” or “eVTOL”), enabling lower cost air mobility that is both quiet and emission-free. \n\nFor more information, visit www.blade.com.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of words such as \"will\", “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “continue,” “expect,” “estimate,” “may,” “plan,” “outlook,” “future,” \"target,\" and “project” and other similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable and may also relate to Blade’s future prospects, developments and business strategies. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements concerning Blade’s future financial and operating performance (including the discussion of 2024 and 2025 financial outlook and guidance), the composition and performance of its fleet, results of operations, industry environment and growth opportunities, new product lines and partnerships, and the development and adoption of EVA technology. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside Blade’s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include: our continued incurrence of significant losses; failure of the markets for our offerings to grow as expected, or at all; our ability to effectively market and sell air transportation as a substitute for conventional methods of transportation; reliance on certain customers in our Passenger segment revenue; the inability or unavailability to use or take advantage of the shift, or lack thereof, to EVA technology; our ability to successfully enter new markets and launch new routes and services; any adverse publicity stemming from accidents involving small aircraft, helicopters or charter flights and, in particular, any accidents involving our third-party operators; any change to the ownership of our aircraft and the challenges related thereto; the effects of competition; harm to our reputation and brand; our ability to provide high-quality customer support; our ability to maintain a high daily aircraft usage rate; changes in consumer preferences, discretionary spending and other economic conditions; impact of natural disasters, outbreaks and pandemics, economic, social, weather, geopolitical, growth constraints, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances on metropolitan areas and airports where we have geographic concentration; the effects of climate change, including potential increased impacts of severe weather and regulatory activity; the availability of aircraft fuel; our ability to address system failures, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our website, applications, backend systems or other technology systems or those of third-party technology providers; interruptions or security breaches of our information technology systems; our placements within mobile applications; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our use of open source software; our ability to expand and maintain our infrastructure network; our ability to access additional funding; the increase of costs and risks associated with international expansion; our ability to identify, complete and successfully integrate future acquisitions; our ability to manage our growth; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage; the loss of key members of our management team; our ability to maintain our company culture; our reliance on contractual relationships with certain transplant centers and Organ Procurement Organizations; effects of fluctuating financial results; our reliance on third-party operators; the availability of third-party operators; disruptions to third-party operators; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage for our third-party aircraft operators; the possibility that our third-party aircraft operators may illegally, improperly or otherwise inappropriately operate our branded aircraft; our reliance on third-party web service providers; changes in our regulatory environment; risks and impact of any litigation we may be subject to; regulatory obstacles in local governments; the expansion of domestic and foreign privacy and security laws; the expansion of environmental regulations; our ability to remediate any material weaknesses or maintain internal controls over financial reporting; our ability to maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls; changes in the fair value of our warrants; and other factors beyond our control.

Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of words such as \"will\", “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “continue,” “expect,” “estimate,” “may,” “plan,” “outlook,” “future” and “project” and other similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable and may also relate to Blade’s future prospects, developments and business strategies. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements concerning Blade’s future financial and operating performance, results of operations, business and capital deployment strategies and plans, customer behavior, competitive position, industry environment and growth opportunities, and the development and adoption of EVA technology. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside Blade’s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include: our continued incurrence of significant losses; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects, failure of the markets for our offerings to grow as expected, or at all; our ability to effectively market and sell air transportation as a substitute for conventional methods of transportation; the inability or unavailability to use or take advantage of the shift, or lack thereof, to EVA technology; our ability to successfully enter new markets and launch new routes and services; any adverse publicity stemming from accidents involving small aircraft, helicopters or charter flights and, in particular, any accidents involving our third-party operators; the effects of competition; harm to our reputation and brand; our ability to provide high-quality customer support; our ability to maintain a high daily aircraft usage rate; changes in consumer preferences, discretionary spending and other economic conditions; impact of natural disasters, outbreaks and pandemics, economic, social, weather, growth constraints, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances on metropolitan areas and airports where we have geographic concentration; the effects of climate change, including potential increased impacts of severe weather and regulatory activity; the availability of aircraft fuel; our ability to address system failures, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our website, applications, backend systems or other technology systems or those of third-party technology providers; interruptions or security breaches of our information technology systems; our placements within mobile applications; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our use of open source software; our ability to expand and maintain our infrastructure network; our ability to access additional funding; the increase of costs and risks associated with international expansion; our ability to identify, complete and successfully integrate future acquisitions; our ability to manage our growth; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage; the loss of key members of our management team; our ability to maintain our company culture; our reliance on contractual relationships with certain transplant centers and Organ Procurement Organizations; effects of fluctuating financial results; our reliance on third-party operators; the availability of third-party operators; disruptions to third party operators; increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage for our third-party aircraft operators; the possibility that our third-party aircraft operators may illegally, improperly or otherwise inappropriately operate our branded aircraft; our reliance on third-party web service providers; changes in our regulatory environment; regulatory obstacles in local governments; the expansion of domestic and foreign privacy and security laws; the expansion of environmental regulations; our ability to remediate any material weaknesses or maintain internal controls over financial reporting; our ability to maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls; changes in the fair value of our warrants; and other factors beyond our control. Additional factors can be found in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, each as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and Blade undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changes in expectations, future events or otherwise. We are unable to reconciled forward-looking non-GAAP guidance, including Flight Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, and Adjusted EBITDA, without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs, the most significant of which are incentive compensation, transaction-related expenses, and certain value measurements, which may have unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Contacts** Media RelationsLee Gold[Press@Blade.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kMTg_bb2Hp6MlT9JtjFJC1i2YAG5G6IZGIgFjVKqxDdfW8qH2w74VS5s48WDwUjGyEPY1T-rkzpy1fOu1i9Jmg==)\n\nInvestor RelationsMathew Schneider[Investors@blade.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PrrhT8JYNnUlTkpxx5c7p02DY-pQtfnHDPkln-3zBxfZoaDumiusKMdaaK_F0cG8ag3Q2a31QBHTYJEu1UOp8jecS-kgRFCpKmTw9DRJ4gc=)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/4d7d47b8-59af-4dd7-ab46-e196ea963c92/small/blade1-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4d7d47b8-59af-4dd7-ab46-e196ea963c92)\n\nSource: Blade Air Mobility, Inc. \n\nReleased October 29, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.blade.com/news-events/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n"
