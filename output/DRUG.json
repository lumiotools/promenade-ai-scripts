Bright Minds Biosciences to Present…\n\n\n\n  * _Poster presentations on BMB-101 will focus on 5-HT 2C functional selectivity and Phase 1 clinical data – _\n\n\n\n**NEW YORK, November 21, 2024** – Bright Minds Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ: DRUG), a pioneering company focused on developing highly selective 5-HT2 agonists for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, depression, and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders, is proud to announce two upcoming presentations at the American Epilepsy Society 2024 Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, December 6-10, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s presentation details are as follows:\n\n**Title** : Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Ascending Oral Doses of novel 5-HT2C agonist, BMB-101, in Fed and Fasted Adult Healthy Human Volunteers **Poster Number** : 1.532\n\n**Presenter(s):** Jan Torleif Pedersen, Chief Scientific Officer\n\n**Presentation date and location** : Poster Session 1, Saturday, December 7, 12:00 PM – 2:00 PM. South Hall H, Level 1\n\n**Title** : BMB-101 and Biased 5-HT2C Agonism: A Novel Approach for Sustained Epilepsy Management **Poster Number** : 1.533\n\n**Presenter(s):** Alex Vasilkevich, Chief Operating Officer\n\n**Presentation date and location** : Poster Session 1, Saturday, December 7, 12:00 PM – 2:00 PM. South Hall H, Level 1\n\n### **About BMB-101**\n\nBMB-101 is a novel scaffold 5-HT2CGq-protein biased agonist developed using structure-based drug design. It was explicitly designed for chronic treatment of neurological disorders where tolerance and drug resistance are common issues. Biased agonism at the 5-HT2C receptor is one of its key features and adds another layer of functional selectivity within a well-validated target. BMB-101 works exclusively via the Gq-protein signaling pathway and avoids beta-arrestin activation, which is crucial to minimize the risk of receptor desensitization and tolerance development. This provides a novel mechanism, anti-epileptic drug designed to provide sustained seizure relief in hard-to-treat patient populations. In preclinical studies, BMB-101 has demonstrated efficacy in animal models of Dravet Syndrome and numerous models of generalized seizures.\n\nIn Phase 1 clinical studies, BMB-101 was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated at all doses. No Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were observed, and Adverse Events (AEs) were mild in nature and in line with on-target effects for serotonergic drugs. An extensive target-engagement study was conducted using both fluid biomarkers (transient prolactin release) and physical biomarkers (Quantitative Electroencephalogram, qEEG). Both methods confirmed robust central target engagement. A qEEG signature typical for anti-epileptic drugs was observed, with a selective depression of EEG power at frequencies observed during epileptic seizures. Furthermore, a potentiation of frontal gamma-power was observed in this study which could indicate the potential for improved cognition.\n\nOn September 12th, Bright Minds Biosciences announced the initiation of the BREAKTHROUGH Study, an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BMB-101in adult patients with classic Absence Epilepsy and Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE).\n\n### **About Bright Minds Biosciences**\n\nBright Minds Biosciences is a biotechnology company developing innovative treatments for patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. Our pipeline includes novel compounds targeting key receptors in the brain to address conditions with high unmet medical need, including epilepsy, depression, and other CNS disorders.

[Home](https://brightmindsbio.com/ \"Home\")\n  2. [Press Release](https://brightmindsbio.com/category/press-release/ \"Press Release\")\n  3. Bright Minds Biosciences and Firefly…\n\n\n\n**NEW YORK AND VANCOUVER, October 21, 2024** – Bright Minds Biosciences Inc. (Bright Minds or the Company)(NASDAQ: DRUG), a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, today announced that it is once again collaborating with [Firefly Neuroscience, Inc.](https://fireflyneuro.com/) (Firefly) (NASDAQ: AIFF), an Artificial Intelligence (AI) company developing innovative solutions that improve brain health outcomes for patients with neurological and mental disorders, to provide a full analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG)data in the Company’s BREAKTHROUGH study, an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BMB-101, a highly selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist, in adult patients with classic Absence Epilepsy and Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE).\n\nBright Minds and Firefly have previously collaborated successfully to analyze the data of the Company’s first-in-human Phase 1 study of BMB-101 using Firefly’s advanced artificial intelligence, FDA-cleared BNA™ technology platform.\n\nThe BREAKTHROUGHstudy is designed as a basket clinical trial that will include patients diagnosed with either Absence Epilepsy (with or without Eyelid Myoclonia) or DEE. This group of disorders consists of a range of rare epilepsy disorders, including Epilepsy with Eyelid Myoclonia (known as Jeavons Syndrome). These conditions are characterized by refractory seizures that are often resistant to current treatments. The BREAKTHROUGH study istargeting enrollment of 20 adult participants aged from 18 to 65 years old.\n\n“After successful use of the BNA platform to analyze the data from our Phase 1 study, we look forward to once again collaborating with the Firefly team at the conclusion of our Phase 2 program for our lead compound, BMB-101, to provide valuable insights into the EEG recordings during the study,” said Ian McDonald, Chief Executive Officer of Bright Minds Biosciences. “We believe BMB-101 has the potential to be a best-in-class 5-HT2C agonist. This compound is not only poised to make a significant impact in both the DEE and Absence Epilepsy communities, but also has broad applicability across the 30% of all epilepsy patients who experience drug resistance.”\n\n**About BMB-101**\n\n**BMB-101** is a novel scaffold 5-HT2CGq-protein biased agonist developed using structure-based drug design. It was explicitly designed for chronic treatment of neurological disorders where tolerance and drug resistance are common issues. Biased agonism at the 5-HT2C receptor is one of its key features and adds another layer of functional selectivity within a well-validated target. BMB-101 works exclusively via the Gq-protein signaling pathway and avoids beta-arrestin activation, which is crucial to minimize the risk of receptor desensitization and tolerance development. This provides a novel mechanism, anti-epileptic drug designed to provide sustained seizure relief in hard-to-treat patient populations. In preclinical studies, BMB-101 has demonstrated efficacy in animal models of Dravet Syndrome and numerous models of generalized seizures.\n\nIn Phase 1 clinical studies, BMB-101 was given to 64 healthy volunteers in a Single Ascending Dose (SAD), Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) and food-effects study. BMB-101 was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated at all doses. No Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were observed, and Adverse Events (AEs) were mild in nature and in line with on-target effects for serotonergic drugs.\n\nAn extensive target-engagement study was conducted using both fluid biomarkers (transient prolactin release) and physical biomarkers (Quantitative Electroencephalogram, qEEG). Both methods confirmed robust central target engagement. A qEEG signature typicalfor anti-epileptic drugs was observed, with a selective depression of EEG power at frequencies observed during epileptic seizures. Furthermore, a potentiation of frontal gamma-power was observed in this study which could indicate the potential for improved cognition.\n\n**About Bright Minds Biosciences**\n\nBright Minds Biosciences is a biotechnology company developing innovative treatments for patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. Our pipeline includes novel compounds targeting key receptors in the brain to address conditions with high unmet medical need, including epilepsy, depression, and other CNS disorders.

[Home](https://brightmindsbio.com/ \"Home\")\n  2. [Press Release](https://brightmindsbio.com/category/press-release/ \"Press Release\")\n  3. Bright Minds Biosciences to Present…\n\n\n\nVancouver, BC – March 8, 2022 – Bright Minds Biosciences (“Bright Minds,” “BMB” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: DRUG) (CSE: DRUG), a biotechnology company focused on developing novel drugs for the targeted treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy, and pain, today announced that Company managementwill present virtually at the Oppenheimer 32nd Annual Healthcare Conference as follows:\n\nDate: Thursday, March 17, 2022\n\nTime: 2:00PM ET\n\nWebcast: [Click here](https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer20/drug.cn/3326526)\n\nAn archived replay of the presentation will be available on the Company’s website immediately following the conference and will be available for 90 days at: [**http://localhost/brightminds/investors/**](http://localhost/brightminds/investors/)\n\n## **About BMB-101**\n\nBMB-101, a 5-HT2C selective and biased agonist, has demonstrated compelling activity in a host of _in-vitro_ and _in-vivo_ non-clinical tests. Compared to Locaserin, BMB-101 exhibits strong Gq signaling coupled with minimal Arrestin recruitment. Mechanistically, Serotonin (5- Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter widely expressed in the central nervous system, and drugs modulating 5-HT have made a major impact in mental health disorders. Central 5-HT systems have long been associated with the control of ingestive behavior and the modulation of behavioral effects of psychostimulants, opioids, alcohol and nicotine. Over the past decade, the various 5-HT receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized. Results of clinical trials and animal studies indicate that 5-HT2C up receptor agonists may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of addiction by decreasing the intake of opioids as well as impulsive behavior that can escalate compulsive drug use.\n\n## **About Dravet Syndrome**\n\nDravet syndrome is an epilepsy syndrome that begins in infancy or early childhood and can include a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Children with Dravet initially show focal (confined to one area) or generalized (throughout the brain) convulsive seizures that start before 15 months of age (often before age one). These initial seizures are often prolonged and involve half of the body, with subsequent seizures that may switch to the other side of the body. These initial seizures are frequently provoked by exposure to increased temperatures or temperature changes, such as getting out of a bath. Other seizure types emerge after 12 months of age and can be quite varied. Status epilepticus – a state of continuous seizure requiring emergency medical care – may occur frequently in these children, particularly in the first five years of life. Dravet syndrome affects an estimated 1:15,700 individuals in the U.S., or 0.0064% of the population (Wu 2015). Approximately 80-90% of those, or 1:20,900 individuals, have both an SCN1A mutation and a clinical diagnosis of DS. This represents an estimated 0.17% of all epilepsies. As an area of high, unmet medical need, there currently exist only three FDA-approved medications for the treatment of DS: (1) Fintepla® (fenfluramine), which has a black-box label; (2) Diacomit® (stiripentol) and (3) Epidolex® (cannabidiol).\n\n## **About Mental Disease**\n\nIn the U.S., 1 in 4 adults experience some form of mental disease, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while 1 in 24 has a serious mental disease, and 1 in 12 has [**substance use disorder**](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-mental-illness), with [**comorbidities**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2720421)being common. Depression is the single largest contributor to global disability and leads to 800,000 [**suicide deaths per year**](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254610/WHO-MSD-MER-2017.2-eng.pdf). Major depressive disorder impacts 300 million people worldwide, and 100 million of these are [**resistant to current treatments**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25969470/). Treatment resistant depression causes higher mortality than treatable depression and medical costs are [**2 to 3 times greater**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31583010/). One in 11 people will be diagnosed with [**PTSD**](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/ptsd/what-is-ptsd)during their lifetime. Drugs to treat mental diseases globally were worth $37 billion in 2020, and the market is projected to grow to $59 billion by [**2031**](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/11/2245922/0/en/Mental-Disorder-Drugs-Market-size-worth-US-58-91-Billion-by-2031-Visiongain-Research-Inc.html). Serotonin (5-HT) is one of the most important neurotransmitters influencing mental health and is a target for [**next-generation pharmacological treatments**](https://www.everydayhealth.com/serotonin/guide/).\n\n## **About Bright Minds**\n\nBright Minds is focused on developing novel transformative treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy, and pain. Bright Minds has a portfolio of next-generation serotonin agonists designed to target neurocircuit abnormalities that are responsible for difficult to treat disorders such as resistant epilepsy, treatment resistant depression, PTSD, and pain. The Company leverages its world-class scientific and drug development expertise to bring forward the next generation of safe and efficacious drugs. Bright Minds’ drugs have been designed to potentially retain the powerful therapeutic aspects of psychedelic and other serotonergic compounds, while minimizing the side effects, thereby creating superior drugs to first-generation compounds, such as psilocybin.\n\n## **Investor Contacts:**\n\nLisa Wilson\n\nFounder & President\n\nIn-Site Communications, Inc.\n\n489 Fifth Avenue, 29th Floor\n\nNew York, NY 10017\n\nE: lwilson@insitecony.com\n\nJosh Blacher\n\nVice President, Corporate Development\n\nBright Minds Biosciences, Inc.\n\n19 Vestry Street\n\nNew York, NY 10013\n\nE: josh@brightmindsbio.com\n\nCategory: [Press Release](https://brightmindsbio.com/category/press-release/)[By admin](https://brightmindsbio.com/author/admin/ \"View all posts by admin\")[March 9, 2022](https://brightmindsbio.com/2022/03/09/ \"5:40 am\")\n\n#### Author: admin\n\n<http://localhost/brightminds>\n\n### Related Posts\n\n[](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-to-present-data-at-the-american-epilepsy-society-2024-annual-meeting/)\n\n[Bright Minds Biosciences to Present Data at the American Epilepsy Society 2024 Annual Meeting](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-to-present-data-at-the-american-epilepsy-society-2024-annual-meeting/)November 21, 2024\n\n[](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-closes-us35-million-non-brokered-private-placement/)\n\n[BRIGHT MINDS BIOSCIENCES CLOSES US$35 MILLION NON-BROKERED PRIVATE PLACEMENT](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-closes-us35-million-non-brokered-private-placement/)November 4, 2024\n\n[](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-and-firefly-neuroscience-to-collaborate-after-the-breakthrough-study-a-phase-2-trial-of-bmb-101-in-absence-epilepsy-and-developmental-epileptic-encephalopathy-for-full-analys/)\n\n[Bright Minds Biosciences and Firefly Neuroscience to Collaborate After the BREAKTHROUGH Study: A Phase 2 Trial of BMB-101 in Absence Epilepsy and Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy for Full Analysis of EEG Data](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-and-firefly-neuroscience-to-collaborate-after-the-breakthrough-study-a-phase-2-trial-of-bmb-101-in-absence-epilepsy-and-developmental-epileptic-encephalopathy-for-full-analys/)October 21, 2024\n\n[](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-announces-us35-million-non-brokered-private-placement/)\n\n[BRIGHT MINDS BIOSCIENCES ANNOUNCES US$35 MILLION NON-BROKERED PRIVATE PLACEMENT](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-announces-us35-million-non-brokered-private-placement/)October 18, 2024\n\n[](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-proprietary-compound-bmb-201-5-ht2c-2a-mixed-agonist-demonstrated-similar-efficacy-to-morphine-in-preclinical-pain-models/)\n\n[Bright Minds Biosciences proprietary compound, BMB-201, 5-HT2C/2A mixed agonist, demonstrated similar efficacy to morphine in preclinical pain models](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-proprietary-compound-bmb-201-5-ht2c-2a-mixed-agonist-demonstrated-similar-efficacy-to-morphine-in-preclinical-pain-models/)October 16, 2024\n\n[](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-announces-participation-in-the-upcoming-scientific-conferences-and-partnering-events/)\n\n[Bright Minds Biosciences announces participation in the upcoming scientific conferences and partnering events](https://brightmindsbio.com/bright-minds-biosciences-announces-participation-in-the-upcoming-scientific-conferences-and-partnering-events/)October 3, 2024\n\n[Go to Top](#)\n\n![img](https://brightmindsbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bright-Minds-5.jpg) ×\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nName*\n\nEmail*\n\nI am a*\n\nPlease SelectRetail InvestorInstitutional InvestorAcademic Researcher\n\nNotifications\n"

Effective November 8, the shares will commence trading under the ticker symbol “DRUG.” Bright Minds will continue to maintain the listing of its Shares on the Canadian Stock Exchange (“CSE”) under the symbol “DRUG.”\n\n“Our listing on Nasdaq marks an important corporate milestone for Bright Minds, as we continue to advance our innovative drug candidates in pursuit of an improved generation of targeted serotonin-based therapies,” stated Ian McDonald, CEO and Co-founder of Bright Minds Biosciences. “With encouraging preclinical data across several indications, we are progressing toward first-in-human trials with our lead drug candidate, BMB-101, for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a devastating congenital and genetic disease affecting the nervous system.We expect to commence the trials in the first half of 2022.”\n\n“Bright Minds is also committed to delivering significant returns to our shareholders. Trading on the world’s most liquid market in which all investors can participate helps us continue to actualize that objective. We look forward to continuing to work closely with all our key constituents – scientific, medical, and the capital markets – to bolster our excellent competitive positioning,” concluded Mr. McDonald.\n\n**About Bright Minds**\n\nBright Minds is focused on developing novel transformative treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy and pain.
