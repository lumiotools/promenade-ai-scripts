(\"Qurate Retail\") (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) today announced the payment of a semi-annual interest payment and Regular Additional Distribution to the holders as of November 1, 2024 of the 4.0% Senior Exchangeable Debentures due 2029 (the \"Debentures\") issued by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty Interactive LLC (“LI LLC”).The semi-annual interest payment amount is $20.00 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures (a “Debenture”), and the amount of the Regular Additional Distribution is $0.4302 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures. \n\nUnder the Indenture for the Debentures, the original principal amount of the Debentures is reduced by an amount equal to each Extraordinary Additional Distribution made to holders of the Debentures. Thereafter, the adjusted principal amount is further reduced on each successive semi-annual interest payment date to the extent necessary to cause the semi-annual interest payment to represent the payment of an annualized yield of 4.0% of the adjusted principal amount. This latter adjustment, to the extent it is made by reason of a particular Extraordinary Additional Distribution that results in an adjustment to the principal amount of the Debentures, takes effect on the second succeeding interest payment date after the payment of that Extraordinary Additional Distribution. \n\nTo date, there has been one Extraordinary Additional Distribution to holders of the Debentures. On August 7, 2013, LI LLC made an Extraordinary Additional Distribution of $63.0960 per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures arising from the merger transaction between Sprint Nextel Corporation and SoftBank Corp. \n\nAdjustments to the principal amount of the Debentures do not affect the amount of the semi-annual interest payments received by holders of the Debentures, which will continue to be a rate equal to 4.0% per annum of the original principal amount of the Debentures. Below is a detail of the amount of the semi-annual interest payment being made on the Debentures announced today, its allocation between payment of interest and repayment of principal and the revised adjusted principal amount resulting from such payment, per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures: \n\nNovember 15, 2024 Beginning Adjusted Principal  |  Total  Payment  |  Interest  |  Additional Payment of Principal  |  November 15, 2024 Ending Adjusted Principal   \n---|---|---|---|---  \n$904.3676  |  $20.0000  |  $18.0874  |  $1.9126  |  $902.4550   \n  \nLI LLC is also making a Regular Additional Distribution to holders of the Debentures as of November 1, 2024 of $0.4302 per Debenture, which is attributable to the regular quarterly cash dividend paid by T-Mobile US, Inc. of $0.65 per share on June 13, 2024 and September 12, 2024. The payment of the Regular Additional Distribution will not result in a reduction to the adjusted principal amount of the Debentures. \n\nThe semi-annual interest payment and Regular Additional Distribution are expected to be paid on November 15, 2024 to holders of record of the Debentures on November 1, 2024. \n\nOn April 1, 2020, T-Mobile US, Inc. completed its acquisition of Sprint Corporation (“TMUS/S Acquisition”) for 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile US, Inc. for every share of Sprint Corporation. Following the TMUS/S Acquisition, the reference shares attributable to each $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures consist of 0.3309 shares of common stock of T-Mobile US, Inc. (Nasdaq: TMUS) and 0.7860 shares of common stock of Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: LUMN). \n\n**About Qurate Retail, Inc.**\n\nQurate Retail, Inc. is a Fortune 500 company comprised of six leading retail brands – QVC®, HSN®, Ballard Designs®, Frontgate®, Garnet Hill® and Grandin Road® (collectively, “Qurate Retail GroupSM”).

(\"Qurate Retail\") (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) today reported third quarter 2024 results(1). \n\n“While the third quarter was anticipated to be the most difficult quarter of 2024, current headline events and the challenging macro-economic climate heavily impacted viewership of our programming and consumer behavior more than expected,” said David Rawlinson, President and CEO of Qurate Retail. “As a result, revenue underperformed this quarter and resulted in meaningful bottom-line deleverage. Despite this, we were able to hold consolidated gross margin flat with disciplined cost management and reduced operating expenses. We also continued our proactive balance sheet management, completing an offer in which 89% of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 notes were tendered which improves the QVC credit profile with reduced debt and an extended maturity profile. \n\n“We are nearing the end of our multi-year Project Athens initiative focused on margin and free cash flow. The team has materially improved the business, becoming a more profitable, leaner and more nimble organization. We are transitioning to the next phase of our strategic growth as we enhance our capabilities to reach aggregated audiences on primarily social and streaming platforms.” \n\nThird quarter 2024 headlines: \n\n  * Qurate Retail revenue decreased 5% in both US Dollars and constant currency(2)\n  * Generated $152 million in operating income \n  * Adjusted OIBDA(3) decreased 12% in both US Dollars and constant currency to $250 million \n  * QxH revenue decreased 6% \n  * QVC International revenue decreased 1% in both US Dollars and constant currency \n  * Cornerstone revenue decreased 12% \n  * Tendered 89% of QVC, Inc.’s 2027 and 2028 notes \n    * Partially funded with $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 \n    * Improves QVC credit position with reduced debt balance and extended maturity profile \n\n\n\nDiscussion of Results\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**Revenue**  \nQxH  |  $  |  1,617  |  $  |  1,521  |  (6  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  577  |  571  |  (1  |  )%  |  (1  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  285  |  252  |  (12  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Revenue** |  **2,479** |  **2,344** |  **(5** |  **)%** |  **(5** |  **)%**  \n**Operating Income (Loss)**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  91  |  $  |  107  |  18  |  %   \nQVC International  |  63  |  57  |  (10  |  )%  |  (8  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  4  |  (2  |  )  |  NM   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (7  |  )  |  (10  |  )  |  (43  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Operating Income** |  **151** |  **152** |  **1** |  **%** |  **1** |  **%**  \n**Adjusted OIBDA**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  201  |  $  |  182  |  (9  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  77  |  70  |  (9  |  )%  |  (9  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  11  |  6  |  (45  |  )%   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (4  |  )  |  (8  |  )  |  (100  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **250** |  **(12** |  **)%** |  **(12** |  **)%**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount, NC fulfillment center (“Rocky Mount”) in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs. These items are included in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA. See Reconciling Schedule 2.   \n  \n**QxH**\n\nQxH revenue declined due to a 6% decrease in units shipped as well as lower shipping and handling revenue, partially offset by favorable returns. QxH reported declines in all categories. \n\nOperating income increased in the third quarter comparing against $19 million of one-time net restructuring costs and penalties incurred in the prior year period. \n\nAdjusted OIBDA margin(3) decreased due to fulfillment (warehouse and freight) pressure and sales deleverage, partially offset by higher product margins. Fulfillment pressure was driven by higher fulfillment center wages and freight rates and deleverage, partially offset by increased productivity efficiencies. Operating expenses decreased 6% due to lower commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% driven by lower personnel expense and outside services costs, partially offset by increased marketing costs due to brand marketing to support QVC’s Age of Possibility campaign. \n\n**QVC International**\n\nQVC International’s constant currency revenue decreased primarily due to a 3% decrease in average selling price, partially offset by a 1% increase in units shipped and favorable returns. QVC International reported constant currency growth in home and accessories, with a decline in apparel and beauty. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased primarily due to higher fulfillment costs and lower product margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Fulfillment costs increased due to higher freight rates and fulfillment center wages. Product margins decreased reflecting lower initial margin due to product mix and higher ocean freight rates, partially offset by favorable returns. \n\nUS Dollar denominated results were not materially impacted by exchange rate fluctuations. The Dollar weakened 3% against the British Pound, 1% against the Euro and strengthened 3% against the Japanese Yen. The financial metrics presented in this press release also provide a comparison of the percentage change in QVC International’s results in constant currency to the comparable figures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, where applicable. \n\n**Cornerstone**\n\nCornerstone revenue decreased, reflecting softness and competitive promotional pressure in the home sector. Cornerstone is implementing a transformation plan to improve its revenue and profitability given the continued challenges in the housing sector. Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased mainly due to higher costs for outside services related to its transformation plan and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower supply chain costs. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL METRICS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions unless otherwise noted)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**QxH**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  65.4  |  %  |  65.5  |  %  |  10  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)(b) |  5.6  |  %  |  7.0  |  %  |  140  |  bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)(b) |  12.4  |  %  |  12.0  |  %  |  (40  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  $  |  51.78  |  $  |  51.76  |  0  |  %   \nUnits Sold  |  (6  |  )%   \nReturn Rate(c) |  15.4  |  %  |  14.6  |  %  |  (80  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  996  |  $  |  967  |  (3  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  61.6  |  %  |  63.6  |  %  |  200  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.0  |  %  |  70.7  |  %  |  170  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  8.2  |  7.9  |  (4  |  )%   \n**QVC International**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  63.4  |  %  |  64.6  |  %  |  120  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  10.9  |  %  |  10.0  |  %  |  (90  |  )bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  13.3  |  %  |  12.3  |  %  |  (100  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  (3  |  )%  |  (3  |  )%   \nUnits Sold  |  1  |  %   \nReturn Rate(c) |  19.6  |  %  |  18.9  |  %  |  (70  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  283  |  $  |  297  |  5  |  %  |  5  |  %   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  49.0  |  %  |  52.0  |  %  |  300  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.3  |  %  |  76.1  |  %  |  680  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  4.2  |  4.0  |  (5  |  )%   \n**Cornerstone**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  62.8  |  %  |  59.9  |  %  |  (290  |  )bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  1.4  |  %  |  NM  |  NM   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  3.9  |  %  |  2.4  |  %  |  (150  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  218  |  $  |  188  |  (14  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  76.5  |  %  |  74.6  |  %  |  (190  |  )bps   \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of Rocky Mount in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

It is subject to mandatory redemption on March 15, 2031. The Preferred Stock is considered a liability for GAAP purposes, and is recorded net of capitalized costs.   \nd)  |  As defined in QVC’s credit agreement. A portion of expected cost savings are included in Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of the covenant calculations under QVC’s bank credit facility.   \n  \nCash at Qurate Retail decreased $337 million in the third quarter primarily due to net debt repayment and capital expenditures during the period. On September 26, 2024, QVC completed an offer in which 89% of its 4.75% senior secured notes due 2027 and 4.375% senior secured notes due 2028 were tendered. The transaction was funded by $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 and $352 million of cash. Total debt at Qurate Retail decreased $299 million in the third quarter due to the repurchase of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 senior secured notes, partially offset by the issuance of the new 2029 senior secured notes and additional net borrowing under QVC’s bank credit facility. \n\nQVC’s bank credit facility has $1.3 billion drawn as of September 30, 2024 with incremental availability of $1.8 billion, net of letters of credit. QVC’s leverage ratio, as defined by the QVC revolving credit facility, was 3.1x at quarter-end. Pursuant to the terms of QVC’s revolving credit facility, a portion of expected cost savings are included in operating income for purposes of QVC’s leverage ratio for covenant calculations. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, QVC’s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC’s senior secured notes) was greater than 3.5x and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments. Dividends made by QVC to service the principal and interest of indebtedness of its parent entities, as well as payments made by QVC to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries, are permitted under the bond indenture and credit agreement. \n\nQurate Retail is in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**Important Notice:** Qurate Retail, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) will discuss Qurate Retail’s earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 8:30 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024. The call can be accessed by dialing (877) 704-4234 or (215) 268-9904, passcode 13744091, at least 10 minutes prior to the start time.

Links to this press release and replays of the call will also be available on Qurate Retail’s website. \n\n_This press release includes certain forward-looking statements, including statements about business strategies and initiatives (including Project Athens and Cornerstone’s transformation plan) and their expected benefits, market potential, future financial performance and prospects and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, possible changes in market acceptance of new products or services, competitive issues, regulatory matters affecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms acceptable to Qurate Retail, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of investment opportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of future public health crises), issues impacting the global supply chain and labor market and use of social media and influencers. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and Qurate Retail expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Qurate Retail's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Qurate Retail, including the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, for additional information about Qurate Retail and about the risks and uncertainties related to Qurate Retail's business which may affect the statements made in this press release._\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for Qurate Retail, QVC (and certain of its subsidiaries) and Cornerstone together with a reconciliation to that entity or such businesses’ operating income, as determined under GAAP. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified impairments, litigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire related costs, net (including Rocky Mount inventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale leaseback transactions. Further, this press release includes Adjusted OIBDA margin, which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as Adjusted OIBDA divided by revenue. \n\nQurate Retail believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’s performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Qurate Retail views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Qurate Retail's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. Please see the attached schedules for applicable reconciliations. \n\nThis press release also references certain financial metrics on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, for Qurate Retail. Constant currency financial metrics, as presented herein, are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. \n\nQurate Retail believes constant currency financial metrics are an important indicator of financial performance, in particular for QVC, due to the translational impact of foreign currency fluctuations relating to its subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Italy and Japan. We use constant currency financial metrics to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Please see the financial tables at the beginning of this press release for a reconciliation of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue, operating income, Adjusted OIBDA and average selling price. \n\nSCHEDULE 1 \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Qurate Retail’s Adjusted OIBDA to its operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively. \n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME AND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  4Q23  |  1Q24  |  2Q24  |  3Q24   \n**Qurate Retail Operating Income (Loss)** |  $  |  151  |  $  |  (103  |  )  |  $  |  145  |  $  |  165  |  $  |  152   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  105  |  98  |  99  |  96  |  95   \nStock compensation expense  |  10  |  13  |  16  |  3  |  3   \nRestructuring, penalty and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) (including Rocky Mount inventory losses)(a) |  19  |  —  |  —  |  18  |  —   \nImpairment of intangible assets(b) |  —  |  326  |  —  |  —  |  —   \n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and sale leaseback transactions(c) |  —  |  6  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  —   \n**Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **340** |  **$** |  **259** |  **$** |  **282** |  **$** |  **250**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount fulfillment center in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

These items are included in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA.   \nb)  |  In the fourth quarter of 2023, QxH recognized a $326 million non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill.   \nc)  |  Includes a loss related to the sale leaseback of a German property in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a gain related to the sale leaseback of a German property in the first quarter of 2024.

(\"Qurate Retail\") (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) today reported third quarter 2024 results(1). \n\n“While the third quarter was anticipated to be the most difficult quarter of 2024, current headline events and the challenging macro-economic climate heavily impacted viewership of our programming and consumer behavior more than expected,” said David Rawlinson, President and CEO of Qurate Retail. “As a result, revenue underperformed this quarter and resulted in meaningful bottom-line deleverage. Despite this, we were able to hold consolidated gross margin flat with disciplined cost management and reduced operating expenses. We also continued our proactive balance sheet management, completing an offer in which 89% of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 notes were tendered which improves the QVC credit profile with reduced debt and an extended maturity profile. \n\n“We are nearing the end of our multi-year Project Athens initiative focused on margin and free cash flow. The team has materially improved the business, becoming a more profitable, leaner and more nimble organization. We are transitioning to the next phase of our strategic growth as we enhance our capabilities to reach aggregated audiences on primarily social and streaming platforms.” \n\nThird quarter 2024 headlines: \n\n  * Qurate Retail revenue decreased 5% in both US Dollars and constant currency(2)\n  * Generated $152 million in operating income \n  * Adjusted OIBDA(3) decreased 12% in both US Dollars and constant currency to $250 million \n  * QxH revenue decreased 6% \n  * QVC International revenue decreased 1% in both US Dollars and constant currency \n  * Cornerstone revenue decreased 12% \n  * Tendered 89% of QVC, Inc.’s 2027 and 2028 notes \n    * Partially funded with $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 \n    * Improves QVC credit position with reduced debt balance and extended maturity profile \n\n\n\nDiscussion of Results\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**Revenue**  \nQxH  |  $  |  1,617  |  $  |  1,521  |  (6  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  577  |  571  |  (1  |  )%  |  (1  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  285  |  252  |  (12  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Revenue** |  **2,479** |  **2,344** |  **(5** |  **)%** |  **(5** |  **)%**  \n**Operating Income (Loss)**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  91  |  $  |  107  |  18  |  %   \nQVC International  |  63  |  57  |  (10  |  )%  |  (8  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  4  |  (2  |  )  |  NM   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (7  |  )  |  (10  |  )  |  (43  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Operating Income** |  **151** |  **152** |  **1** |  **%** |  **1** |  **%**  \n**Adjusted OIBDA**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  201  |  $  |  182  |  (9  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  77  |  70  |  (9  |  )%  |  (9  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  11  |  6  |  (45  |  )%   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (4  |  )  |  (8  |  )  |  (100  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **250** |  **(12** |  **)%** |  **(12** |  **)%**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount, NC fulfillment center (“Rocky Mount”) in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs. These items are included in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA. See Reconciling Schedule 2.   \n  \n**QxH**\n\nQxH revenue declined due to a 6% decrease in units shipped as well as lower shipping and handling revenue, partially offset by favorable returns. QxH reported declines in all categories. \n\nOperating income increased in the third quarter comparing against $19 million of one-time net restructuring costs and penalties incurred in the prior year period. \n\nAdjusted OIBDA margin(3) decreased due to fulfillment (warehouse and freight) pressure and sales deleverage, partially offset by higher product margins. Fulfillment pressure was driven by higher fulfillment center wages and freight rates and deleverage, partially offset by increased productivity efficiencies. Operating expenses decreased 6% due to lower commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% driven by lower personnel expense and outside services costs, partially offset by increased marketing costs due to brand marketing to support QVC’s Age of Possibility campaign. \n\n**QVC International**\n\nQVC International’s constant currency revenue decreased primarily due to a 3% decrease in average selling price, partially offset by a 1% increase in units shipped and favorable returns. QVC International reported constant currency growth in home and accessories, with a decline in apparel and beauty. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased primarily due to higher fulfillment costs and lower product margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Fulfillment costs increased due to higher freight rates and fulfillment center wages. Product margins decreased reflecting lower initial margin due to product mix and higher ocean freight rates, partially offset by favorable returns. \n\nUS Dollar denominated results were not materially impacted by exchange rate fluctuations. The Dollar weakened 3% against the British Pound, 1% against the Euro and strengthened 3% against the Japanese Yen. The financial metrics presented in this press release also provide a comparison of the percentage change in QVC International’s results in constant currency to the comparable figures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, where applicable. \n\n**Cornerstone**\n\nCornerstone revenue decreased, reflecting softness and competitive promotional pressure in the home sector. Cornerstone is implementing a transformation plan to improve its revenue and profitability given the continued challenges in the housing sector. Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased mainly due to higher costs for outside services related to its transformation plan and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower supply chain costs. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL METRICS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions unless otherwise noted)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**QxH**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  65.4  |  %  |  65.5  |  %  |  10  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)(b) |  5.6  |  %  |  7.0  |  %  |  140  |  bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)(b) |  12.4  |  %  |  12.0  |  %  |  (40  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  $  |  51.78  |  $  |  51.76  |  0  |  %   \nUnits Sold  |  (6  |  )%   \nReturn Rate(c) |  15.4  |  %  |  14.6  |  %  |  (80  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  996  |  $  |  967  |  (3  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  61.6  |  %  |  63.6  |  %  |  200  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.0  |  %  |  70.7  |  %  |  170  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  8.2  |  7.9  |  (4  |  )%   \n**QVC International**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  63.4  |  %  |  64.6  |  %  |  120  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  10.9  |  %  |  10.0  |  %  |  (90  |  )bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  13.3  |  %  |  12.3  |  %  |  (100  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  (3  |  )%  |  (3  |  )%   \nUnits Sold  |  1  |  %   \nReturn Rate(c) |  19.6  |  %  |  18.9  |  %  |  (70  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  283  |  $  |  297  |  5  |  %  |  5  |  %   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  49.0  |  %  |  52.0  |  %  |  300  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.3  |  %  |  76.1  |  %  |  680  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  4.2  |  4.0  |  (5  |  )%   \n**Cornerstone**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  62.8  |  %  |  59.9  |  %  |  (290  |  )bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  1.4  |  %  |  NM  |  NM   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  3.9  |  %  |  2.4  |  %  |  (150  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  218  |  $  |  188  |  (14  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  76.5  |  %  |  74.6  |  %  |  (190  |  )bps   \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of Rocky Mount in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

It is subject to mandatory redemption on March 15, 2031. The Preferred Stock is considered a liability for GAAP purposes, and is recorded net of capitalized costs.   \nd)  |  As defined in QVC’s credit agreement. A portion of expected cost savings are included in Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of the covenant calculations under QVC’s bank credit facility.   \n  \nCash at Qurate Retail decreased $337 million in the third quarter primarily due to net debt repayment and capital expenditures during the period. On September 26, 2024, QVC completed an offer in which 89% of its 4.75% senior secured notes due 2027 and 4.375% senior secured notes due 2028 were tendered. The transaction was funded by $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 and $352 million of cash. Total debt at Qurate Retail decreased $299 million in the third quarter due to the repurchase of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 senior secured notes, partially offset by the issuance of the new 2029 senior secured notes and additional net borrowing under QVC’s bank credit facility. \n\nQVC’s bank credit facility has $1.3 billion drawn as of September 30, 2024 with incremental availability of $1.8 billion, net of letters of credit. QVC’s leverage ratio, as defined by the QVC revolving credit facility, was 3.1x at quarter-end. Pursuant to the terms of QVC’s revolving credit facility, a portion of expected cost savings are included in operating income for purposes of QVC’s leverage ratio for covenant calculations. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, QVC’s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC’s senior secured notes) was greater than 3.5x and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments. Dividends made by QVC to service the principal and interest of indebtedness of its parent entities, as well as payments made by QVC to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries, are permitted under the bond indenture and credit agreement. \n\nQurate Retail is in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**Important Notice:** Qurate Retail, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) will discuss Qurate Retail’s earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 8:30 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024. The call can be accessed by dialing (877) 704-4234 or (215) 268-9904, passcode 13744091, at least 10 minutes prior to the start time. The call will also be broadcast live across the Internet and archived on our website. To access the webcast go to https://www.qurateretail.com/investors/news-events/ir-calendar. Links to this press release and replays of the call will also be available on Qurate Retail’s website. \n\n_This press release includes certain forward-looking statements, including statements about business strategies and initiatives (including Project Athens and Cornerstone’s transformation plan) and their expected benefits, market potential, future financial performance and prospects and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, possible changes in market acceptance of new products or services, competitive issues, regulatory matters affecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms acceptable to Qurate Retail, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of investment opportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of future public health crises), issues impacting the global supply chain and labor market and use of social media and influencers. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and Qurate Retail expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Qurate Retail's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Qurate Retail, including the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, for additional information about Qurate Retail and about the risks and uncertainties related to Qurate Retail's business which may affect the statements made in this press release._\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for Qurate Retail, QVC (and certain of its subsidiaries) and Cornerstone together with a reconciliation to that entity or such businesses’ operating income, as determined under GAAP. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified impairments, litigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire related costs, net (including Rocky Mount inventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale leaseback transactions. Further, this press release includes Adjusted OIBDA margin, which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as Adjusted OIBDA divided by revenue. \n\nQurate Retail believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’s performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Qurate Retail views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Qurate Retail's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. Please see the attached schedules for applicable reconciliations. \n\nThis press release also references certain financial metrics on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, for Qurate Retail. Constant currency financial metrics, as presented herein, are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. \n\nQurate Retail believes constant currency financial metrics are an important indicator of financial performance, in particular for QVC, due to the translational impact of foreign currency fluctuations relating to its subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Italy and Japan. We use constant currency financial metrics to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Please see the financial tables at the beginning of this press release for a reconciliation of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue, operating income, Adjusted OIBDA and average selling price. \n\nSCHEDULE 1 \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Qurate Retail’s Adjusted OIBDA to its operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively. \n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME AND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  4Q23  |  1Q24  |  2Q24  |  3Q24   \n**Qurate Retail Operating Income (Loss)** |  $  |  151  |  $  |  (103  |  )  |  $  |  145  |  $  |  165  |  $  |  152   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  105  |  98  |  99  |  96  |  95   \nStock compensation expense  |  10  |  13  |  16  |  3  |  3   \nRestructuring, penalty and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) (including Rocky Mount inventory losses)(a) |  19  |  —  |  —  |  18  |  —   \nImpairment of intangible assets(b) |  —  |  326  |  —  |  —  |  —   \n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and sale leaseback transactions(c) |  —  |  6  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  —   \n**Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **340** |  **$** |  **259** |  **$** |  **282** |  **$** |  **250**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount fulfillment center in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus\ndepreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified impairments,\nlitigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire related costs, net (including Rocky Mount\ninventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale leaseback transactions.\nQurate Retail believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its\nbusinesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’s performance or indicative of\nongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical\ncomparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted\nOIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Qurate Retail views operating income as the most directly\ncomparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP\nmeasure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that\nQurate Retail's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets.\nNon-GAAP Information – Schedule\nQurate Retail, Inc.\nReconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted OIBDA, USD Millions\nFY-22 FY-23 LTM Sept 2024 YTD 2024\nOperating Income (Loss) $ (2,041) $ 590 $ 359 $ 462\nDepreciation and amortization 481 407 388 290\nStock compensation expense 60 53 35 22\nRestructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) 3 (189) 18 18\nImpairment of intangible assets 3,081 326 326 -\n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and sale leaseback transactions (520) (113) 5 (1)\nAdjusted OIBDA $ 1,064 $ 1,074 $ 1,131 $ 791\nRevenue $ 12,106 $ 10,915 $ 10,236 $ 7,093\nAdjusted OIBDA margin 8.8% 9.8% 11.0% 11.2%"

(\"Qurate Retail\") (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) today reported third quarter 2024 results(1). \n\n“While the third quarter was anticipated to be the most difficult quarter of 2024, current headline events and the challenging macro-economic climate heavily impacted viewership of our programming and consumer behavior more than expected,” said David Rawlinson, President and CEO of Qurate Retail. “As a result, revenue underperformed this quarter and resulted in meaningful bottom-line deleverage. Despite this, we were able to hold consolidated gross margin flat with disciplined cost management and reduced operating expenses. We also continued our proactive balance sheet management, completing an offer in which 89% of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 notes were tendered which improves the QVC credit profile with reduced debt and an extended maturity profile. \n\n“We are nearing the end of our multi-year Project Athens initiative focused on margin and free cash flow. The team has materially improved the business, becoming a more profitable, leaner and more nimble organization. We are transitioning to the next phase of our strategic growth as we enhance our capabilities to reach aggregated audiences on primarily social and streaming platforms.” \n\nThird quarter 2024 headlines: \n\n  * Qurate Retail revenue decreased 5% in both US Dollars and constant currency(2)\n  * Generated $152 million in operating income \n  * Adjusted OIBDA(3) decreased 12% in both US Dollars and constant currency to $250 million \n  * QxH revenue decreased 6% \n  * QVC International revenue decreased 1% in both US Dollars and constant currency \n  * Cornerstone revenue decreased 12% \n  * Tendered 89% of QVC, Inc.’s 2027 and 2028 notes \n    * Partially funded with $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 \n    * Improves QVC credit position with reduced debt balance and extended maturity profile \n\n\n\nDiscussion of Results\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**Revenue**  \nQxH  |  $  |  1,617  |  $  |  1,521  |  (6  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  577  |  571  |  (1  |  )%  |  (1  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  285  |  252  |  (12  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Revenue** |  **2,479** |  **2,344** |  **(5** |  **)%** |  **(5** |  **)%**  \n**Operating Income (Loss)**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  91  |  $  |  107  |  18  |  %   \nQVC International  |  63  |  57  |  (10  |  )%  |  (8  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  4  |  (2  |  )  |  NM   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (7  |  )  |  (10  |  )  |  (43  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Operating Income** |  **151** |  **152** |  **1** |  **%** |  **1** |  **%**  \n**Adjusted OIBDA**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  201  |  $  |  182  |  (9  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  77  |  70  |  (9  |  )%  |  (9  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  11  |  6  |  (45  |  )%   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (4  |  )  |  (8  |  )  |  (100  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **250** |  **(12** |  **)%** |  **(12** |  **)%**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount, NC fulfillment center (“Rocky Mount”) in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs. These items are included in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA. See Reconciling Schedule 2.   \n  \n**QxH**\n\nQxH revenue declined due to a 6% decrease in units shipped as well as lower shipping and handling revenue, partially offset by favorable returns. QxH reported declines in all categories. \n\nOperating income increased in the third quarter comparing against $19 million of one-time net restructuring costs and penalties incurred in the prior year period. \n\nAdjusted OIBDA margin(3) decreased due to fulfillment (warehouse and freight) pressure and sales deleverage, partially offset by higher product margins. Fulfillment pressure was driven by higher fulfillment center wages and freight rates and deleverage, partially offset by increased productivity efficiencies. Operating expenses decreased 6% due to lower commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% driven by lower personnel expense and outside services costs, partially offset by increased marketing costs due to brand marketing to support QVC’s Age of Possibility campaign. \n\n**QVC International**\n\nQVC International’s constant currency revenue decreased primarily due to a 3% decrease in average selling price, partially offset by a 1% increase in units shipped and favorable returns. QVC International reported constant currency growth in home and accessories, with a decline in apparel and beauty. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased primarily due to higher fulfillment costs and lower product margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Fulfillment costs increased due to higher freight rates and fulfillment center wages. Product margins decreased reflecting lower initial margin due to product mix and higher ocean freight rates, partially offset by favorable returns. \n\nUS Dollar denominated results were not materially impacted by exchange rate fluctuations. The Dollar weakened 3% against the British Pound, 1% against the Euro and strengthened 3% against the Japanese Yen. The financial metrics presented in this press release also provide a comparison of the percentage change in QVC International’s results in constant currency to the comparable figures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, where applicable. \n\n**Cornerstone**\n\nCornerstone revenue decreased, reflecting softness and competitive promotional pressure in the home sector. Cornerstone is implementing a transformation plan to improve its revenue and profitability given the continued challenges in the housing sector. Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased mainly due to higher costs for outside services related to its transformation plan and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower supply chain costs. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL METRICS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions unless otherwise noted)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**QxH**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  65.4  |  %  |  65.5  |  %  |  10  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)(b) |  5.6  |  %  |  7.0  |  %  |  140  |  bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)(b) |  12.4  |  %  |  12.0  |  %  |  (40  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  $  |  51.78  |  $  |  51.76  |  0  |  %   \nUnits Sold  |  (6  |  )%   \nReturn Rate(c) |  15.4  |  %  |  14.6  |  %  |  (80  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  996  |  $  |  967  |  (3  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  61.6  |  %  |  63.6  |  %  |  200  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.0  |  %  |  70.7  |  %  |  170  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  8.2  |  7.9  |  (4  |  )%   \n**QVC International**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  63.4  |  %  |  64.6  |  %  |  120  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  10.9  |  %  |  10.0  |  %  |  (90  |  )bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  13.3  |  %  |  12.3  |  %  |  (100  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  (3  |  )%  |  (3  |  )%   \nUnits Sold  |  1  |  %   \nReturn Rate(c) |  19.6  |  %  |  18.9  |  %  |  (70  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  283  |  $  |  297  |  5  |  %  |  5  |  %   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  49.0  |  %  |  52.0  |  %  |  300  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.3  |  %  |  76.1  |  %  |  680  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  4.2  |  4.0  |  (5  |  )%   \n**Cornerstone**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  62.8  |  %  |  59.9  |  %  |  (290  |  )bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  1.4  |  %  |  NM  |  NM   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  3.9  |  %  |  2.4  |  %  |  (150  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  218  |  $  |  188  |  (14  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  76.5  |  %  |  74.6  |  %  |  (190  |  )bps   \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of Rocky Mount in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

The Preferred Stock is considered a liability for GAAP purposes, and is recorded net of capitalized costs.   \nd)  |  As defined in QVC’s credit agreement. A portion of expected cost savings are included in Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of the covenant calculations under QVC’s bank credit facility.   \n  \nCash at Qurate Retail decreased $337 million in the third quarter primarily due to net debt repayment and capital expenditures during the period. On September 26, 2024, QVC completed an offer in which 89% of its 4.75% senior secured notes due 2027 and 4.375% senior secured notes due 2028 were tendered. The transaction was funded by $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 and $352 million of cash. Total debt at Qurate Retail decreased $299 million in the third quarter due to the repurchase of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 senior secured notes, partially offset by the issuance of the new 2029 senior secured notes and additional net borrowing under QVC’s bank credit facility. \n\nQVC’s bank credit facility has $1.3 billion drawn as of September 30, 2024 with incremental availability of $1.8 billion, net of letters of credit. QVC’s leverage ratio, as defined by the QVC revolving credit facility, was 3.1x at quarter-end. Pursuant to the terms of QVC’s revolving credit facility, a portion of expected cost savings are included in operating income for purposes of QVC’s leverage ratio for covenant calculations. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, QVC’s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC’s senior secured notes) was greater than 3.5x and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments. Dividends made by QVC to service the principal and interest of indebtedness of its parent entities, as well as payments made by QVC to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries, are permitted under the bond indenture and credit agreement. \n\nQurate Retail is in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**Important Notice:** Qurate Retail, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) will discuss Qurate Retail’s earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 8:30 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024. The call can be accessed by dialing (877) 704-4234 or (215) 268-9904, passcode 13744091, at least 10 minutes prior to the start time.

These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, possible changes in market acceptance of new products or services, competitive issues, regulatory matters affecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms acceptable to Qurate Retail, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of investment opportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of future public health crises), issues impacting the global supply chain and labor market and use of social media and influencers. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and Qurate Retail expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Qurate Retail's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Qurate Retail, including the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, for additional information about Qurate Retail and about the risks and uncertainties related to Qurate Retail's business which may affect the statements made in this press release._\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for Qurate Retail, QVC (and certain of its subsidiaries) and Cornerstone together with a reconciliation to that entity or such businesses’ operating income, as determined under GAAP. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified impairments, litigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire related costs, net (including Rocky Mount inventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale leaseback transactions. Further, this press release includes Adjusted OIBDA margin, which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as Adjusted OIBDA divided by revenue. \n\nQurate Retail believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’s performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Qurate Retail views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Qurate Retail's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. Please see the attached schedules for applicable reconciliations. \n\nThis press release also references certain financial metrics on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, for Qurate Retail. Constant currency financial metrics, as presented herein, are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. \n\nQurate Retail believes constant currency financial metrics are an important indicator of financial performance, in particular for QVC, due to the translational impact of foreign currency fluctuations relating to its subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Italy and Japan. We use constant currency financial metrics to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Please see the financial tables at the beginning of this press release for a reconciliation of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue, operating income, Adjusted OIBDA and average selling price. \n\nSCHEDULE 1 \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Qurate Retail’s Adjusted OIBDA to its operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively. \n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME AND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  4Q23  |  1Q24  |  2Q24  |  3Q24   \n**Qurate Retail Operating Income (Loss)** |  $  |  151  |  $  |  (103  |  )  |  $  |  145  |  $  |  165  |  $  |  152   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  105  |  98  |  99  |  96  |  95   \nStock compensation expense  |  10  |  13  |  16  |  3  |  3   \nRestructuring, penalty and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) (including Rocky Mount inventory losses)(a) |  19  |  —  |  —  |  18  |  —   \nImpairment of intangible assets(b) |  —  |  326  |  —  |  —  |  —   \n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and sale leaseback transactions(c) |  —  |  6  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  —   \n**Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **340** |  **$** |  **259** |  **$** |  **282** |  **$** |  **250**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount fulfillment center in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs. In the second quarter of 2024, Qurate Retail incurred $18 million of restructuring charges related to a plan to shift its information technology operating model. These items are included in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA.   \nb)  |  In the fourth quarter of 2023, QxH recognized a $326 million non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill.   \nc)  |  Includes a loss related to the sale leaseback of a German property in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a gain related to the sale leaseback of a German property in the first quarter of 2024.

(\"Qurate Retail\") (Nasdaq:\nQRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) today reported third quarter 2024 results(1).\n“While the third quarter was anticipated to be the most difficult quarter of 2024, current\nheadline events and the challenging macro-economic climate heavily impacted viewership of\nour programming and consumer behavior more than expected,” said David Rawlinson,\nPresident and CEO of Qurate Retail. “As a result, revenue underperformed this quarter and\nresulted in meaningful bottom-line deleverage. Despite this, we were able to hold\nconsolidated gross margin flat with disciplined cost management and reduced operating\nexpenses. We also continued our proactive balance sheet management, completing an offer\nin which 89% of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 notes were tendered which improves the QVC credit\nprofile with reduced debt and an extended maturity profile.\n“We are nearing the end of our multi-year Project Athens initiative focused on margin and\nfree cash flow. The team has materially improved the business, becoming a more profitable,\nleaner and more nimble organization. We are transitioning to the next phase of our strategic\ngrowth as we enhance our capabilities to reach aggregated audiences on primarily social\nand streaming platforms.”\nThird quarter 2024 headlines:\nQurate Retail revenue decreased 5% in both US Dollars and constant currency(2)\nGenerated $152 million in operating income\nAdjusted OIBDA(3) decreased 12% in both US Dollars and constant currency to $250\nmillion\nQxH revenue decreased 6%\nQVC International revenue decreased 1% in both US Dollars and constant currency\nCornerstone revenue decreased 12%\nTendered 89% of QVC, Inc.’s 2027 and 2028 notes\nPartially funded with $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029\nImproves QVC credit position with reduced debt balance and extended maturity\nprofile\nDiscussion of Results\nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\n% Change\nConstant\n(amounts in millions) 3Q23 3Q24 % Change Currency(a)\nRevenue\nQxH $ 1,617 $ 1,521 (6)%\nQVC International 577 571 (1)% (1)%\nCornerstone 285 252 (12)%\nTotal Qurate Retail Revenue\n2,479 2,344 (5)%\n(5)%\nOperating Income (Loss)\nQxH(b) $ 91 $ 107 18%\nQVC International 63 57 (10)% (8)%\nCornerstone 4 (2) NM\nUnallocated corporate cost (7) (10) (43)%\nTotal Qurate Retail Operating\nIncome\n151 152 1%\n1%\nAdjusted OIBDA\nQxH(b) $ 201 $ 182 (9)%\nQVC International 77 70 (9)% (9)%\nCornerstone 11 6 (45)%\nUnallocated corporate cost (4) (8) (100)%\nTotal Qurate Retail Adjusted\nOIBDA $ 285 $ 250 (12)% (12)%\n________________________________________\na)For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.\nb)In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky\nMount, NC fulfillment center (“Rocky Mount”) in February 2023 on proceeds released from\nescrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs. These items are\nincluded in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA. See Reconciling\nSchedule 2.\nQxH\nQxH revenue declined due to a 6% decrease in units shipped as well as lower shipping and\nhandling revenue, partially offset by favorable returns. QxH reported declines in all\ncategories.\nOperating income increased in the third quarter comparing against $19 million of one-time\nnet restructuring costs and penalties incurred in the prior year period.\nAdjusted OIBDA margin(3) decreased due to fulfillment (warehouse and freight) pressure and\nsales deleverage, partially offset by higher product margins. Fulfillment pressure was driven\nby higher fulfillment center wages and freight rates and deleverage, partially offset by\nincreased productivity efficiencies. Operating expenses decreased 6% due to lower\ncommissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% driven by lower\npersonnel expense and outside services costs, partially offset by increased marketing costs\ndue to brand marketing to support QVC’s Age of Possibility campaign.\nQVC International\nQVC International’s constant currency revenue decreased primarily due to a 3% decrease in\naverage selling price, partially offset by a 1% increase in units shipped and favorable\nreturns. QVC International reported constant currency growth in home and accessories, with\na decline in apparel and beauty.\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased primarily due to higher fulfillment\ncosts and lower product margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Fulfillment\ncosts increased due to higher freight rates and fulfillment center wages. Product margins\ndecreased reflecting lower initial margin due to product mix and higher ocean freight rates,\npartially offset by favorable returns.\nUS Dollar denominated results were not materially impacted by exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe Dollar weakened 3% against the British Pound, 1% against the Euro and strengthened\n3% against the Japanese Yen. The financial metrics presented in this press release also\nprovide a comparison of the percentage change in QVC International’s results in constant\ncurrency to the comparable figures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, where\napplicable.\nCornerstone\nCornerstone revenue decreased, reflecting softness and competitive promotional pressure in\nthe home sector. Cornerstone is implementing a transformation plan to improve its revenue\nand profitability given the continued challenges in the housing sector. Operating income and\nAdjusted OIBDA margin decreased mainly due to higher costs for outside services related to\nits transformation plan and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower supply chain costs.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL METRICS\n% Change\n(amounts in millions unless Constant\notherwise noted) 3Q23 3Q24 % Change Currency(a)\nQxH\nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue 65.4% 65.5% 10bps\nOperating Income Margin (%)(b) 5.6% 7.0% 140bps\nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)(b)\n12.4% 12.0% (40)bps\nAverage Selling Price $ 51.78 $ 51.76 0%\nUnits Sold (6)%\nReturn Rate(c) 15.4% 14.6% (80)bps\neCommerce Revenue(d) $ 996 $ 967 (3)%\neCommerce % of Total Revenue 61.6% 63.6% 200bps\nMobile % of eCommerce\nRevenue(e) 69.0% 70.7% 170bps\nLTM Total Customers(f) 8.2 7.9 (4)%\nQVC International\nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue 63.4% 64.6% 120bps\nOperating Income Margin (%) 10.9% 10.0% (90)bps\nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%) 13.3% 12.3% (100)bps\nAverage Selling Price (3)% (3)%\nUnits Sold 1%\nReturn Rate(c) 19.6% 18.9% (70)bps\neCommerce Revenue(d) $ 283 $ 297 5% 5%\neCommerce % of Total Revenue 49.0% 52.0% 300bps\nMobile % of eCommerce\nRevenue(e) 69.3% 76.1% 680bps\nLTM Total Customers(f) 4.2 4.0 (5)%\nCornerstone\nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue 62.8% 59.9% (290)bps\nOperating Income Margin (%) 1.4% NM NM\nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%) 3.9% 2.4% (150)bps\neCommerce Revenue(d) $ 218 $ 188 (14)%\neCommerce % of Total Revenue 76.5% 74.6% (190)bps\n________________________________________\na)For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.\nb)In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of Rocky Mount\nin February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring,\npenalty and fire-related costs.

It is subject to mandatory redemption on\nMarch 15, 2031. The Preferred Stock is considered a liability for GAAP purposes, and is\nrecorded net of capitalized costs.\nd)As defined in QVC’s credit agreement. A portion of expected cost savings are included in\nAdjusted EBITDA for purposes of the covenant calculations under QVC’s bank credit\nfacility.\nCash at Qurate Retail decreased $337 million in the third quarter primarily due to net debt\nrepayment and capital expenditures during the period. On September 26, 2024, QVC\ncompleted an offer in which 89% of its 4.75% senior secured notes due 2027 and 4.375%\nsenior secured notes due 2028 were tendered. The transaction was funded by $605 million\nof new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 and $352 million of cash. Total debt at\nQurate Retail decreased $299 million in the third quarter due to the repurchase of QVC’s\n2027 and 2028 senior secured notes, partially offset by the issuance of the new 2029 senior\nsecured notes and additional net borrowing under QVC’s bank credit facility.\nQVC’s bank credit facility has $1.3 billion drawn as of September 30, 2024 with incremental\navailability of $1.8 billion, net of letters of credit. QVC’s leverage ratio, as defined by the\nQVC revolving credit facility, was 3.1x at quarter-end. Pursuant to the terms of QVC’s\nrevolving credit facility, a portion of expected cost savings are included in operating income\nfor purposes of QVC’s leverage ratio for covenant calculations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, QVC’s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC’s\nsenior secured notes) was greater than 3.5x and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to\nmake unlimited dividends or other restricted payments. Dividends made by QVC to service\nthe principal and interest of indebtedness of its parent entities, as well as payments made by\nQVC to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax\nobligations of QVC and its subsidiaries, are permitted under the bond indenture and credit\nagreement.\nQurate Retail is in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nImportant Notice: Qurate Retail, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) will discuss\nQurate Retail’s earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 8:30 a.m. (E.T.) on\nNovember 7, 2024. The call can be accessed by dialing (877) 704-4234 or (215) 268-9904,\npasscode 13744091, at least 10 minutes prior to the start time. The call will also be\nbroadcast live across the Internet and archived on our website. To access the webcast go to\nhttps://www.qurateretail.com/investors/news-events/ir-calendar. Links to this press release\nand replays of the call will also be available on Qurate Retail’s website.\nThis press release includes certain forward-looking statements, including statements about\nbusiness strategies and initiatives (including Project Athens and Cornerstone’s\ntransformation plan) and their expected benefits, market potential, future financial\nperformance and prospects and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-\nlooking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without\nlimitation, possible changes in market acceptance of new products or services, competitive\nissues, regulatory matters affecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms\nacceptable to Qurate Retail, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of\ninvestment opportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of future public\nhealth crises), issues impacting the global supply chain and labor market and use of social\nmedia and influencers. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this\npress release, and Qurate Retail expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to\ndisseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to\nreflect any change in Qurate Retail's expectations with regard thereto or any change in\nevents, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to\nthe publicly filed documents of Qurate Retail, including the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-\nQ, for additional information about Qurate Retail and about the risks and uncertainties\nrelated to Qurate Retail's business which may affect the statements made in this press\nrelease.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press\nrelease includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure,\nfor Qurate Retail, QVC (and certain of its subsidiaries) and Cornerstone together with a\nreconciliation to that entity or such businesses’ operating income, as determined under\nGAAP. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation\nand amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified\nimpairments, litigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire\nrelated costs, net (including Rocky Mount inventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale\nleaseback transactions. Further, this press release includes Adjusted OIBDA margin, which\nis also a non-GAAP financial measure. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as\nAdjusted OIBDA divided by revenue.\nQurate Retail believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength\nand performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection\nof each business’s performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this\nmeasure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons\nand benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance.\nBecause Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Qurate Retail\nviews operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is\nnot meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather\nto supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information\nthat Qurate Retail's management considers in assessing the results of operations and\nperformance of its assets. Please see the attached schedules for applicable reconciliations.\nThis press release also references certain financial metrics on a constant currency basis,\nwhich is a non-GAAP measure, for Qurate Retail. Constant currency financial metrics, as\npresented herein, are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported\namounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency.\nQurate Retail believes constant currency financial metrics are an important indicator of\nfinancial performance, in particular for QVC, due to the translational impact of foreign\ncurrency fluctuations relating to its subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Italy and Japan. We use\nconstant currency financial metrics to provide a framework to assess how our businesses\nperformed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Please see the\nfinancial tables at the beginning of this press release for a reconciliation of the impact of\nforeign currency fluctuations on revenue, operating income, Adjusted OIBDA and average\nselling price.\nSCHEDULE 1\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Qurate Retail’s Adjusted OIBDA to its\noperating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September\n30, 2024, respectively.\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME AND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION\n(amounts in millions) 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24\nQurate Retail Operating Income\n(Loss) $ 151 $ (103) $ 145 $ 165 $ 152\nDepreciation and amortization 105 98 99 96 95\nStock compensation expense 10 13 16 3 3\nRestructuring, penalty and fire related\ncosts, net of (recoveries) (including\nRocky Mount inventory losses)(a) 19 — — 18 —\nImpairment of intangible assets(b) — 326 — — —\n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and\nsale leaseback transactions(c) — 6 (1) — —\nQurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA $ 285 $ 340 $ 259 $ 282 $ 250\n________________________________________\na)In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky\nMount fulfillment center in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21\nmillion of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\n(1) Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Qurate Retail, Inc. and its controlled\nsubsidiaries (collectively, \"Qurate Retail,\" the \"Company,\" “Consolidated Qurate Retail,” “us,” “we,” or “our” unless the context otherwise\nrequires). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Qurate Retail is made up of\nwholly-owned subsidiaries QVC, Inc. (“QVC”), which includes HSN, Inc. (“HSN”), Cornerstone Brands, Inc. (“CBI”), and other cost\nmethod investments.\nQurate Retail is primarily engaged in the video and online commerce industries in North America, Europe and Asia. The businesses of\nthe Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, QVC and CBI, are seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in the fourth calendar quarter\nrelated to year-end holiday shopping.\nThe accompanying (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial\nstatements, and (b) the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of\nRegulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and\nfootnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal\nrecurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods have been included. Additionally, certain prior\nperiod amounts have been reclassified for comparability with current period presentation. These condensed consolidated financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Qurate Retail's Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 10-K”).\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Qurate Retail considers (i) fair value measurements,\n(ii) accounting for income taxes, and (iii) estimates of retail-related adjustments and allowances to be its most significant estimates.\nQurate Retail has entered into certain agreements with Liberty Media Corporation (\"LMC\"), a separate publicly traded company.\nThese agreements include a reorganization agreement, services agreement and facilities sharing agreement. As a result of certain corporate\ntransactions, LMC and Qurate Retail may have obligations to each other for certain tax related matters. Neither Qurate Retail nor LMC has\nany stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. In connection with a split-off transaction that occurred in the first quarter of 2018\n(the “GCI Liberty Split-Off”), Qurate Retail and GCI Liberty, Inc. (“GCI Liberty”) entered into a tax sharing agreement. Pursuant to the tax\nsharing agreement, GCI Liberty agreed to indemnify Qurate Retail for taxes and tax-related losses resulting from the GCI Liberty Split-Off\nto the extent such taxes or tax-related losses (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain restrictive\ncovenants made by GCI Liberty (applicable to actions or failures to act by GCI Liberty and its subsidiaries following the completion of the\nGCI Liberty Split-Off), or (ii) result from Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code applying to the GCI Liberty Split-Off as a result of\nthe GCI Liberty Split-Off being part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or\nindirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of GCI Liberty (or any successor corporation).\nFollowing a merger between Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”) and GCI Liberty, Liberty Broadband has assumed the\ntax sharing agreement.\nIn December 2019, the Company entered into an amended services agreement. Under the amended services agreement, components of\nLMC’s Chief Executive Officer’s compensation are either paid directly to him or reimbursed to LMC, in each case, based on allocations set\nforth in the amended services agreement, currently set at 10% for the Company but subject to adjustment on an annual basis and upon the\noccurrence of certain events.\nThe reorganization agreement with LMC provides for, among other things, provisions governing the relationship between Qurate\nRetail and LMC, including certain cross-indemnities. Pursuant to the services agreement, LMC provides\nI-10\nTable of Contents\nQURATE RETAIL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nQurate Retail with certain general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology,\ncybersecurity and investor relations support. Qurate Retail reimburses LMC for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by LMC in\nproviding these services and for Qurate Retail's allocable portion of costs associated with any shared services or personnel based on an\nestimated percentage of time spent providing services to Qurate Retail. Under the facilities sharing agreement, LMC shares office space and\nrelated amenities at its corporate headquarters with Qurate Retail. Under these various agreements, approximately $3 million and $2 million\nwas reimbursable to LMC for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $8 million and $6 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Qurate Retail had a tax sharing payable to Liberty Broadband in the amount\nof approximately $20 million and $16 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, included in other liabilities\nin the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nZulily, LLC (“Zulily”) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail until its divestiture on May 24, 2023. Qurate Retail recognized\na loss on the divestiture of $64 million in the second quarter of 2023. Zulily is included in Corporate and other through May 23, 2023 and\nis not presented as a discontinued operation as the disposition did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on Qurate Retail’s\noperations and financial results.\nIncluded in revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations is $301 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, related to Zulily. Included in net earnings (loss) in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations\nare losses of $44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to Zulily.\n(2) Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has granted to certain of its directors, employees and employees of its subsidiaries, restricted stock (“RSAs”), restricted\nstock units (“RSUs”) and options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock (collectively, \"Awards\"). The Company measures the\ncost of employee services received in exchange for an equity classified Award (such as stock options and RSAs) based on the grant-date fair\nvalue (“GDFV”) of the Award, and recognizes that cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service (usually\nthe vesting period of the Award). The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for a liability classified Award\nbased on the current fair value of the Award, and remeasures the fair value of the Award at each reporting date.\nIncluded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations are $3\nmillion and $10 million of stock-based compensation during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $22\nmillion and $40 million of stock-based compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nQurate Retail—RSUs\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and in connection with their employment agreements, Qurate Retail granted 3.7\nmillion performance-based, stock-settled RSUs of Series A Qurate Retail common stock (“QRTEA”) to our President and Chief Executive\nOfficer and 296 thousand performance-based, stock-settled RSUs of Series B Qurate Retail common stock (“QRTEB”) to our Chairman of\nthe Board. Such RSUs had a GDFV of $1.23 per share and $5.01 per share, respectively, and vest one year from the month of grant, subject\nto the satisfaction of certain performance objectives.\nI-11\nTable of Contents\nQURATE RETAIL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following table presents the number of cash-settled RSUs granted by the Company during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024:\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nRSUs Granted (000's)\nQRTEA time-based RSUs, subsidiary employees (1) 21,171\nQRTEA performance-based RSUs, subsidiary employees (2) 20,409\nQRTEA performance-based RSUs, Qurate Retail employees (3) 941\n(1) Grants mainly vest equally over three years.\n(2) Grants mainly vest equally over three years, subject to the satisfaction of certain performance objectives.\n(3) Grants mainly vest one year from the month of grant, subject to the satisfaction of certain performance objectives.\nFor cash-settled RSUs, the liability and compensation expense related to such awards is adjusted at the end of each reporting period\nbased on the closing market price of QRTEA on the last trading day of the quarter.\nFor awards that are performance-based, performance objectives, which are subjective, are considered in determining the timing and\namount of compensation expense recognized. When the satisfaction of the performance objectives becomes probable, the Company records\ncompensation expense. The probability of satisfying the performance objectives is assessed at the end of each reporting period.\nQurate Retail—Outstanding Awards\nThe following tables present the number and weighted average exercise price (\"WAEP\") of the options to purchase Qurate Retail\ncommon stock granted to certain officers, employees and directors of the Company, as well as the weighted average remaining life and\naggregate intrinsic value of the options.\nWeighted Aggregate\naverage intrinsic\nSeries A remaining value\n(000's) WAEP life (millions)\nOptions outstanding at January 1, 2024 23,530 $ 7.72\nGranted — $ —\nExercised — $ —\nForfeited/Cancelled (3,580) $ 10.24\nOptions outstanding at September 30, 2024 19,950 $ 7.27 2.0years $ —\nOptions exercisable at September 30, 2024 17,755 $ 7.11 1.9years $ —\nWeighted Aggregate\naverage intrinsic\nSeries B remaining value\n(000's) WAEP life (millions)\nOptions outstanding at January 1, 2024 723 $ 12.35\nGranted — $ —\nExercised — $ —\nForfeited/Cancelled (316) $ 11.59\nOptions outstanding at September 30, 2024 407 $ 12.95 0.5years $ —\nOptions exercisable at September 30, 2024 407 $ 12.95 0.5years $ —\nI-12\nTable of Contents\nQURATE RETAIL, INC.

Such\namount will be recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9\nyears.\nAs of September 30, 2024, Qurate Retail reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options approximately 20.0 million\nshares of QRTEA and 0.4 million shares of QRTEB.\n(3) Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share (\"EPS\") is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding (\"WASO\") for the period. Diluted EPS presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common\nshares as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented. Potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted EPS during periods in which losses are reported since the result would be antidilutive.\nExcluded from diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are 20 million and 25 million potential common\nshares, respectively, because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Excluded from diluted EPS for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 are 21 million and 27 million potential common shares, respectively, because their inclusion would have\nbeen antidilutive.\nQurate Retail Common Stock\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nnumber of shares in millions\nBasic WASO 396 388 399 386\nPotentially dilutive shares 1 1 1 1\nDiluted WASO 397 389 400 387\n(4) Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nFor assets and liabilities required to be reported at fair value, GAAP provides a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets\nor liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2\nI-13\nTable of Contents\nQURATE RETAIL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\ninputs are inputs, other than quoted market prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value are as follows:\nFair Value Measurements at Fair Value Measurements at\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nQuoted Quoted\nprices prices\nin active Significant in active Significant\nmarkets for other markets for other\nidentical observable identical observable\nassets inputs assets inputs\nDescription Total (Level 1) (Level 2) Total (Level 1) (Level 2)\namounts in millions\nCash equivalents $ 666 666 — 726 726 —\nDebt $ 289 — 289 219 — 219\nThe majority of the Company's Level 2 financial assets and liabilities are primarily debt instruments and derivative instruments with\nquoted market prices that are not considered to be traded on \"active markets,\" as defined in GAAP. The fair values for such instruments are\nderived from a typical model using observable market data as the significant inputs.\nRealized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments are comprised of changes in the fair value of the following:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in millions\nEquity securities (17) (2) (19) (19)\nExchangeable senior debentures (19) (24) (34) (37)\nOther financial instruments — 12 — (4)\n$ (36) (14) (53) (60)\nThe Company has elected to account for its exchangeable debt using the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of the\nexchangeable senior debentures recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations are primarily due to market factors\nprimarily driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying shares into which the debt is exchangeable. The Company isolates the\nportion of the unrealized gain (loss) attributable to the change in the instrument specific credit risk and recognizes such amount in other\ncomprehensive earnings (loss). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized less than $1 million\nand $45 million, respectively, of previously unrecognized gains, which was recognized through realized and unrealized gains (losses) on\nfinancial instruments, net on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The change in the fair value of the exchangeable senior\ndebentures attributable to changes in the instrument specific credit risk was a gain of less than $1 million and a gain of $1 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a loss of $38 million and a gain of $108 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, QVC’s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC’s senior secured notes)\nwas greater than 3.5 to 1.0 and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make dividends or other restricted payments under the senior\nsecured notes. Although QVC will not be able to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments under the senior secured notes\nleverage basket, QVC will continue to be permitted to make unlimited dividends to parent entities of QVC to service the principal and\ninterest when due in respect of indebtedness of such parent entities (so long as there is no default under the indentures governing QVC’s\nsenior secured notes) and permitted to make certain restricted payments to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in\nrespect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries.\nQVC Senior Secured Credit Facility\nOn October 27, 2021, QVC amended and restated its latest credit agreement (as amended and restated, the “Fifth Amended and\nRestated Credit Agreement”) and refinanced QVC’s existing bank credit facility by entering into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit\nAgreement with Zulily, CBI, and QVC Global Corporate Holdings, LLC (“QVC Global”), each a direct or indirect (or former, in the case of\nZulily) wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail, as borrowers (QVC, Zulily, CBI and QVC Global, collectively, the “Borrowers”),\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other parties named therein. In connection with the Zulily divestiture (see\nnote 1), Zulily is no longer a co-borrower in the Credit Facility, and Zulily repaid its outstanding borrowings under the Fifth Amended and\nRestated Credit Agreement using cash contributed from Qurate Retail, which was approximately $80 million.\nThe Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is a multi-currency facility providing for a $3.25 billion revolving credit facility\n(the “Credit Facility”), with a $450 million sub-limit for letters of credit and an alternative currency revolving sub-limit equal to 50% of the\nrevolving commitments thereunder. The Credit Facility may be borrowed by any Borrower, with each Borrower jointly and severally liable\nfor the outstanding borrowings. Borrowings under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at either the alternate\nbase rate (such rate, the “ABR Rate”) or a London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)-based rate (or the applicable non-U.S. Dollar\nequivalent rate) (such rate, the “Term Benchmark/RFR Rate”) at the applicable Borrower’s election in each case plus a margin. Borrowings\nthat are ABR Rate loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the base rate plus a margin that varies between 0.25% and 0.625%\ndepending on the Borrowers’ combined ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (the “consolidated leverage ratio”).\nBorrowings that are Term Benchmark/RFR Rate loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable rate plus a margin that\nvaries between 1.25% and 1.625% depending on the Borrowers’ consolidated leverage ratio. Each loan may be prepaid at any time and\nfrom time to time without penalty, other than customary breakage costs. No mandatory prepayments will be required other than when\nborrowings and letter of credit usage exceed availability; provided that, if CBI, QVC Global or any other borrower under the Credit Facility\n(other than QVC) is removed, at the election of QVC, as a borrower thereunder, all of its loans must be repaid and its letters of credit are\nterminated or cash collateralized. Any amounts prepaid on the Credit Facility may be reborrowed.\nOn June 20, 2023, QVC, QVC Global and CBI, as borrowers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other\nparties thereto entered into an agreement whereby, in accordance with the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, LIBOR-based\nrate loans denominated in U.S. dollars made on or after June 30, 2023 would be replaced with SOFR-based rate loans. Borrowings that are\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)-based loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate, plus a\ncredit spread adjustment, plus a margin that varies between 1.25% and 1.625% depending on the Borrowers’ consolidated leverage ratio.\nThe loans under the Credit Facility are scheduled to mature on October 27, 2026. Payment of the loans may be accelerated following\ncertain customary events of default.\nI-17\nTable of Contents\nQURATE RETAIL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe payment and performance of the Borrowers’ obligations under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed\nby each of QVC’s, QVC Global’s, and CBI’s Material Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit\nAgreement), if any, and certain other subsidiaries of any Borrower that such Borrower has chosen to provide guarantees. Further, the\nborrowings under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured, pari passu with QVC’s existing notes, by a pledge of all\nof QVC’s equity interests. The borrowings under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are also secured by a pledge of all of\nCBI’s equity interests.\nThe Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain restrictions\non the Borrowers and each of their respective restricted subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) with respect to, among other things:\nincurring additional indebtedness; creating liens on property or assets; making certain loans or investments; selling or disposing of assets;\npaying certain dividends and other restricted payments; dissolving, consolidating or merging; entering into certain transactions with\naffiliates; entering into sale or leaseback transactions; restricting subsidiary distributions; and limiting the Borrowers’ consolidated leverage\nratio.\nBorrowings under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be used to repay outstanding indebtedness, pay certain fees\nand expenses, finance working capital needs and general purposes of the Borrowers and their respective subsidiaries and make certain\nrestricted payments and loans to the Borrowers’ respective parents and affiliates.\nAvailability under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024 was $1,753 million. The interest rate on\nthe Credit Facility was 6.5% and 6.8% at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nExchangeable Senior Debentures\nThe Company has elected to account for its exchangeable senior debentures using the fair value option. Accordingly, changes in the\nfair value of these instruments are recognized as unrealized gains (losses) in the statements of operations. See note 4 for information related\nto unrealized gains (losses) on debt measured at fair value. As of September 30, 2024 the Company’s 3.75% and 4.0% Exchangeable\nDebentures have been classified as current because the Company does not own shares to exchange the debentures. The Company reviews\nthe terms of the debentures on a quarterly basis to determine whether a triggering event has occurred to require current classification of the\nexchangeables upon a call event.\nFair Value of Debt\nQurate Retail estimates the fair value of its debt based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rate\noffered to Qurate Retail for debt of the same remaining maturities (Level 2). The QVC 6.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2067 (“2067\nNotes”) and the QVC 6.25% Senior Secured Notes Due 2068 (“2068 Notes”) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and the\nCompany considers them to be actively traded. As such, the 2067 Notes and 2068 Notes are valued based on their trading price (Level 1).\nThe fair value of Qurate Retail's publicly traded debt securities that are not reported at fair value in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 are as follows (amounts in millions):\nSenior debentures $ 425\nQVC senior secured notes $ 2,008\nDue to the variable rate nature, Qurate Retail believes that the carrying amount of its other debt, not discussed above, approximated\nfair value at September 30, 2024.\n(7) Preferred Stock\nOn September 14, 2020, Qurate Retail issued its 8.0% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share\n(the “Preferred Stock”). There were 13,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock authorized and 12,723,282 shares of Preferred Stock issued\nand outstanding at September 30, 2024.\nI-18\nTable of Contents\nQURATE RETAIL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nPriority. The Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of Qurate Retail common stock, with respect to dividend rights, rights of\nredemption and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Qurate Retail’s\naffairs. Shares of Preferred Stock are not convertible into shares of Qurate Retail common stock.\nDividends. Holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive quarterly cash dividends at a rate of 8.0% per annum of the\nliquidation price (as described below) on a cumulative basis, during the term. If declared, accrued dividends will be payable quarterly on\neach dividend payment date, beginning December 15, 2020 and thereafter on each March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15\nduring the term (or, if such date is not a business day, the next business day after such date). If Qurate Retail fails to pay dividends or the\napplicable redemption price with respect to any redemption within 30 days after the applicable dividend payment or redemption date, the\ndividend rate will increase as provided by the Certificate of Designations for the Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designations”).\nAccrued dividends that are not paid within 30 days after the applicable dividend payment date will be added to the liquidation price until\npaid together with all dividends accrued thereon.\nThe ability of Qurate Retail to declare or pay any dividend on, or purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire, any of its common stock\nor any other stock ranking on parity with the Preferred Stock will be subject to restrictions if Qurate Retail does not pay all dividends and\nall redemption payments on the Preferred Stock, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the Certificate of Designations.\nDistributions upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon Qurate Retail’s liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, each\nholder of shares of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, before any distribution is made to the holders of Qurate Retail common\nstock, an amount equal to the liquidation price plus all unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) accrued from the immediately preceding\ndividend payment date, subject to the prior payment of liabilities owed to Qurate Retail’s creditors and the preferential amounts to which\nany stock senior to the Preferred Stock is entitled. The Preferred Stock has a liquidation price equal to the sum of (i) $100, plus (ii) all\naccrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) that have been added to the liquidation price.\nMandatory and Optional Redemption. The Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption on March 15, 2031 at the\nliquidation price plus all unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) accrued from the most recent dividend payment date. On or after the\nfifth anniversary of September 14, 2020 (the “Original Issue Date”), Qurate Retail may redeem all or a portion of the outstanding shares of\nPreferred Stock, at the liquidation price plus all unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) accrued from the most recent dividend payment\ndate plus, if the redemption is (x) on or after the fifth anniversary of the Original Issue Date but prior to its sixth anniversary, 4.00% of the\nliquidation price, (y) on or after the sixth anniversary of the Original Issue Date but prior to its seventh anniversary, 2.00% of the\nliquidation price and (z) on or after the seventh anniversary of the Original Issue Date, zero. Both mandatory and optional redemptions\nmust be paid in cash.\nVoting Power. Holders of the Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights or powers, except as specified in the Certificate of\nDesignations or as required by Delaware law.\nPreferred Stock Directors. So long as the aggregate liquidation price of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock exceeds 25% of\nthe aggregate liquidation price of the shares of Preferred Stock issued on the Original Issue Date, holders of Preferred Stock will have\ncertain director election rights as described in the Certificate of Designations whenever dividends on shares of Preferred Stock have not\nbeen declared and paid for two consecutive dividend periods and whenever Qurate Retail fails to pay the applicable redemption price in full\nwith respect to any redemption of the Preferred Stock or fails to make a payment with respect to the Preferred Stock in connection with a\nliquidation or Extraordinary Transactions (as defined in the Certificate of Designations).\nRecognition. As the Preferred Stock is subject to unconditional mandatory redemption in cash and was issued in the form of a\nshare, the Company concluded the Preferred Stock was a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument and should be classified as a liability\nin the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Preferred Stock was initially recorded at its fair value, which was determined to be the\nliquidation preference of $100 per share, and continues to be recorded at\nI-19\nTable of Contents\nQURATE RETAIL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nthis value until the settlement date. Given the liability classification of the Preferred Stock, all dividends accrued will be classified as\ninterest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Preferred Stock (level 1) was $553 million as\nof September 30, 2024.\n(8) Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nThe Company has contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Although it is reasonably possible Qurate Retail may incur losses upon conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any loss or\nrange of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, which may be required to satisfy such\ncontingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nFire at Rocky Mount Fulfillment Center\nOn December 18, 2021, QVC experienced a fire at its Rocky Mount fulfillment center in North Carolina. Rocky Mount was QVC’s\nsecond-largest fulfillment center for the operating segment comprised of QVC U.S. and HSN (“QxH”) and QVC’s primary returns center\nfor hard goods. QVC maintains property, general liability and business interruption insurance coverage.\nIn June 2023, QVC agreed to a final insurance settlement with its insurance company and received all remaining proceeds related to\nthe Rocky Mount claim. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, QVC received $280 million of insurance proceeds, of which\n$210 million represented recoveries for business interruption losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, QVC\nrecorded $5 million and $32 million of fire related costs, respectively, and recognized net losses of $5 million and net gains of $208\nmillion, respectively, representing proceeds received in excess of recoverable losses, in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of\n(recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nIn February 2023, QVC sold the Rocky Mount fulfillment center to an independent third party and received cash proceeds of $2\nmillion and $19 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. QVC recognized gains on the sale of $2\nmillion and $17 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, calculated as the difference between the\naggregate consideration received and the carrying value of the property. The gain is included in restructuring, penalties and fire related\ncosts, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nQVC Restructuring\nOn June 27, 2022, Qurate Retail announced a five-point turnaround plan designed to stabilize and differentiate its core QVC U.S. and\nHSN brands and expand the Company's leadership in video streaming commerce (“Project Athens”). Project Athens main initiatives\ninclude: (i) improve customer experience and grow relationships; (ii) rigorously execute core processes; (iii) lower cost to serve; (iv)\noptimize the brand portfolio; and (v) build new high growth businesses.\nDuring 2022, QVC commenced the first phase of Project Athens including actions to reduce inventory and a planned workforce\nreduction that was completed in February 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, QVC recorded restructuring charges\nof $13 million. These initiatives are consistent with QVC’s strategy to operate more efficiently as it implements its turnaround plan.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, QVC entered into an agreement and announced a plan to shift its global operating model for\ninformation technology services to a managed services model. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 QVC\nrecorded restructuring charges of $18 million in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations.\nI-20\nTable of Contents\nQURATE RETAIL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nZulily Restructuring\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Zulily began to execute a series of transformation initiatives, beginning with the announcement of the\nclosure of its fulfillment center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and reduction in corporate workforce. These initiatives were consistent with\nZulily’s strategy to operate more efficiently as it implemented its turnaround plan. Zulily recorded $5 million of restructuring charges\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to its reduction in corporate workforce. See note 1 for a discussion regarding the\nCompany’s divestiture of Zulily on May 24, 2023.\nGains on sale- leaseback transactions\nIn November 2022, QVC International entered into agreements to sell two properties located in Germany and the United Kingdom\n(“U.K.”) to an independent third party. Under the terms of the agreements, QVC received net cash proceeds of $102 million related to its\nGerman facility and $80 million related to its U.K. facility when the sale closed in January 2023. Concurrent with the sale, the Company\nentered into agreements to lease each of the properties back from the purchaser over an initial term of 20 years with the option to extend the\nterms of the property leases for up to four consecutive terms of five years. QVC recorded a gain of $69 million and $44 million related to\nthe successful sale-leaseback of the German and U.K. properties, respectively, during the first quarter of 2023 calculated as the difference\nbetween the aggregate consideration received and the carrying value of the properties. QVC accounted for the leases as operating at the\nclose of the sale-leaseback transaction, leases and recorded a $42 million and $32 million right-of-use asset and operating lease liability for\nthe German and U.K. properties, respectively.\nIn December 2023, QVC entered into an agreement to sell an owned and operated property in Germany to an independent third party.\nThis property was owned and considered held for sale as of December 31, 2023, and is included in other assets, at cost, net of accumulated\namortization in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Under the terms of the agreement, QVC received net cash proceeds of $6 million\nrelated to its German facility when the sale closed in February 2024. QVC recognized a $1 million gain related to the sale during the first\nquarter of 2024, calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration received and the carrying value of the property.\nConcurrent with the sale, QVC entered into an agreement to lease a portion of the property back over two years and recorded an operating\nlease right-of-use asset and operating lease liability of $1 million.\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $167 million\nto mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with the sale and leaseback of the Germany and U.K. properties. The forwards did not\nqualify as cash flow hedges under GAAP. Changes in the fair value of the forwards are reflected in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on\nfinancial instruments, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The contracts expired in January 2023 which resulted in a\nnet cash settlement of $12 million.\nOther\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, QVC recorded a $16 million provision for an unresolved matter\nbetween HSN and the Consumer Product Safety Commission concerning the imposition of civil penalties for allegedly failing to timely\nsubmit a report under the Consumer Product Safety Act in relation to handheld clothing steamers sold by HSN under the Joy Mangano\nbrand names My Little Steamer® and My Little Steamer® Go Mini that were subject to a voluntary recall previously announced on May\n26, 2021. The civil penalty was recorded in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations.\n(\nI-21\nTable of Contents\nQURATE RETAIL, INC.

Qurate Retail identifies its reportable segments as (A) those operating segments that represent 10% or more of its\nconsolidated annual revenue, annual Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below) or total assets and (B) those equity method affiliates whose share\nof earnings represent 10% or more of Qurate Retail's annual pre-tax earnings.\nThe Qurate Retail chief operating decision maker primarily evaluates performance and makes decisions about allocating resources to\nits operating segments based on financial measures such as revenue and Adjusted OIBDA. In addition, Qurate Retail reviews nonfinancial\nmeasures such as unique website visitors, number of units shipped, conversion rates and active customers, as appropriate.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Qurate Retail has identified the following operating segments as its reportable\nsegments:\n● QxH – QVC U.S. and HSN market and sell a wide variety of consumer products in the U.S., primarily by means of their\ntelevised shopping programs and via the Internet through their websites and mobile applications.\n● QVC International – QVC International markets and sells a wide variety of consumer products in several foreign countries,\nprimarily by means of its televised shopping programs and via the Internet through its international websites and mobile\napplications.\n● CBI – CBI consists of a portfolio of aspirational home and apparel brands in the U.S. that sell merchandise through brick-and-\nmortar retail locations as well as via the Internet through their websites.\nQurate Retail's operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services.

Qurate Retail believes this measure is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its\nbusinesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business\ntrends.

Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023 (the “2023 10-K”). These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to\nany forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in\nevents, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This\ndiscussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the\n2023 10-K.\nThe information herein relates to Qurate Retail, Inc. and its controlled subsidiaries (collectively “Qurate Retail,” the “Company,”\n“Consolidated Qurate Retail,” “us,” “we” or “our” unless the context otherwise requires).\nOverview\nWe own controlling interests in video and online commerce companies. Our largest businesses and reportable segments are our\noperating segment comprised of QVC U.S. and HSN, Inc. (“QxH”) and QVC International. QVC markets and sells a wide variety of\nconsumer products in the United States (“U.S.”) and several foreign countries via highly engaging video-rich, interactive shopping\nexperiences, primarily by means of its televised shopping programs and the Internet through its domestic and international websites and\nmobile applications. Cornerstone Brands, Inc. (“CBI”), consists of a portfolio of aspirational home and apparel brands, and is a reportable\nsegment.\nOur “Corporate and other” category includes corporate activity along with various cost method investments. Prior to the divesture of\nZulily, LLC (“Zulily”) described below, Zulily’s results were reported in Corporate and other.\nZulily was a wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail until its divestiture on May 24, 2023. Qurate Retail recognized a loss on the\ndivestiture of $64 million in the second quarter of 2023. Zulily is included in Corporate and other through May 23, 2023 and is not\npresented as a discontinued operation as the disposition did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on Qurate Retail’s\noperations and financial results.\nIncluded in revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations is $301 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, related to Zulily. Included in net earnings (loss) in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations\nare losses of $44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to Zulily.\nStrategies\nOn June 27, 2022, Qurate Retail announced a five-point turnaround plan designed to stabilize and differentiate its core QVC U.S. and\nHSN brands and expand the Company's leadership in video streaming commerce (“Project Athens”). Project Athens main initiatives\ninclude: (i) improve customer experience and grow relationships; (ii) rigorously execute core processes; (iii) lower cost to serve; (iv)\noptimize the brand portfolio; and (v) build new high growth businesses.\nImprove customer experience and grow relationships. Qurate Retail is focused on rebuilding stronger connections with our\ncustomers. In order to improve customer experience and grow relationships, Qurate Retail is working to optimize programming using\nadvanced analytics to align product offerings, promotions and airtime with customer preferences. In addition, we are investing in\ninfrastructure which will endeavor to improve the customer's order to delivery experience by reducing shipping time and improving\nshipment tracking visibility. We will continue to focus on customer loyalty through providing customers with a more personalized shopping\nexperience.\nRigorously execute core processes. Qurate Retail is enhancing its core processes to deliver the human story telling experience behind\na product while also sharing a clear and compelling value proposition. In order to rigorously execute core processes, Qurate Retail will\noptimize pricing and assortment by investing in enhanced information technology (“IT”) systems that support real-time pricing and\npromotion adjustments at an item level. We are focused on growing our private label brands in an effort to drive revenue and margin at a\nproductive scale.\nI-26\nTable of Contents\nLower cost to serve. Qurate Retail is right sizing its cost base to improve profitability and cash generation. In order to lower cost to\nserve, Qurate Retail has enhanced review of spending to identify cost savings opportunities and opportunities to create new operational\nefficiencies, through end-to-end product and process reviews, and leveraging technology and process automation. Additionally, we have\nimproved product margin through lower fulfillment costs, freight optimization and higher productivity.\nOptimize the brand portfolio. Qurate Retail divested Zulily in the second quarter of 2023, consistent with its goal of optimizing the\nbrand portfolio. Qurate Retail is exploring untapped opportunities to maximize brand value.\nBuild new high growth business. Finally, Qurate Retail is focused on expanding in the video streaming shopping market. In order to\nbuild new high growth businesses, Qurate Retail is working to expand streaming viewership by improving the current streaming experience\nwith enhanced video and navigation and seamless transactions. Additionally, we are shaping the future streaming experience with exclusive\ncontent, program and deal concepts. We are also building a next generation shopping app featuring vendors with self-made content.\nDuring 2022, QVC commenced the first phase of Project Athens, including actions to reduce inventory and a planned workforce\nreduction that was completed in February 2023. QVC recorded restructuring charges of $13 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of\noperations. These initiatives are consistent with QVC’s strategy to operate more efficiently as it implements its turnaround plan.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, QVC entered into an agreement and announced a plan to shift its global operating model for IT\nservices to a managed services model. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, QVC recorded restructuring charges\nof $18 million in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nTrends\nQVC’s future net revenue will depend on its ability to grow through digital platforms, retain and grow revenue from existing\ncustomers, and attract new customers. QVC's future net revenue may also be affected by (i) the willingness of cable television and direct-\nto-home satellite system operators to continue carrying QVC's programming service; (ii) QVC's ability to maintain favorable channel\npositioning, which may become more difficult due to governmental action or from distributors converting analog customers to digital;\n(iii) changes in television viewing habits because of video-on-demand technologies and Internet video services; (iv) QVC's ability to source\nnew and compelling products; and (v) general economic conditions.\nThe current economic uncertainty in various regions of the world in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate, has impacted and\ncould continue to adversely affect demand for our products and services since a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from\ndiscretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls, to varying degrees, during times of economic instability and inflationary\npressures. Global financial markets may experience disruptions, including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and credit\navailability. If economic and financial market conditions in the U.S. or other key markets, including Japan and Europe, continue to be\nuncertain or deteriorate, our customers may respond by suspending, delaying or reducing their discretionary spending. Any further\nsuspension, delay or reduction in discretionary spending could adversely affect revenue. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain\nrevenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments decline. Such weak economic\nconditions may also inhibit our expansion into new European and other markets. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of\nthese potential adverse effects.\nThe Company has continued to see inflationary pressures during the period including higher wages and merchandise costs consistent\nwith inflation experienced by the global economy. If these pressures persist, inflated costs may result in certain increased costs outpacing\nour pricing power in the near term.\nDue to a goodwill impairment related to the QxH reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2023, the fair value of goodwill does not\nsignificantly exceed its carrying value. The Company will continue to monitor QVC’s current business\nI-27\nTable of Contents\nperformance versus the current and updated long-term forecasts, among other relevant considerations, to determine if the carrying value of\nits assets (including Goodwill) is appropriate. Future outlook declines in revenue, cash flows, or other factors could result in a sustained\ndecrease in fair value that may result in a determination that carrying value adjustments are required, which could be material.\nFire at Rocky Mount Fulfillment Center\nOn December 18, 2021, QVC experienced a fire at its Rocky Mount fulfillment center in North Carolina. Rocky Mount was QVC’s\nsecond-largest fulfillment center, processing approximately 25% to 30% of volume for QVC U.S., and also served as QVC U.S.’s primary\nreturns center for hard goods. The building was significantly damaged as a result of the fire and related smoke and did not reopen. QVC\ntook steps to mitigate disruption to operations including diverting inbound orders, leveraging its existing fulfillment centers and\nsupplementing these facilities with short-term leased space as needed. QVC sold the property in February 2023 and received cash proceeds\nof $2 million and $19 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively and recognized gains on the sale of\n$2 million and $17 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. QVC assessed its network footprint\nand is making investments to expand capacity and increase throughput as a result of the loss of the Rocky Mount fulfillment center.\nBased on the provisions of QVC’s insurance policies certain fire related costs were recoverable. In June 2023, QVC agreed to a final\ninsurance settlement with its insurance company and received all remaining proceeds related to the Rocky Mount claim. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, QVC received $280 million of insurance proceeds, of which $210 million represented recoveries for\nbusiness interruption losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, QVC recorded $5 million and $32 million of fire\nrelated costs, respectively, and recognized net losses of $5 million and net gains of $208 million, respectively, representing proceeds\nreceived in excess of recoverable losses, in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nSale-leaseback Transactions\nIn November 2022, QVC International entered into agreements to sell two properties located in Germany and the United Kingdom\n(“U.K.”) to an independent third party. Under the terms of the agreements, QVC received net cash proceeds of $102 million related to its\nGerman facility and $80 million related to its U.K. facility when the sale closed in January 2023. Concurrent with the sale, QVC entered\ninto agreements to lease each of the properties back from the purchaser over an initial term of 20 years with the option to extend the terms\nof the property leases for up to four consecutive terms of five years. QVC recognized a $69 million and $44 million gain related to the\nsuccessful sale-leaseback of the German and U.K. properties, respectively, during the first quarter of 2023 calculated as the difference\nbetween the aggregate consideration received and the carrying value of the properties. The Company accounted for the leases as operating\nleases and recorded a $42 million and $32 million right-of-use asset and operating lease liability for the German and U.K. properties,\nrespectively.\nIn December 2023, QVC entered into an agreement to sell an owned and operated property in Germany to an independent third party.\nThis property was owned and considered held for sale as of December 31, 2023, and is included in other assets, at cost, net of accumulated\namortization in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Under the terms of the agreement, QVC received net cash proceeds of $6 million\nrelated to its German facility when the sale closed in February 2024. QVC recognized a $1 million gain related to the sale during the first\nquarter of 2024, calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration received and the carrying value of the property.\nConcurrent with the sale, QVC entered into an agreement to lease a portion of the property back over two years and recorded an operating\nlease right-of-use asset and operating lease liability of $1 million.\nI-28\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations—Consolidated\nGeneral. We provide in the tables below information regarding our consolidated Operating Results and Other Income and Expense,\nas well as information regarding the contribution to those items from our principal reporting segments. The \"Corporate and other\" category\nconsists of those assets or businesses which we do not disclose separately. For a more detailed discussion and analysis of the financial\nresults of the principal reporting segments, see \"Results of Operations—Businesses\" below.\nOperating Results\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in millions\nRevenue\nQxH $ 1,521 1,617 4,618 4,836\nQVC International 571 577 1,719 1,775\nCBI 252 285 756 860\nCorporate and other — — — 301\nConsolidated Qurate Retail $ 2,344 2,479 7,093 7,772\nOperating Income (Loss)\nQxH $ 107 91 307 468\nQVC International 57 63 177 290\nCBI (2) 4 6 17\nCorporate and other (10) (7) (28) (82)\nConsolidated Qurate Retail $ 152 151 462 693\nAdjusted OIBDA\nQxH $ 182 201 561 525\nQVC International 70 77 222 226\nCBI 6 11 31 40\nCorporate and other (8) (4) (23) (57)\nConsolidated Qurate Retail $ 250 285 791 734\nRevenue. Consolidated Qurate Retail revenue decreased 5.4% or $135 million and 8.7% or $679 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Revenue declined in all\nsegments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The\ndecrease in Corporate and other revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the divestiture of Zulily in the prior\nyear. See \"Results of Operations—Businesses\" below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of QVC and CBI.\nStock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation includes compensation primarily related to options, restricted stock awards\nand restricted stock units for shares of our common stock that are granted to certain of our officers and employees.\nWe recorded $3 million and $10 million of stock-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $22 million and $40 million of stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year were\nprimarily due to decreases at QxH and at the corporate level. As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to\nunvested Qurate Retail equity awards was approximately $21 million. Such amount will be recognized in our condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years.\nOperating income. Our consolidated operating income increased $1 million and decreased $231 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, operating income increased $16 million at QxH, partially offset by\nI-29\nTable of Contents\ndecreases of $6 million at QVC International and $6 million at CBI, and an increase in losses of $3 million at the Corporate and other\nsegment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating income declined $161 million at QxH, $113 million at QVC\nInternational and $11 million at CBI. See \"Results of Operations—Businesses\" below for a more complete discussion of the results of\noperations of QVC and CBI. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a decrease in operating\nlosses at the Corporate and other segment of $54 million, primarily related to the divestiture of Zulily in the prior year.\nAdjusted OIBDA. To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted\nOIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and\namortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified impairments, litigation settlements, restructuring,\npenalties, acquisition-related costs, fire related costs, net (including Rocky Mount inventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale-leaseback\ntransactions. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other\nmeasures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important\nindicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each\nbusiness’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform\nanalytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Accordingly, Adjusted\nOIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net earnings (loss), cash flows provided by\noperating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in millions\nOperating income (loss) $ 152 151 462 693\nDepreciation and amortization 95 105 290 309\nStock-based compensation 3 10 22 40\nRestructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) — 19 18 (189)\nGain on sale of assets and leaseback transactions — — (1) (119)\nAdjusted OIBDA $ 250 285 791 734\nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA decreased 12.3% or $35 million and increased 7.8% or $57 million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted OIBDA for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to decreases in Adjusted OIBDA at QxH of $19 million, at QVC\nInternational of $7 million, and at CBI of $5 million, and an increase in Adjusted OIBDA losses at Corporate and other of $4 million,\ncompared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nwas primarily due to an increase in Adjusted OIBDA at QxH of $36 million, and a decrease in Adjusted OIBDA losses at Corporate and\nother of $34 million, partially offset by decreases in Adjusted OIBDA at QVC International of $4 million and at CBI of $9 million,\ncompared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted OIBDA losses in the Corporate and other segment for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the divestiture of Zulily in the prior year. See \"Results of Operations—\nBusinesses\" below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of QVC and CBI.\nI-30\nTable of Contents\nOther Income and Expense\nComponents of Other income (expense) are presented in the table below.\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in millions\nInterest expense $ (117) (119) (353) (336)\nInterest and dividend income 14 14 41 39\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net (36) (14) (53) (60)\nLoss on disposition of Zulily, net — — — (64)\nOther, net (13) 1 (19) 11\nOther income (expense) $ (152) (118) (384) (410)\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $2 million and increased $17 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to the repayment of QVC’s 4.85% Senior Secured\nNotes due 2024 during the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by higher interest on QVC’s Senior Secured Credit Facility due to a higher\noutstanding balance compared to the prior year. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period\nin the prior year, was due to the reversal of interest expense related to the settlement of state income tax reserves at QVC during the prior\nyear.\nInterest and dividend income. Interest and dividend income remained flat and increased $2 million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, was primarily due to a greater amount of cash held in interest bearing accounts.\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial\ninstruments, net are comprised of changes in the fair value of the following:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in millions\nEquity securities (17) (2) (19) (19)\nExchangeable senior debentures (19) (24) (34) (37)\nOther financial instruments — 12 — (4)\n$ (36) (14) (53) (60)\nThe changes in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net are due to market activity in the applicable period\nrelated to the financial instruments that are marked to market on a periodic basis. The increase in realized and unrealized losses for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was primarily driven by increased losses on\nequity securities and no gains on other financial instruments in the current year, partially offset by a decrease in losses on the exchangeable\nsenior debentures driven by decreases in stock prices of the securities underlying the debentures compared to the prior year. The decrease in\nrealized and unrealized losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, was\nprimarily driven by no losses on other financial instruments in the current year, and a decrease in losses on the exchangeable senior\ndebentures driven by decreases in stock prices of the securities underlying the debentures compared to the prior year. The nine months\nended September 30, 2023 was also impacted by a gain of $35 million due to the extinguishment of the Company’s 1.75% Exchangeable\nSenior Debentures due 2046.\nLoss on disposition of Zulily, net. The Company recorded a net loss of $64 million associated with the disposition of Zulily during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023 (see note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements).\nI-31\nTable of Contents\nOther, net. Other, net loss increased $14 million and $30 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increased loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily the result of foreign exchange losses and a loss on the early extinguishment of\ndebt, partially offset by tax sharing expense in the prior year and no tax sharing expense in the current year. The increased losses for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily the result of a loss on the early\nextinguishment of debt compared to a gain in the prior year, tax sharing expense compared to a benefit in the prior year, and increased\nforeign exchange losses.\nIncome taxes. Earnings (loss) before income taxes, income tax (expense) benefit, and the effective tax rates for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in millions\nEarnings (loss) before income taxes $ — 33 78 283\nIncome tax (expense) benefit $ (15) (21) (53) (119)\nEffective tax rate — 64% 68% 42%\nThe Company had zero earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, but income tax expense of $15\nmillion primarily related to foreign income tax expense and non-deductible interest expense related to the 8.0% Series A Cumulative\nRedeemable Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”). Income tax expense was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to foreign income tax expense and non-deductible interest expense related to the\nPreferred Stock. Income tax expense was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% during the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, primarily due to foreign income tax expense and non-deductible interest expense related to the Preferred Stock. Income tax\nexpense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was also impacted by non-deductible stock compensation, and was partially offset\nby a tax benefit from a change in the Company’s effective state tax rate used to measure deferred taxes.\nNet earnings. We had net losses of $15 million and net earnings of $12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and net earnings of $25 million and $164 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe change in net earnings (loss) was the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition\nAs of September 30, 2024, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, securities of\nother government agencies, AAA rated money market funds and other highly rated financial and corporate debt instruments.\nThe following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, equity issuances, dividend and interest receipts, proceeds\nfrom asset sales, debt (including availability under QVC’s bank credit facilities (the “Credit Facility”), as discussed in note 6 to the\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), and cash generated by the operating activities of our wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. Cash generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries is only a source of liquidity to the extent such cash exceeds the\nworking capital needs of the subsidiaries and is not otherwise restricted. For example, under QVC’s bond indentures, it is able to pay\ndividends or make other restricted payments if it is not in default on its senior secured notes and its consolidated leverage ratio is no greater\nthan 3.5 to 1.0. In addition, under the Credit Facility QVC is able to pay dividends or make other restricted payments if it is not in default\non the Credit Facility and the consolidated leverage ratio of QVC, QVC Global Corporate Holdings, LLC and CBI is no greater than 4.0 to\n1.0. Further, under QVC’s bond indentures and the Credit Facility, unlimited dividends are permitted to service the debt of parent entities\nof QVC so long as there is no default (i.e., no leverage test is needed).\nAs of September 30, 2024, QVC’s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC’s senior secured notes) was greater than 3.5\nto 1.0 and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make dividends or other restricted payments under the senior secured notes.\nAlthough QVC will not be able to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments under the senior secured notes leverage basket,\nQVC will continue to be permitted to make unlimited dividends to parent entities of QVC to service the principal and interest when due in\nrespect of indebtedness of such parent entities (so long as there\nI-32\nTable of Contents\nis no default under the indentures governing QVC’s senior secured notes) and permitted to make certain restricted payments to Qurate\nRetail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries.\nAs of September 30, 2024, Qurate Retail's liquidity position included the following:\nCash and cash\nequivalents\namounts in millions\nQVC $ 297\nCBI 100\nCorporate 476\nTotal Qurate Retail $ 873\nBorrowing capacity\namount in millions\nCredit Facility $ 1,753\nTo the extent that the Company recognizes any taxable gains from the sale of assets we may incur tax expense and be required to\nmake tax payments, thereby reducing any cash proceeds.

Approximately 58% of\nQVC’s foreign cash balance was that of QVC-Japan (as defined below). QVC owns 60% of QVC-Japan and shares all profits and losses\nwith the 40% minority interest holder, Mitsui & Co., LTD (“Mitsui”).\nAdditionally, we believe our businesses will generate positive cash flow from operations during 2024.\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\namounts in millions\nCash Flow Information\nNet cash provided (used) by operating activities $ 313 602\nNet cash provided (used) by investing activities $ (149) 18\nNet cash provided (used) by financing activities $ (412) (776)\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Qurate Retail's primary uses of cash were net debt repayments of $354 million,\ncapital expenditures of $137 million, dividends paid to noncontrolling interest of $51 million, and expenditures for television distribution\nrights of $23 million.\nThe projected uses of Qurate Retail cash for the remainder of 2024 are continued capital improvement spending between $50 million\nand $75 million, debt service payments (including approximately $41 million for interest payments on outstanding debt), repayment of\ndebt, and payment of dividends to the holders of the Preferred Stock. We also may be required to make net payments of income tax\nliabilities to settle items under discussion with tax authorities. We expect that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities and\nborrowing capacity in future periods will be sufficient to fund projected uses of cash.\nThe Company may from time to time repurchase any level of its outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated\ntransactions, redemptions, tender offers or otherwise. Repurchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market\nconditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

QVC's consolidated net revenue decreased $102 million or 4.6% and $274 million or 4.1% for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The three month decrease in net\nrevenue is primarily due to a 3.9% decrease in units shipped attributable to QxH, partially offset by an increase in units shipped at QVC\nInternational. The decrease was also driven by a 1.2% decrease in average selling price per unit (\"ASP\") primarily driven by QVC\nInternational, and a $12 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue attributable to QxH. These decreases to net revenue were\npartially offset by a $38 million decrease in estimated product returns primarily attributable to QxH. The nine month decrease in net\nrevenue is primarily due to a 2.7% decrease in units shipped primarily attributable to QxH, partially offset by an increase in units shipped at\nQVC International. The decrease was also driven by a 0.9% decrease in ASP primarily attributable to QVC International, partially offset by\nan increase in ASP at QxH, $49 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and a $19 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue\nattributable to QxH. These decreases to net revenue were partially offset by a $68 million decrease in estimated product returns primarily\ndriven by QxH.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the changes in revenue and expenses were affected by\nchanges in the exchange rates for the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the U.K. Pound Sterling. In the event the U.S. Dollar strengthens against\nthese foreign currencies in the future, QVC's revenue and operating cash flow will be negatively affected.\nIn discussing QVC’s operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates QVC uses to convert\nthe operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. QVC calculates the effect of changes in currency\nexchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the prior period's currency exchange rates. QVC refers to\nthe results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Constant currency operating results refers to operating\nresults without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits\ninvestors to better understand QVC’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nI-35\nTable of Contents\nThe percentage change in net revenue for each of QVC's segments in U.S. Dollars and in constant currency was as follows:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nForeign Currency Foreign Currency\nU.S. Dollars Exchange Impact Constant Currency U.S. Dollars Exchange Impact Constant currency\nQxH (5.9)% —% (5.9)% (4.5)% —% (4.5)%\nQVC International (1.0)% (0.3)% (0.7)% (3.2)% (2.8)% (0.4)%\nQxH’s net revenue decline of $96 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from a 6.4% decrease in units\nshipped and an $11 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue. These declines were partially offset by a $30 million decrease in\nestimated product returns. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, QxH's net revenue decline of $218 million resulted from a 5.2%\ndecrease in units shipped, partially offset by a $60 million decrease in estimated product returns and a 0.6% increase in ASP. For the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, QxH experienced shipped sales declines across all product categories.\nQVC International’s net revenue declined $4 million in constant currency for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a\n3.0% decrease in ASP across all markets except Japan partially offset by a 1.4% increase in units shipped across all markets except Japan.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, QVC International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency in home,\naccessories and electronics with declines across all other product categories except jewelry which remained flat. QVC International's net\nrevenue declined $7 million in constant currency for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decline was due to a 3.4% decrease\nin ASP across all markets. These declines were primarily offset by a 3.0% increase in units shipped across all markets except Italy. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, QVC International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency across all product\ncategories except for apparel and beauty.\nCost of goods sold (excluding depreciation, amortization and fire related costs, net). QVC's cost of goods sold as a percentage of\nnet revenue was 65.3% and 64.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 64.9% and 66.1%\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 is driven by higher warehouse costs primarily at QxH and to a lesser extent QVC International.\nThe decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to product\nmargin favorability across both segments and lower freight costs at QxH, partially offset by higher freight costs at QVC International. The\nproduct margin favorability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by the net impact of merchandising efforts including\ncost reduction and pricing actions, as well as mix within product categories and less inventory liquidation in the current period at QxH.\nOperating expenses. QVC's operating expenses are principally comprised of commissions, order processing and customer service\nexpenses, credit card processing fees and telecommunications expenses. Operating expenses were 7.9% of net revenue for each of the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, and were 8.0% for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases in operating expenses as a percent of sales are driven by lower commissions\nexpense at QxH.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock based compensation). QVC's selling, general and administrative\nexpenses (excluding stock-based compensation) include personnel, IT, marketing and advertising expenses, production costs, and provision\nfor doubtful accounts. Such expenses decreased $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and increased as a percentage of net revenue to 14.8% from 14.4%. Selling, general, and administrative\nexpenses decreased $23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nand increased as a percentage of net revenue to 14.8% from 14.6%. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was\ndriven by a $4 million decrease in consulting expenses and a $4 million decrease in personnel costs both at QxH. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the decrease resulted from a $32 million decrease in consulting expenses primarily at QxH, a $6\nI-36\nTable of Contents\nmillion decrease in non-income related taxes and $5 million of favorability from foreign exchange rates. These decreases were primarily\noffset by a $24 million increase in marketing costs at QxH. The decrease in consulting expenses for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 related to investments in Project Athens made in the prior year. The increase in marketing costs was driven by QVC’s\nAge of Possibility campaign.\nRestructuring, penalties and fire related (costs), net of recoveries (including Rocky Mount inventory losses). QVC recorded\nrestructuring costs of $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the shift in its IT operating model. QVC\nrecorded a loss of $19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a gain of $196 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of recoveries. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the\nloss was primarily related to a Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) civil penalty of $16 million (see note 8 to the\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) and $5 million of other fire related costs, partially offset by a $2 million gain\non the sale of the Rocky Mount property. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain related to a $240 million gain on\ninsurance proceeds received in excess of fire losses and a $17 million gain on the sale of the Rocky Mount property, partially offset by $32\nmillion of other fire related costs, the CPSC civil penalty of $16 million and $13 million of restructuring costs related to workforce\nreduction.\nGains on sales of assets and sale-leaseback transactions. QVC recorded a $1 million gain on sale of assets and sale-leaseback\ntransactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the sale-leaseback of a property in Germany. QVC recorded $119\nmillion of gains on sales of assets and sale-leaseback transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to the\nsale-leaseback of two properties located in Germany and the U.K.\nStock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to options and restricted stock units granted to\ncertain officers and employees. QVC recorded $1 million and $15 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and recorded $7 million and $27 million of stock-based compensation expense for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to a decline in the probability of satisfying performance objectives and changes in\nthe market price of Qurate Retail’s Series A common stock.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $11 million and $14 million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year, and included acquisition related amortization of $15 million for\nboth of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and $46 million for both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to decreased property and equipment\namortization primarily due to assets that are fully depreciated in the current period and a decrease in channel placement amortization and\nrelated expenses due to lower subscriber counts, and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in software amortization\ndue to software assets fully depreciating in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\npartially offset by an increase in software amortization due to software additions.\nCBI. CBI consists of a portfolio of aspirational home and apparel brands. The home brands are comprised of Ballard Designs,\nFrontgate, and Grandin Road, while Garnet Hill focuses primarily on apparel and accessories and is categorized as an apparel brand.

The decrease in net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was\nthe result of a decrease in ASP of 6% related to a product mix shift within the home category to lower priced items, and a decrease in units\nshipped of 6% compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in units shipped was due to softness across home categories. The\ndecrease in net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of a decrease in ASP of 5% related to a product mix\nshift within the home category to lower priced items, and a decrease in units shipped of 7% compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe decrease in units shipped was due to softness across the home categories.\nCBI's cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was 59.9% and 62.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and 59.1% and 62.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases in cost of\ngoods sold as a percentage of net revenue in both periods were primarily due to lower supply chain costs.\nOperating expenses are principally comprised of credit card processing fees and customer service expenses, which are variable\nexpenses that support sales activity. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses decreased $1 million and\n$2 million, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower revenue, as discussed above.\nCBI’s SG&A expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) include print, digital and retail marketing. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as a percentage of net revenue, these expenses increased from 29.5% to 33.7%, primarily attributable to lower revenue\ncompared to the prior year, as discussed above and increased consulting expenses related to business transformation initiatives. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, as a percentage of net revenue, these expenses increased from 29.1% to 32.7%, primarily attributable to\nlower revenue compared to the prior year, as discussed above.\nCBI’s stock-based compensation expense remained flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to the corresponding periods in the prior year.\nCBI’s total depreciation and amortization expense increased $1 million and $4 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to increased capital\ninvestments, primarily in retail stores and technology.\nCBI had restructuring charges of $2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of a corporate restructuring\nin May 2023. The costs related to severance expense and outplacement services.\nI-38\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities and the conduct\nof operations by our subsidiaries in different foreign countries. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock\nprices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair\nvalues, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of\nmarket risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investment activities, which include\ninvestments in fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The\nnature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other\nfactors. We manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We\nbelieve this best protects us from interest rate risk. We have achieved this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated\ninterest rate and significant term to maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates and (iii) entering\ninto interest rate swap arrangements when we deem appropriate. As of September 30, 2024, our debt is comprised of the following\namounts:\nVariable rate debt Fixed rate debt\nWeighted Weighted\nPrincipal average Principal average\namount interest rate amount interest rate\ndollar amounts in millions\nQVC $ 1,280 6.5% $ 2,732 5.8%\nCorporate and other $ — —% $ 1,571 6.1%\nQurate Retail is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related primarily to the monetary assets and liabilities and the financial\nresults of QVC's foreign subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency\nare translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the statements of operations are generally translated at the average\nexchange rate for the period. Exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars that result in\nunrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive earnings (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in\ntransaction gains and losses, which are reflected in income as unrealized (based on period-end translations) or realized upon settlement of\nthe transactions. Cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the period. Accordingly, Qurate\nRetail may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. QVC's reported Adjusted OIBDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been\nimpacted by approximately $2 million, for every 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar.\nI-39\nTable of Contents\nItem 4.
