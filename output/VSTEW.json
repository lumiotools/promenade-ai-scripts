The funding will support Vast’s green technology manufacturing and project development activities as it deploys its next generation concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) solution to deliver the clean, dispatchable power and heat that the world needs.\n\nCSP is an obvious technology to deploy in Australia’s energy transition in one of the sunniest countries on earth. By capturing and storing the sun’s energy as heat, CSP can power homes, industry and transport with green, reliable and affordable energy. The technology’s dispatchable capacity will be a critical complement to intermittent solar PV and wind in Australia’s energy mix, delivering longer-lasting power that’s cost effective when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.\n\nVast has pioneered the next generation of proprietary CSP technology, promising superior performance at lower cost and risk. It has a global pipeline of projects that will help to decarbonise electricity generation and power the production of green methanol and sustainable aviation fuels. Proven at its grid-connected pilot project in New South Wales, Vast’s leading technology is set to be deployed at utility-scale at Vast Solar 1 (“VS1”), a 30MW power plant with 8 hours of storage located in the Port Augusta Green Energy Hub, South Australia.\n\nVast’s Port Augusta utility-scale CSP project will generate clean, dispatchable electricity which will be sold into the National Electricity Market, and it will help to power a world-first co-located green methanol production facility, Solar Methanol 1 (“SM1”), also being developed by Vast. A real world, in-demand application for hydrogen, green methanol has the potential to decarbonise shipping and is already being used to power major container vessels.\n\nVast’s internationally awarded, Australian-made technology is currently produced at its Queensland facility. ARENA’s funding will see Vast scale up its Australian green technology manufacturing to supply VS1 and future projects. The $30 million funding will also support Vast in the final project development activities ahead of Final Investment Decision (FID) on VS1 in early 2025. Vast’s Australian projects and manufacturing facility are anticipated to create dozens of green manufacturing and construction jobs, and long-term plant operations roles.\n\nThe support of the Australian Government has been key for Vast, which has the potential to be a catalyst for a domestic CSP industry and expects to export its green technology around the world to its global pipeline of projects, according to Vast CEO Craig Wood.\n\nWood said, \"Unlocking this funding helps accelerate our Australian green technology manufacturing and the final stages of development for our first utility-scale project. ARENA’s backing has been pivotal, getting us to a point where we are garnering significant interest from investors, industry and international governments keen to explore how our technology can play a key role in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors including electricity, industry and fuels.\n\n“With the continued support of the Australian Government and our investors, we are looking forward to building our next projects, and to helping Australia become an export powerhouse for this next generation of green technology.”\n\nThe $30 million non-dilutive grant will be released from $65 million of funding announced in February 2023 by the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Hon Chris Bowen MP, and ARENA. Construction of VS1 is anticipated to begin in Q2 2025, with capital expenditures estimated to be in the range of AUD360 million - AUD390 million.\n\n![Vast Renewables Limited](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/943211e9-90bd-492d-b33b-c3c83fb5ebc5/image1.jpeg)\n\nVast’s 1.1MW demonstration project in Forbes, New South Wales\n\n**About Vast** Vast is a renewable energy company that has CSP systems to generate, store, and dispatch carbon-free, utility-scale electricity, industrial heat, or a combination to enable the production of green fuels.

VS1 was awarded up to AUD $65 million in conditional grant funding by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). VS1 will be co-located with Vast’s planned Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project, a green methanol demonstration plant led by Vast and German integrated energy giant Mabanaft, which has been awarded up to AUD $19.48 million and up to EUR 13.2 million of conditional grant funding from a collaboration between the Australian and German Governments, respectively.\n\nThe BESS and VS1 are planned to connect to the H2H, providing clean, reliable energy to power Australian homes and businesses. Connection to the H2H will be subject to further negotiations and agreement with OZM and ElectraNet as contemplated under the Term Sheet. The Term Sheet also contains certain termination scenarios including if OZM, in its absolute discretion, is not satisfied with the risks associated with the proposed connections to the H2H following a technical engineering review.\n\nVast’s CEO Craig Wood said, “Decarbonizing Australia’s electricity supply requires that dispatchable renewable energy with long duration storage like that provided by Vast’s proprietary CSP v.3.0 technology be integrated into the Australian electricity grid. Execution of this Term Sheet is an important step forward, and we are looking forward to continuing discussions with BHP to agree commercial and technical terms so we can progress the Precinct.”\n\n**About Vast** Vast is a renewable energy company that has CSP systems to generate, store, and dispatch carbon-free, utility-scale electricity, industrial heat, or a combination to enable the production of green fuels.

In connection with the closing of Vast’s business combination, EDF Australia, a subsidiary of France’s EDF Group, which operates in more than 25 countries worldwide, executed on its capital commitment to Vast of a capital commitment of €10 million in conjunction with an agreement between the companies to partner on development of Australian CSP projects. In addition, Canberra Airport Group executed on its capital commitment valued at $9.2 million.\n\n“The support Vast has received from our strategic partners has been very meaningful to the progress of our company, both from a financial as well as operational standpoint,” said Craig Wood, CEO of Vast. “Canberra Airport Group and EDF Australia have shown their enthusiasm for CSP and their commitment to the clean energy transition through their commitments to Vast, with each bringing their own strategic imperatives to the partnerships with an eye to sustainable aviation fuel production and clean energy production. We are very excited to progress and expand our relationships with these two firms.”\n\nSubsequent to the end of the first half of the Company’s fiscal 2024, Vast announced the award of a total of up to approximately AUD $40.0 million in conditional funding agreements, in conjunction with the Company’s consortium partner, Mabanaft. As a result of the Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project’s selection for funding from the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (HyGATE), Vast will receive up to AUD $19.5 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), and Mabanaft is to receive up to €12.4 million from Projektträger Jülich on behalf of the German government. The funding relates to development of Vast’s Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project in Port Augusta, South Australia, which aims to produce green methanol through use of Vast’s CSP v3.0 technology.\n\n**Operational Events**\n\nDuring the first half of fiscal year 2024, Vast continued to make progress on its first utility-scale project for power generation, known as VS1, located in Port Augusta in South Australia.\n\nOn June 6, 2023 Vast announced the award to Worley Ltd. of contracts for basic engineering and front-end engineering and design (FEED) work for the VS1 project.\n\n“I am pleased by the progress on Vast’s VS1 project and excited by the partnership we have so far forged with Worley,” said Mr. Wood. “Bringing VS1 online using our CSP v3.0 technology will be a team effort, and we could not have selected a better teammate. Initial engineering on this first-of-its-kind project is crucial to its success, and we are confident in Worley’s approach. As VS1 moves forward through calendar 2024, we will look to further expand our world-class team.”\n\n**Key Hires and Board of Directors**\n\nOn August 23, 2023, Vast announced the hiring of Marshall D. (Mark) Smith as chief financial officer. Based between Vast’s Sydney headquarters and Houston, Texas, Mr. Smith brings more than 30 years of experience to the position, including energy industry expertise and leadership in operations, capital allocation, business development, and financial management. Most recently, he was CFO for a Texas-based privately held oil and gas company, having previously served as CFO for Guidon Energy, an oil and gas company that was Blackstone Energy Partners’ largest energy-focused investment. Mr. Smith also held executive positions at California Resources Corporation, Occidental Petroleum, Ultra Petroleum, and J.M. Huber Energy. Prior to that, he served as a Managing Director of Investment banking at Nesbitt Burns Securities (now BMO Capital Markets).\n\nOn September 9, 2023, the Company announced the hiring of Federico Sandoval as project director for the VS1 project. Mr. Sandoval brings a wealth of CSP expertise and a global track record of success to this role. His previous role as construction manager at Noor Energy in the UAE and his prior experiences with multiple CSP projects worldwide should make him an invaluable contributor to the Vast team and the delivery of VS1.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, the Company announced its complete seven-member board of directors. Vast’s board of directors is comprised of Chairman Peter Botten, an experienced energy executive, including over 26 years as managing director of Oil Search; Vast CEO Craig Wood; William Restrepo, chief financial officer of Nabors Industries Inc.; Colleen Calhoun, formerly of General Electric and Quaise Energy; Tom Quinn, an experienced energy and infrastructure executive with global experience; Colin Richardson, an experienced investment banker; and John Yearwood, an experienced board member and former CEO, President and COO of Smith International, Inc.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nFor the six months ending December 31, 2023 Vast reported total revenue of $768,000, compared to $547,000 for the same period in 2022. This included approximately $440,000 in revenue received in the form of grants and approximately $328,000 in revenue received from customers. The overall increase in revenue during the six months ending December 31, 2023 was related to (a) increased activity in relation to the design, engineering and project management services for a solar facility owned by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), and (b) higher estimated refundable Research & Development tax rebate recoveries due to higher spend incurred on eligible activities.\n\nDuring the period, Vast reported a net loss of ($281.5) million compared to a net loss of ($3.9) million during the previous year’s period. This is equal to diluted loss per share of ($66.44) for the six months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to diluted loss per share of ($1.83) for the same period in 2022. The increase in net loss was primarily related to non-cash accounting activities related to the close of the business combination, predominantly (a) share based listing expense recognized upon consummation of the business combination, amounting to $106.0 million, and (b) the loss realized recorded upon conversion of Convertible financial instruments previously issued by Vast, immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination, amounting to $170.4 million.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the Company had total available cash and equivalents of $16.5 million compared to $2.1 million on June 30, 2023. The Company reported total debt outstanding of $5.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $26.9 million as of June 30, 2023.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Vast had total diluted common shares outstanding of 29,291,884.\n\n**About Vast**\n\nVast is a renewable energy company that has CSP systems to generate, store, and dispatch carbon-free, utility-scale electricity and industrial heat, and to enable the production of green fuels. Vast’s CSP v3.0 approach to CSP utilizes a proprietary, modular sodium loop to efficiently capture and convert solar heat into these end products.\n\nOn December 19, 2023, Vast was listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “VSTE”, while remaining headquartered in Australia.\n\nVisit www.vast.energy for more information.\n\n**Contacts**\n\nFor Investors: Caldwell Bailey ICR, Inc.

Refer to note 19 - Capital reorganization (the “SPAC Merger”) for further details.\n\nThe accompanying notes form part of the consolidated financial statements\n\n**Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements**\n\n1. **General information**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise of Vast Renewables Limited (formerly Vast Solar Pty Ltd) and the entities it controls. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “Vast” mean Vast Renewables Limited and the entities it controls.\n\nVast is an Australian public company limited by shares incorporated on March 27, 2009. We are a leading renewable energy company that has developed concentrated solar power (CSP) systems to generate, store and dispatch carbon free, utility-scale electricity and industrial heat, and to enable the production of green fuels. Our unique approach to CSP utilizes a proprietary, modular sodium loop to efficiently capture and convert solar heat into these end products. Our vision is to provide continuous carbon-free energy globally by deploying our CSP technology and complementary technologies (e.g., intermittent solar PV and wind) to deliver renewable and dispatchable electricity, heat and storage on a continuous basis. We believe our CSP technology is capable of providing competitive, dispatchable and carbon-free power for on- and off-grid power generation applications, energy storage, process heat, and has the potential to unlock green fuels production.\n\nVast's registered office and principal place of business is as follows:\n\nLevel 7, Suite 02, 124 Walker Street  \n---  \nNorth Sydney  \nNSW 2060  \n  \nWith consummation of the SPAC Merger with Nabors Energy Transition Corp. (“NETC”) on December 18, 2023 (the “Closing Date”) as provided in note 19, this transaction is accounted for as a capital reorganization. The SPAC Merger, which is not within the scope of IFRS 3 as NETC does not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3, is accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2. As such, the SPAC Merger was achieved with the Company issuing shares to NETC shareholders in exchange for the net liabilities of NETC ($11.2 million) as of the Closing Date, accompanied by a share recapitalization. The net liabilities of NETC are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Any excess of the fair value of the Company’s shares issued considering a fair value of the Vast Ordinary Shares of $11.99 per share (price of Vast Ordinary Shares at the Closing Date) over the fair value of NETC’s identifiable net liabilities acquired represents compensation for the service of a share exchange listing for its shares and is expensed as incurred (“share based listing expense”) and further details of share based listing expense is provided in note 19.\n\nAs a result of the SPAC Merger, NETC became a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company. On December 19, 2023, the Ordinary Shares and public Vast Warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, or “Nasdaq,” under the symbols “VSTE” and “VSTEW,” respectively.\n\nThe following table provides information relating to our directors and executive officers as of the date of approving these condensed financial statements.\n\n**Name**| **Age**| **Position**  \n---|---|---  \nCraig Wood| 46| Chief Executive Officer and Director  \nMarshall (Mark) D. Smith*| 63| Chief Financial Officer  \nKurt Drewes| 50| Chief Technology Officer  \nAlec Waugh| 57| General Counsel  \nSue Opie| 56| Chief People Officer  \nPeter Botten*| 68| Chairman  \nColleen Calhoun*| 57| Director  \nThomas Quinn*| 62| Director  \nWilliam Restrepo*| 63| Director  \nColin Richardson*| 62| Director  \nJohn Yearwood*| 64| Director  \n  \n* appointed during the six months ended December 31, 2023 or since, before approving these condensed financial statements.\n\n2. **Significant accounting policies** a) **Basis of preparation**\n\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the half-year reporting period ended December 31, 2023 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 _Interim Financial Reporting_. These financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), as applicable to interim financial reporting.\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Therefore, these financial statements should be read together with the annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the Company’s 2023 annual financial statements, except as disclosed below in note 1 (c).\n\nFunctional and presentation currency\n\nThe functional currency of Vast is Australian dollars (“AUD”) being the primary economic environment in which it operates. The presentation currency of Vast is United States (“US” or “$”) dollars. b) **Going concern**\n\nVast incurred a net loss of $281.5 million and $3.9 million for the half-years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively and used net cash in operating activities of $28.0 million and $2.8 million for the half-years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net current assets of $7.1 million and total net assets of $2.2 million. As of December 31, 2023, promissory notes totalling $5.4 million held by EDF were outstanding and included in the Company’s liabilities.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Vast issued an additional 681,620 Ordinary Shares to Nabors Lux 2 S.a.r.l (“Nabors”) for a consideration of $7.0 million pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement, as contemplated in the Business Combinations Agreement (“BCA”). In addition, under the BCA, Nabors granted Vast a term loan in the form of the Backstop Loan Agreement in an amount of up to $5.0 million which Vast expects to draw upon within the next 12 months. \n\nThe Company is forecasting that it will continue to incur significant operating cash outflows to fund the contracting, construction and commissioning of its current projects and to meet all of its obligations, including interest and principal payments on the outstanding debt. In particular, the development and delivery of projects “VS1” (a 30 MW / 288 MWh reference CSP plant located in Port Augusta, South Australia) and “SM1” (a 20 ton per day solar methanol demonstration facility that will be co-located with and partially powered by VS1) will require substantial funding. These projects are expected to rely on outside sources of financing. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) has announced funding of up to AUD 65 million on February 13, 2023 for VS1. On January 27, 2023, ARENA also announced that Vast will receive up to AUD 19.5 million from ARENA and Vast’s consortium partner, Mabanaft will receive up to EUR 12.4 million from Projektträger Jülich on behalf of the German government for SM1, in each case as part of the HyGATE Program. The funding awards for VS1 and SM1 are each subject to multiple conditions precedent, including but not limited to the ability to provide sufficient equity to meet the balance of funding requirements for the projects, the projects achieving financial close prior to specified dates and securing relevant permitting and approvals such as a grid connection. In addition, the Australian Federal government has announced financial support for the development of VS1 of up to AUD 110 million, the terms and conditions of which (including, inter alia, achievement of financial close of VS1 by a specified date) are to be negotiated with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water and approved by the Australian Federal Government.\n\nVast intends to raise additional funding through an external capital raise commencing early in the financial year ending June 30, 2025. Vast’s ability to pursue its growth strategy and to continue as a going concern is principally dependent on the ability of the Company to meet its cash flow forecasts and to raise additional funding as and when necessary. \n\nAs a result of the above, there is material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt (or raise substantial doubt as contemplated by PCAOB standards) on Vast’s ability to continue as a going concern, and therefore, that the Company may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nc) **Application of new and amended accounting standards adopted by the group**\n\nA number of amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amended standards.\n\n3. **Revenue from customers**\n\n**Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n---  \n**2023**| **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nConsulting fees| $| 326| $| 146  \nMargin fees| 2| 62  \n$| 328| $| 208  \n  \n**_Consulting fees_**\n\nRevenue from consulting fees is recognised predominantly in relation to the design, engineering and project management services for a solar facility owned by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), based on the actual services provided to them at the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. Revenue is recognised over time as the customer receives and uses the benefits from consulting services simultaneously. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total expected labour hours for each project or contract.\n\nEstimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenue or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the change become known by management.\n\nIn the case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered by Vast exceed the payment, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognised.\n\n**_Margin fees_**\n\nIn relation to the facility mentioned above, Vast is charging a margin fee in the form of 10% administration and handling fee for the procurement of equipment, components, and materials on behalf of CSIRO. The Company recognises revenue from procurement service at a point in time when goods are acquired and are presented net of relevant gross receipts and gross payments.\n\n4. **Grant revenue**\n\n**_Research and Development tax incentives_** In order to encourage the industry to invest more in R&D, the Australian government offers a tax incentive that reduces the Company’s R&D costs by offering tax offsets for eligible R&D expenditure. Under the R&D Tax Incentive, Vast is eligible to receive a refundable R&D tax offset in respect of its eligible R&D expenditure.\n\n**_R &D tax incentives _**  \n---  \n**Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n**2023**| **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nRefundable R&D tax offset for the half-year| $| 440| $| 339  \nR&D Tax credit recoveries recognised as grant income| $| 440| $| 339  \n  \n5. **Expenses**\n\nNet loss includes the following expenses:\n\n**Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n---  \n**2023**| **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n_Administrative and other expenses:_  \nShare based payment expenses (1)| $| 750| $| -  \nLegal and accounting expenses| 3,781| 1,050  \nOther expenses| 954| 268  \n$| 5,485| $| 1,318  \n _Gain/loss on derivative financial instruments:_  \nRealised loss on Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 4, and Senior Convertible Notes issued to AgCentral (2)| $| 170,376| $| -  \nUnrealised gain on Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 4, and Senior Convertible Notes issued to AgCentral| -| (5| )  \nUnrealised gain on Promissory Note issued to EDF  (2) | (4,666| )| -  \nUnrealised gain on NETC Warrants  (2) | (1,414| )| -  \n$| 164,296| $| (5| )  \n  \n(1) Refer to note 14 – Reserves for more details relating to share based payment expenses.(2) Refer to note 16 – Financial Instruments – Fair values and financial risk management for further details.\n\n_Finance costs:_  \n---  \nInterest expense on Convertible Note 3 – AgCentral| $| 431| $| 449  \nInterest expense on Convertible Note 4 – AgCentral| 506| 459  \nInterest expense on Convertible Note 5 – AgCentral| 58| 61  \nInterest expense on Senior Convertible Notes – AgCentral & Nabors| 309| -  \nInterest expense on Loans from shareholders – AgCentral| 159| 118  \nInterest expense on Promissory Note – EDF| 43| -  \nOther| 3| 67  \n$| 1,509| $| 1,154  \n  \n6. **Income tax expense**\n\nThe standard rate of corporations’ tax applied to taxable profit is 25% for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Vast has unused tax losses of $6.2 million for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised for the unused tax losses as they are not likely to generate taxable income in the foreseeable future. Income tax expense is recognised based on management’s estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year. As management has determined that the recognition criteria associated with Deferred Tax Assets, including Deferred Tax Assets arising from unused losses is not satisfied, whereby it must be probable that future taxable profits will arise, no income tax expense has been recorded and therefore there is no effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nDuring the half-year ended December 31, 2023, as part of the BCA, Vast entered into a Noteholder Support and Loan Termination Agreement whereby each of the convertible promissory notes held by AgCentral Energy were discharged and terminated in exchange for Vast shares, as repayment of all the principal outstanding and accrued interest immediately prior to the BCA. As such requirements of the Commercial Debt Forgiveness provisions of the income tax legislation applied, and a gain on forgiveness arose where the market value of the commercial debt amount released was greater than the market value of the shares issued. The net forgiven amount upon consummation of the BCA was $17.1 million. The gain on forgiveness was applied to reduce the tax losses brought forward as at June 30, 2023, certain expenditure amounts incurred in previous income years, and the cost base of certain Capital Gains Tax assets.\n\n**7.****Trade and other receivables**\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nTrade receivables| 624| 4  \nGoods and Service Tax receivable| 170| 204  \nOther receivables| 171| 106  \n965| 314  \n  \n**8.****Prepaid expenses**\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nPrepaid insurance| 2,566| 29  \nOther prepaid expenses| 24| 15  \n2,590| 44  \n  \nAs at December 31, 2023, the balance of prepaid insurance is predominantly made of the one year cover for Directors and Officers, effective from the date of the SPAC Merger.\n\n**9.****Trade and other payables**\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nTrade payables| 5,207| 1,265  \nAccrued expenses| 3,994| 4,280  \nOther payables| 210| 79  \n9,411| 5,624  \n  \nTrade payables and accrued expenses as at December 31, 2023 are predominantly made of business combination related consulting and advice costs, and an accrual for excise tax ($2.9 million) to reflect the cash payment of the U.S. Federal Government Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 1% excise tax for the repurchases of stock.

Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, with substantially the same terms as those of the NETC Warrant Agreements.\n\n  * NETC Warrants Issuance date: November 16, 2021, transferred to Vast on December 18, 2023\n  * Maturity date: 5 years from the date of consummation of the BCA\n  * Exercisable: at any time after 30 days from the date of consummation of the BCA\n  * Private Warrants may not be sold or transferred for 30 days from the date of consummation of the BCA\n  * Public Warrants may be redeemed by the issuer at a nominal price if the stock price, when the Warrant is exercisable, reaches a threshold price for 20 out of 30 consecutive days as follows: \n    * Redemption price: $0.01\n    * Threshold price: $18.00\n\n\n\nEffective upon consummation of the BCA,\n\n  * each Vast Warrant is exercisable solely for Vast Ordinary Shares;\n  * the number of Vast Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise of each Vast Warrant is equal to the number of shares of NETC Class A Common Stock issued upon exercise of the applicable NETC Warrant;\n  * the per share exercise price for the Vast Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such Vast Warrant is equal to the per share exercise price for the shares of NETC Class A Common Stock subject to the applicable NETC Warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the consummation of the BCA.\n\n\n\nBoth Public and Private Warrants are accounted for as liabilities under IFRS 9 following consummation of the BCA and valued at the Public Warrants trading price.

The key contractual terms of the Promissory Note have been summarised below:\n\n  1. The Noteholder is EDF Australia Pacific Pty Ltd.\n  2. The Promissory Note has a Face Value equivalent to EURO 10,000,000 converted into US $10,831,953 at the USD:EUR exchange rate on Bloomberg on the Closing Date.\n  3. The Promissory Note will accrue interest at 3% per annum. Interest accrues daily on the daily balance of the Outstanding Principal Amount.\n  4. The Promissory Note has a term of 5 years from the date of issuance; however the Maturity Date may be extended for a period of 2 years at HoldCo’s option by written notice to EDF. On written notice from HoldCo, EDF must extend.\n  5. EDF has the right to exchange all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount and interest on the Promissory Note at an exchange rate of US $10.20 per share for a period of 5 years (7 years, if extended) following closing. Any partial exchange cannot be less than US$2,000,000. The exchange is conditional on satisfaction of an exchange condition being, EDF has invested at least US$20,000,000 in the project entity of a CSP Project. The project entity of a CSP Project pertains to the standalone entity incorporated for the purpose of developing the CSP project. EDF can elect an amount up to 75% of its equity contribution to the project entity. The remaining portion is Vast's contribution. A separate Joint Venture agreement will also be entered into for each approved CSP project. This is governed by the ‘Joint Development Agreement’ entered into between Vast Parent and EDF in connection with the ‘Note Purchase Agreement’. Please refer to note 17 - Contingent assets, liabilities & commitment for further discussion on the Joint Development Agreement.\n  6. New investment clause: \n    1. If Vast enters into an agreement with certain parties, pursuant to which these parties will pay or contribute funds to Vast, the terms of the agreement in respect to security or priority; duration; or interest rate should not be more favourable than that of the Promissory Note. If the terms are more favourable, then the terms to the agreement will be automatically amended to match such other parties’ terms.\n    2. If Vast enters into an agreement to raise capital from third party strategic investors through a privately negotiated transaction and any such funds are used to repay the Nabors Backstop then the terms should be no less favourable than the terms of the Promissory Note. If so, the terms of the Promissory Note shall be automatically amended.\n\n\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, management has evaluated that HoldCo remains in compliance with all covenants, financial (including a prohibition on the declaration or payment of dividends) and non-financial, with respect to the EDF Promissory Note such that non-current classification of the liability is appropriate on the Condensed Statement of Financial Position.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Vast has evaluated its issuance of the note to determine if the components qualify as derivatives requiring separate recognition in its financial statements. The Company has determined the New investment clause, conversion and interest settlement features at the option of noteholder, to be an ‘embedded derivative’ requiring recognition separate from the borrowings. After the recognition of the embedded derivative, the Company recognises the promissory note at amortised cost, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis over the tenure of the note.\n\nThe result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is revalued at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability, and the change in fair value during the reporting period is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The current or non-current classification of derivative instruments is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe embedded derivative as part of such contracts have been tabulated below:\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**Component**| **Particulars**| **2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nEmbedded derivative| Promissory Note – EDF| 950| -  \n950| -  \n  \nOn issuance date, the Embedded derivative liability was recognised for $5.5 million. The Company’s closing share price on the first day of trading, i.e. $11.99 was used, being the closest observable market price to the valuation date. As at December 31, 2023 the valuation of the instrument was measured at $1.0 million, the reduction being predominantly driven by the significant decrease in the Company’s share price during the period since issuance ($5.19 as at December 31, 2023). The conversion option was measured at fair value through profit or loss, driving an unrealised gain of $4.5 million during the period ended December 31, 2023.

Each outstanding note can be converted into one ordinary share (‘conversion’).\n  3. Coupon interest is payable at the rate of 8% per annum on the principal outstanding. Interest accrues daily and is payable every six months.\n  4. Within the first 18 months of issuance, Vast has the option to settle interest payments in cash or by issuance of additional convertible notes. After the first 18 months, the Noteholder has the option to choose settlement of interest by payment in cash or by issuance of additional convertible notes (‘interest settlement’). As of June 30, 2023, there has been no conversion election from the Noteholder. Refer to note 13 – Issued capital for details on conversion of these notes upon consummation of the BCA.\n  5. The latest modified maturity date of all convertible notes was October 31, 2021 prior to the extensions noted below.\n\n\n\nOn June 25, 2021, Vast received an interest waiver from the noteholder, where interest was forgiven from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 on all convertible notes along with a revised maturity date of December 31, 2022.

Further, on June 30, 2023, Vast received another interest waiver, where interest on Convertible notes 3, 4 and 5 was forgiven from January 1, 2023 to the earlier of the effective date of the BCA and December 31, 2023.\n\nSenior Convertible Notes issued by Vast were subjected to the following terms:\n\n  1. The Noteholder of Tranche 2 is AgCentral Energy Pty Ltd, the parent entity of Vast. The Noteholder of Tranches 1 and 3 is Nabors Lux 2 S.a.r.l.\n  2.

On exchange date, the Company recognised the new issued shares at the carrying amount of Legacy Vast Shares from the condensed statement of financial position (including the Capital Contribution Reserve associated to AgCentral, forming part of Vast’s opening reserves as of July 1, 2023), and\n      2. convertible notes and other indebtedness of Vast towards AgCentral. On conversion to equity, the Company derecognised the financial liabilities at their carrying amount from the condensed statement of financial position and recognised them as issued capital. This includes the derivative financial liabilities associated with the notes.\n  2. An aggregate of 1,250,014 Ordinary Shares upon conversion of Senior Convertible Notes held by AgCentral and Nabors Lux.\n  3. An aggregate of 804,616 Ordinary Shares upon conversion of shares of NETC Class A Common Stock to the holders thereof. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, each share of NETC Class A Common Stock (other than Redemption Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were exchanged for a number of Ordinary Shares. This includes 633,250 shares of NETC Class A Common Stock purchased by CAG to satisfy its’ financing obligations.\n  4. An aggregate of 3,000,000 Ordinary Shares upon conversion of Founder Shares (On March 30, 2021, NETC was funded with $25,000 for which it issued 8,625,000 shares of Class F common stock, par value $0.0001 per share - the “Founder Shares”) to the holders thereof, and an aggregate of 1,500,000 Ordinary Shares to former members of NETC Sponsor as acceleration of a portion of the Earnback Shares, pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement. Includes and 129,911 Ordinary Shares issued upon conversion of the Founder Shares transferred to CAG prior to the SPAC Merger in connection with CAG’s investments. Pursuant to the CAG Non-Redemption Agreement, CAG agreed not to redeem the shares of NETC’s Class A common stock, in exchange for Nabors agreeing to issue to CAG 129,911 Vast Ordinary Shares. On conversion, the difference between the fair value of the shares issued and net assets/liabilities acquired has been recorded as share based payment expense. Refer to note 19 – Capital reorganization (the “SPAC Merger”) for further information.\n  5. 350,000 Ordinary Shares to Nabors Lux pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement issued as Incremental Funding Commitment Fee.\n  6.

They have been recognised as an incremental share based payment upon consummation of the BCA under IFRS 2. Refer to note 19 – Capital reorganization (the “SPAC Merger”) for further details on the share based listing expense.\n\nThe fair value of the Earnouts has been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the pay-off based on contractual terms using the following key inputs:\n\n  * underlying asset value: a range of value between AUD $1 million to AUD $4 million\n  * closing stock price at valuation date: $11.99\n  * price volatility of the company’s shares, based on guideline companies adjusted for size and leverage: 25%\n  * discounted at the term-matched risk free rate: 3.90%\n\n\n\n_Earnout for Legacy Vast shareholder issuable to AgCentral:_\n\nIn addition, upon the occurrence of Triggering Events I, II, and III discussed above, and of Triggering Event IV” meaning the date on which a notice to proceed is issued under a contract in respect of the procurement of a 30MW/288MWhr concentrated solar power project at Port Augusta in South Australia, 2,799,999 Ordinary Shares are issuable to AgCentral pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement.\n\nThe quoted market price of Vast shares that was used to determine the cost of listing is presumed to include an adjustment for these earnout shares. As a consequence, the fair value of the earnout shares issuable to Legacy Vast shareholders is are already factored into the cost of listing and a separate adjustment was not considered necessary.\n\n**MEP shares (equity settled):**\n\nThe purpose of the Management Equity Plan (“MEP”) was to provide medium to long term incentive to eligible employees and contractors of Vast by having a plan pool limit of 100 shares. 80 shares were issued during the year ended June 30, 2021 at a fair value of AUD $70 per share, with eligible employees and contractors paying cash of AUD $10 per share in addition to providing services to the Company in exchange for those shares. As the shares did not have any vesting conditions, the excess of the grant date fair value of the shares and the amount paid by the employees was therefore recognised as share-based payment expense in full at the time of the grant of the shares. The shares did not carry any voting rights nor rights to any dividends or other distributions. Following the occurrence of a liquidity event as defined in the MEP Deed or as otherwise defined by the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”), the Board in its discretion could allow MEP shareholders an entitlement linked to the exit price in form of cash or conversion to ordinary shares from such an event. As per the MEP Deed, management’s share is 25% of exit proceeds where the sale price is AUD$10 million or less, or 33.33% where it is above AUD$10 million. Vast had historically accounted for the share-based payment as an equity-settled scheme, as Vast had determined that it did not have a present obligation to settle the share-based payment in cash.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, Vast, AgCentral Energy and the participants to the MEP entered into a MEP De-SPAC Side Deed and Amendment to the MEP Deed to clarify a suitable mechanism for MEP participants to realise the economic benefit of their MEP Shares. The key modification terms of the MEP De-SPAC Side Deed and Amendment to the MEP Deed include the introduction of a vesting period and ‘Agreed Fixed Deductions’ to be used in allocation of profits on completion of the BCA. The modification of the terms and conditions of the MEP did not increase the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement and was not beneficial to the MEP participants. As a result, there was no additional expense recognised.\n\nThe MEP shares meet the definition of a share-based payment arrangement as eligible employees and contractors will receive equity instruments in exchange for services provided to the Company, with a partial cash subscription payment. Accordingly, MEP shares are recognised at their grant date fair values of AUD $70 per share, with the difference between cash proceeds received (AUD $10 per share) and the fair value of MEP shares recognised within the share-based payment reserve.\n\nIn addition, immediately prior to the consummation of the BCA, 5 MEP shares were cancelled on December 18, 2023.\n\nUpon consummation of the BCA, the 75 MEP shares issued to eligible employees and contractors of Vast were converted into 2,036,900 Ordinary Shares, forming part of the Legacy Vast issued capital. The 75 MEP shares converted at a rate of 26,453 Vast Ordinary Shares per MEP, with 5 MEP shares receiving an additional 10,581 Vast Ordinary Shares per MEP share. The additional value allocated to these shares were recognised at fair value and expensed immediately through profit or loss within share based payment expense for USD 0.6 million (refer to note 5 – Expenses).\n\n**Shares issued under the Employee share plan for the benefit of participants in Vast’s Equity Remuneration Schemes (equity settled):**\n\nOn December 18, 2023, 264,533 Ordinary Shares were granted to certain employees of Vast and issued to an employee share trust until such time they are vested, out of the previous MEP share pool, which had not been previously granted to any employees prior to the BCA. Vast consolidates the trust. These shares are treated as treasury shares with Nil carrying value as at December 31, 2023. Those shares were issued by Vast at the discretion of AgCentral. As such, Vast made a grant of share based payment to employees, including key management personnel. Refer to note 20 – Related Party transactions for further details.\n\nThe employee shares have the following key terms and conditions attached to them:\n\n  * For the purposes the IFRS 2 charge the fair value at grant date was calculated using $11.99 per share\n  * Vesting Conditions: The shares will vest on expiry of the Disposal Restriction Period.\n  * Service Conditions: The employees have to still be employed on expiry of the Disposal Restriction Period.\n  * Disposal Restriction Period: The shares will be subject to a total restriction on disposal for a period of 12 months commencing on the issue of the shares.\n  * Shares will be held on trust by Vast Employee Share Holdings Pty Ltd as trustee for the Vast Employee Share Trust.\n\n\n\nThese shares have vesting conditions attached to them and therefore a share based payment expense was recorded under IFRS 2 at fair value through profit or loss for USD 0.1 million (refer to note 5 – Expenses).\n\n_Movement in foreign currency translation reserve is as follows:_\n\n**2023**| **2022**  \n---|---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nAs of July 1| 3,285| 2,394  \nMovement during the year| (241| )| 232  \nAs of December 31| 3,044| 2,626  \n  \nTo the extent that the amount recognised in the FCTR arose as a consequence of translating the company's financial statements into the USD presentation currency, these amounts will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n_Movement in capital contribution reserve is as follows:_\n\n**2023**| **2022**  \n---|---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nAs of July 1| 4,591| 3,452  \nInterest forgiveness on convertible notes and shareholder loan| -| 267  \nDerecognition upon consummation of the BCA| (4,591| )| -  \nDeferred tax impact| -| (67| )  \nAs of December 31| -| 3,652  \nThe capital contribution reserve represents the modification adjustment from loan from shareholder and convertible note issued to AgCentral Energy Pty Ltd (Noteholder). The Noteholder agreed to changes to the terms and conditions, which included interest waivers and term extensions as outlined in Note 11 - Borrowings, in their capacity as the shareholder of the entity. The gains arising as a result of the changes to the terms and conditions were therefore recognised directly in equity as a contribution in their capacity as owner. Modification adjustments presented are never reclassified to profit or loss. The balance in the reserve was derecognised against Issued Capital upon the consummation of the BCA and derecognition of the convertible notes.  \n  \n15. **Accumulated losses**\n\n_Movements in accumulated losses were as follows:_\n\n**2023**| **2022**  \n---|---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nAs of July 1| (39,649| )| (24,432| )  \nLoss during the half-year| (281,486| )| (3,937| )  \nAs of December 31| (321,135| )| (28,369| )  \n  \n16. **Financial Instruments – Fair values and financial risk management**\n\nThis note explains Vast’s accounting classifications and fair values including its exposure to financial risks and how these risks could affect Vast’s future financial performance. Current year profit or loss information has been included where relevant to add further context.\n\n**(a) Accounting classifications and fair values**\n\nThe following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial liabilities, including the ones accounted for in Reserves, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy.

A 10% increase in the risk-free rate assumption would not result in a material change in fair value of the derivative financial instrument as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n(4) The following table shows the valuation technique used in measuring level 3 fair values for derivative financial instruments measured at fair value associated with Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 5 and Senior Convertible Notes as well as significant unobservable inputs used:\n\n**Type**| **Valuation technique**| **Significant unobservable inputs**  \n---|---|---  \nDerivative financial instrument designated at fair value – Level 3 hierarchy| Derivative valuations have been determined by a Black-Scholes formula adjusted for dilution| Risk free rate: not applicable (2022: 3.90%)Volatility: not applicable (2022: 40%)  \n  \n**Reconciliation of level 3 fair values**\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for Level 3 fair values.\n\n**Movements in derivative financial instruments**| **(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n---|---  \nOpening balance as of July 1, 2023| 192  \nAdditions – Embedded derivative associated to EDF Promissory Note| 5,616  \nAdditions – Embedded derivative associated to Senior Convertible Notes| 288  \nFair value changes recognised as unrealised loss in profit or loss – Embedded derivative associated with EDF Promissory Note| (4,666| )  \nFair value changes recognised as realised loss in profit or loss – Embedded derivative associated with Senior Convertible Notes| 2,334  \nFair value changes recognised as realised loss in profit or loss – Embedded derivative associated with Convertible Notes 3,4 and 5| 168,042  \nConversion to Issued Capital upon consummation of the BCA - Embedded derivatives associated with Convertible Notes 3,4 and 5 and Senior Convertible Notes| (170,856| )  \nClosing balance as of December 31, 2023| 950  \nOpening balance as of July 1, 2022| 32  \nFair value changes recognised as unrealised gain in profit or loss| (5| )  \nClosing balance as of December 31, 2022| 27  \n  \nFair value changes recognised as realised losses reflect the mark to market valuation for the embedded derivative related to the Existing Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 5, and Senior Convertible Notes for the period from July 1, 2023 to December 18, 2023. The valuation of these instruments immediately prior to the close of the business combination arrangement have utilised a share price of $11.99 as the spot price, being Vast’s closing stock price on December 19, 2023. Derivative valuations have been determined by a Black-Scholes formula adjusted for dilution. Volatility of 40% has been applied as at December 18, 2023 against all tranches. Risk free rates of 5.63% (Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 5) and of 5.15% (Senior Convertible Notes) have been applied as at December 18, 2023.\n\n**(b) Market risk**\n\n**_(i) Foreign exchange risk_** Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not Vast’s functional currency i.e. AUD.\n\n_Exposure_\n\nVast’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in EUR and USD are as follows:\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands)**  \n**Trade payables**  \nEUR| 81| 17  \nUSD| 2,296| 66  \n  \n_Amounts recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive income:_ During the year, the following foreign exchange related amounts were recognised in profit or loss:\n\n**Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n---  \n**2023** | **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n**Amounts recognised in profit or loss**  \nUnrealised Currency Gain/(Loss)| 58| -  \nRealised Currency Gain/(Loss)| (56| )| (8| )  \n2| (8| )  \n  \nGiven the limited exposure, Vast manages its foreign exchange risk exposure by monitoring exchange rates at regular intervals before making an informed decision to transact in such currencies.\n\n**(c) Credit risk**\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to Vast if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations arising principally from Vast’s receivables from customers. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents as well as credit exposures from customers, including outstanding receivables. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.\n\n_Trade receivables_ Vast’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer which are primarily government organisation and joint operator. Vast applies IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. Management believes that Vast's overall exposure to credit risk from Trade receivables to be not material.\n\n_Cash and cash equivalents_ Vast held cash and cash equivalents of $16.5 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties, which are rated AA- based on Standard and Poor’s ratings. Management believes that Vast's overall exposure to credit risk from cash and cash equivalents to be not material.\n\n**(d) Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Vast will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Vast’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to Vast’s reputation.\n\nVast’s exposure to Liquidity risk primarily pertains to promissory notes issued to EDF. Coupon interest is payable at the rate of 3% per annum on the principal outstanding while interest accrues daily and is capitalised and payable at maturity (i.e. December 14, 2028).\n\nDuring the six months ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into the Nabors Backstop Agreement (as amended by the amendment to the Nabors Backstop Agreement dated December 7, 2023) whereby Nabors Lux is to provide $10.0 million backstop to Vast to underwrite the potential investment by additional investors provided that the amount of the backstop be reduced dollar-for-dollar by (a) the balance of cash remaining in the Trust Account after giving effect to any redemptions of NETC Class A Common Stock by NETC public stockholders and (b) amounts invested by additional third parties (other than Nabors, AgCentral, CAG, EDF and their respective affiliates).\n\nDuring the six months ended December 31, 2023, as part of the BCA, Vast entered into a Noteholder Support and Loan Termination Agreement whereby each of the convertible notes held by AgCentral Energy were discharged and terminated in exchange for Vast shares, as repayment of all the principal outstanding and accrued interest immediately prior to the de-SPAC process.\n\n**As of December 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n**Carrying amount**| **Total contractual cash flows**| **2 months or less**| **3-36 months**| **Beyond 36 months**  \nPromissory Note| (5,404| )| 12,457| -| -| (12,457| )  \nDeferred consideration| (976| )| 1,026| -| (1,026| )| -  \nTrade Payables| (9,411| )| 9,411| (9,411| )| -| -  \nWarrants liability| (2,767| )| -| -| (2,767| )| -  \nLease liabilities| (36| )| 36| (7| )| (29| )| -  \nTotal non-derivatives| (18,594| )| 22,930| (9,418| )| (3,822| )|  (12,457| )  \n**As of June 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n**Carrying amount**| **Total contractual cash flows**| **2 months or less**| **3-36 months**| **Beyond 36 months**  \nConvertible notes| (21,415| )| 21,708| -| (21,708| )| -  \nLoan from shareholder| (5,531| )| 5,704| -| (5,704| )| -  \nDeferred consideration| (955| )| 995| -| (995| )| -  \nTrade Payables| (5,624| )| 5,624| (5,624| )| -| -  \nLease liabilities| (54| )| 57| (7| )| (50| )| -  \nTotal non-derivatives| (33,579| )| 34,088| (5,631| )| (28,457| )| -  \nDerivative financial instruments| (192| )| 192| -| (192| )| -  \n  \nIn order to manage its liquidity, whilst the management has secured a level of additional funding, in order to fund the operating cash flows and maintain these minimum liquidity reserve levels, it is likely that additional working capital funding will be required. If Vast is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations and reducing overhead expenses.\n\n17. **Contingent assets, liabilities & commitment**\n\n1) In 2021, the Company received contributions from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in relation to funding a 30 MW concentrated solar thermal power reference plant variation contract (variation funding agreement). In relation to the funding agreement, the arrangement includes a clause on change of control, which indicated that if the Company failed to get funding to build the facility in Australia by May 31, 2024 but obtains finance for an offshore facility before that period, it would give rise to the requirement to repay a proportion of funding received from ARENA. At reporting date and upon entering into BCA, the Company did not identify such circumstances, as significant progress has been made on this facility in Australia. Furthermore, the funding agreement, and hence any contingent liability associated with it, was terminated on August 16, 2023. Refer to note 2 (b) – Going concern for further details regarding the Company’s funding requirements.\n\n2) On December 7, 2023, the Company entered into a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) with EDF, pursuant to which :\n\n  1. the Company and EDF will co-develop CSP Projects on an exclusive basis, subject to certain preexisting exceptions, in (i) Australia and, (ii) subject to certain conditions relating to expanding this exclusivity, other jurisdictions,\n  2. EDF will be provided with a right to elect to invest equity in CSP Projects which become Approved Projects and\n  3. the Company will have the right to be the exclusive supplier of CSP Technology to all Potential Eligible Projects, Eligible Projects and Approved Projects.\n\n\n\nPursuant to the EDF JDA, the parties have agreed to collaborate on certain development activities with respect to CSP Projects. The Company and EDF will establish a steering committee, composed of two appointees from each party, to oversee and govern the activities of the EDF JDA. Costs with respect to Eligible Projects developed under the EDF JDA will be borne by the parties equally. The EDF JDA also specifies that a joint venture agreement (“JVA”) will be entered into for each jointly developed project which reaches a certain stage of development. EDF has a right to invest in Approved Projects for an amount up to (1) 75% of the equity capital for an Approved Project, and (2) up to 75% of the equity capital of VS1, VS3 (a proposed 150 MW CSP facility with 12-18 hours of thermal storage located in Port Augusta, South Australia) and SM1 in the aggregate. Neither party will contribute any pre-existing background intellectual property used in the joint effort; however, intellectual property rights developed or derived by either party in connection with the EDF JDA will be jointly owned by both the Company and EDF, and each party grants the other party a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to other intellectual property used in connection with the EDF JDA.\n\nThe EDF JDA will automatically terminate upon the later of (1) seven years from the closing date of the EDF Note Purchase Agreement and (2) the date the parties entered into a JVA with respect to an Approved Project with an expected nameplate capacity equal to or exceeding 200 megawatts, which may include a JVA for VS1, VS3 and SM1. The EDF JDA contains customary provisions regarding certain events of default and each party’s right to terminate its obligations thereunder. In the event a party contemplates a Change of Control of such party, the other party must first consent to such Change of Control but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if (1) the transferor is the Company, it continues to own 100% of the CSP Technology and the Background IP (as defined therein) and (2) the transferee continues to have the technical and financial capability to perform its obligations under the EDF JDA.As at December 31, 2023, Vast is assessing EDF JDA under the scope of IFRS 11. No further developments have occurred under the JDA that would impact these condensed financial statements.\n\n18. **Subsequent Events**\n\n1) On January 10, 2024, Vast appointed Mr Peter Botten as Chairman and Mr Tom Quinn as non-executive director in addition to its recently expanded Board. Refer to note 1 – General information for detailed composition of the Board.\n\n2) On January 12, 2024, Vast issued an additional 681,620 Ordinary Shares to Nabors Lux for a consideration of $7.0 million pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement, as contemplated in the BCA. The Nabors Backstop Agreement contains a \"most favoured nation clause\" whereby if, prior to the six-month anniversary of the closing of the BCA, and to certain parties during the following three months, Vast completes a capital raise on more favourable terms than those in the Nabors Backstop Agreement, then the shares issued under the Nabors Backstop Agreement may be redeemable for debt or Vast may be required to issue additional equity instruments to Nabors such that the terms of the Nabors Backstop Agreement are equally as favourable. On the basis no issuance of shares has occurred as at December 31, 2023, no receivable was recorded on the Company’s statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023.\n\n3) On February 5, 2024, Vast moved its registered office and principal place of business to the following address:Level 7, Suite 02, 124 Walker StreetNorth SydneyNSW 2060\n\n4) On February 14, 2024, Vast announced, along with its consortium partner Mabanaft, that they have signed funding agreements for up to approximately AUD $40 million for SM1. As announced in January 2023, Vast will receive up to AUD $19.48 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and Mabanaft will receive up to EUR $12.4 million from Projektträger Jülich (PtJ) on behalf of the German government after the SM1 project was selected last year as a part of the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (known as HyGATE).\n\n5) On February 15, 2024, Vast announced that on February 9, 2024, it received a notification (the “Notice”) from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating that the Company is not in compliance with the requirements to maintain a minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (“MVPHS”) of $15,000,000, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) (the “MVPHS Requirement”).\n\nThe Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares (the “Ordinary Shares”), which continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “VSTE.”\n\nThe Notice provided that, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company has a period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until August 7, 2024, to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement. During this period, the Ordinary Shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq. Nasdaq will deem the Company to have regained compliance with the MVPHS Requirement if at any time during this compliance period the Company’s MVPHS closes at $15,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.\n\nIn the event the Company does not regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement by August 7, 2024, the Company will receive written notification from Nasdaq that the Company’s Ordinary Shares are subject to delisting. The Company is reviewing its options for regaining compliance with the MVPHS Requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement in a timely fashion, in which case its securities may be delisted from Nasdaq.\n\n19. **Capital reorganization (the “SPAC Merger”)**\n\nThe SPAC Merger was accounted for as a capital reorganization by Vast. The merger was achieved by Vast issuing shares to NETC shareholders in exchange for the net liabilities of NETC as of the closing date.\n\nThe SPAC Merger was not within the scope of IFRS 3 because NETC did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Rather, the SPAC Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition, with the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration of NETC over the fair value of NETC’s identifiable net liabilities acquired expensed as service for stock exchange listing under IFRS 2.\n\nVast was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the following:\n\n  * Vast’s previous majority shareholder has a majority voting interest;\n  * AgCentral, a Legacy Vast shareholder, has the ability to nominate the majority of the members of the board of directors;\n  * The existing senior management of Vast continues to be the senior management following the SPAC Merger;\n  * The business of Vast comprises the ongoing operations following the SPAC Merger; and\n  * Vast was the larger entity, both in terms of substantive operations and number of employees.\n\n\n\nShare based listing expenses of $106.0 million represent non-cash IFRS 2 charges recorded in connection with the consummation of the SPAC merger.\n\nThe transaction is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 with an expense reflected for the difference between the fair value of the Ordinary Shares issued to NETC shareholders as compared to the fair value of NETC’s net assets or liabilities, as relevant, contributed. The fair value of the Vast Ordinary Shares was determined based on a quoted market price of $11.99 per Ordinary share at closing as of December 19, 2023.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued to NETC shareholders considers the impact of Ordinary Shares issuable to Legacy Vast shareholders (i.e. AgCentral Energy Pty Ltd and certain employees of Vast), upon the occurrence of certain Triggering Events or earlier, upon a change of control in accordance with the earnout provisions. Refer to note 14 – Reserves for further details.\n\nThe fair value of share consideration of $94.8 million and NETC’s net liabilities of $11.2 million result in an excess of the fair value of the shares issued over the value of the net monetary assets acquired of $106.0 million. The difference is reflected as a share based listing expense of $106.0 million for the services provided by NETC in connection with the listing. The fair value calculation of $94.8 million is based on the estimated fair value of Ordinary Shares issued to NETC shareholders in connection with the SPAC Merger, including an estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares for NETC of $22.6 million.\n\nThese condensed financial statements for the half-year ended December 31, 2023 give effect to the SPAC Merger and related transactions summarized below:\n\nOrdinary Shares issued in exchange for the following (in thousands):  \n---  \nNETC Class A Common Stock (b)| 805  \nBackstop Commitment Fee (f)| 350  \nNETC Class F Common Stock (b)| 3,000  \nAccelerated Earnback Shares (f)|  1,500  \nOrdinary Shares issued| 5,655  \nFair value of Vast shares issued in exchange for NETC shares valued at $11.99 per share| $| 67,799  \nVast Warrants issued in exchange for NETC warrants (c)| 4,129  \nShares issued as settlement of transaction expenses (e)| 307  \nFair value of earnout for NETC Sponsor (g, h)|  22,576  \nFair value of share consideration| 94,811  \nAdjusted NETC’s net liabilities upon closing (a)|  11,206  \nTotal| 106,017  \n  \n(a) the merger of NETC with and into Neptune Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Vast, with NETC surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vast.

CAG and Vast agreed that this commitment would be satisfied by CAG’s purchase of Class A common stock of NETC from existing NETC stockholders who previously elected to redeem their shares in connection with the SPAC Merger and whose redemption election would be reversed. The $7.0 million included in Cash has been reflected in Issued Capital of Vast upon consummation of the BCA; (e) the issuance of 171,569 Ordinary Shares to Guggenheim Securities as consideration for its services. A resulting loss of $0.3 million upon consummation of the BCA has been recorded within share based listing expenses; (f) the issuance of 1.5 million Ordinary Shares as Accelerated Earnback Shares pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement and issuance of 350,000 Ordinary Shares as Incremental Funding Commitment Fee pursuant to the October Notes Subscription Agreement.(g) During the Earnout Period, Vast may issue up to an aggregate of 2.4 million additional Ordinary Shares to NETC Sponsor in three equal tranches and up to an aggregate of 1.3 million Ordinary Shares to Legacy Vast shareholders in three equal tranches, upon the occurrence of each Triggering Event. Refer to note 14 – Reserves for further details.(h) Additionally, Vast may also issue 1.5 million Ordinary Shares to Legacy Vast shareholders upon receiving a notice to proceed under a contract for the procurement of a concentrated solar power plant at Port Augusta, in South Australia. Refer to note 14 – Reserves for further information.\n\nAlso included in the SPAC Merger, yet not forming part of the purchase consideration for the asset acquired are the following transactions:\n\n  * the entry into Equity Subscription Agreements and a Notes Subscription Agreement (including the October Notes Subscription Agreement) by Nabors Lux and AgCentral to purchase up to $15.0 million each ($30.0 million combined) of Ordinary Shares for $10.20 per share through the issuance of up to $5.0 million to AgCentral and $7.5 million to Nabors Lux ($12.5 million combined of Senior Convertible Notes from time to time beginning on the date of signing of the BCA and ending on the Closing date and $12.5 million to AgCentral and $10.0 million to Nabors Lux ($22.5 million combined) of committed subscriptions under the PIPE Financing funded on the Closing Date;\n  * the entry into the Nabors Backstop Agreement (as amended by the amendment to the Nabors Backstop Agreement dated December 7, 2023) by Nabors Lux to provide $10.0 million backstop to Vast to underwrite the potential investment by additional investors provided that the amount of the backstop be reduced dollar-for-dollar by (a) the balance of cash remaining in the Trust Account after giving effect to any redemptions of NETC Class A Common Stock by NETC public stockholders and (b) amounts invested by additional third parties (other than Nabors, AgCentral, CAG, EDF and their respective affiliates);\n  * the entry into the EDF Note Purchase Agreement to purchase a promissory note with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 10.0 million (equivalent to approximately $10.9 million on December 18, 2023);\n\n\n\nThe following summarized the number of Ordinary Shares issued upon closing of the BCA:\n\n**Shares outstanding upon closing of the BCA**  \n---  \n**Ownership in shares**| **%**  \nLegacy Vast shareholders| 20,499,999| 70.0| %  \nOther| 804,616| 2.7| %  \nNETC initial stockholders| 4,500,000| 15.4| %  \nShares issued to Nabors Lux and AgCentral in connection with financing transactions| 3,315,700| 11.3| %  \nShares issued as settlement of transaction expenses| 171,569| 0.6| %  \nTotal shares issued upon closing| 29,291,884| 100.0| %  \n  \n20. **Related party transactions**\n\na) **Parent entities**\n\n**Name**| **Type**| **Place of incorporation**| **Ownership interest**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**December 31, 2023**| **June 30, 2023**  \nAgCentral Energy Pty Ltd| Parent company| Australia|  67.2%| 100.0%  \n  \nb) **Subsidiaries**\n\n**Name**| **Type**| **Place of incorporation**| **Ownership interest**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**December 31, 2023**| **June 30,****2023**  \nNabors Transition Energy Corp Neptune Merger Sub, Inc.| SubsidiarySubsidiary| United StatesUnited States| 100%0%| 0%100%  \nNWQHPP Pty Ltd| Subsidiary| Australia| 100%| 100%  \nSolar Methanol 1 Pty Ltd| Subsidiary| Australia| 100%| 100%  \nVast Solar Aurora Pty Ltd| Subsidiary| Australia| 100%| 100%  \nVast Solar 1 Pty Ltd| Subsidiary| Australia| 100%| 100%  \nVast Solar Consulting Pty Ltd| Subsidiary| Australia| 100%| 100%  \nVast Employee Shareholdings Pty Ltd| Subsidiary| Australia| 100%| 0%  \nVast Intermediate HoldCo Pty Ltd| Subsidiary| Australia| 100%| 0%  \nVast Australia HoldCo Pty Ltd| Subsidiary| Australia| 100%| 0%  \nHyFuel Solar Refinery Pty Ltd| Subsidiary| Australia| 100%| 0%  \nVast Renewables HoldCo Corp| Subsidiary| United States| 100%| 0%  \nVast Renewables Management Services LLC| Subsidiary| United States| 100%| 0%  \nVast US Projects HoldCo Corp| Subsidiary| United States| 100%| 0%  \nEl Paso ProjectCo LLC| Subsidiary| United States| 100%| 0%  \n  \nc) **Transactions with other related parties**\n\nThe following transactions occurred with related parties:\n\n**For the Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n---  \n**2023**| **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nLease rental payments made to other related parties| 5| 21  \nLoan drawn down from parent entity – subsequently converted to Issued Capital upon consummation of the BCA| 12,500| 5,023  \nLoan drawn down from investors – subsequently converted to Issued Capital upon consummation of the BCA| 10,000| 14,718  \nGain on modification of borrowings recognised in the Capital Contribution Reserve| -| 3,652  \nGain on revaluation of derivative financial instruments| 170,376| (5| )  \nSettlement of all Convertibles Notes, Senior Convertible Notes and Loans from Shareholder upon consummation of the BCA| (226,373| )| -

This funding is a testament to the tremendous opportunity provided by Vast’s technology as well as our partners within the Solar Methanol Consortium.” \n\nPhilipp Kroepels, Director New Energy at Mabanaft reaffirms: \"With access to green methanol, our range of sustainable energy solutions for our customers continues to grow. The funding agreements make a crucial recognition and validation of our decarbonisation efforts and can make a strong contribution to strengthening Germany's leading role in the global energy transition.\" \n\nThe funding agreements are an important step forward for SM1, as well as the HyGATE program which seeks to support real-world pilot, trial, and demonstration projects along the hydrogen supply chain. Vast and Mabanaft are assessing SM1 with the Solar Methanol Consortium and are supported by fellow Australian technology company Calix as Principal CO2 Supply Partner and the Australian Solar Thermal Research Institute (ASTRI). \n\nMethanol is one of the most versatile hydrogen derivatives which, if produced using clean energy, has the potential to decarbonise several hard-to-abate industries, including shipping and aviation. SM1 will be powered by Vast’s CSP v3.0 technology, which aims to generate zero-emission heat and electricity to produce green methanol. CSP can provide an optimal balance of renewable heat and power, as required for the production of green fuels, and using the technology could potentially achieve a reduction of green fuel production costs of up to 40 per cent. \n\nSM1 aims to produce up to 7,500 tonnes per annum of green methanol and the Consortium has attracted the interest of major off-takers. The project aims to be a catalyst for a solar methanol industry in Australia, with the potential to export the fuel to Germany and other global markets, creating hundreds of highly skilled jobs. \n\n**About Vast**\n\nVast is a renewable energy company that has CSP systems to generate, store, and dispatch carbon-free, utility-scale electricity, industrial heat, and to enable the production of green fuels. Vast’s CSP v3.0 approach to CSP utilises a proprietary, modular sodium loop to efficiently capture and convert solar heat into these end products. \n\nOn December 19, 2023, Vast listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “VSTE”, while remaining headquartered in Australia. \n\nVisit [www.vast.energy](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vast.energy&esheet=53896353&newsitemid=20240214393273&lan=en-US&anchor=www.vast.energy&index=2&md5=c40a643083735d6d27d2f72cc471b6f8) for more information. \n\n**About Mabanaft**\n\nMabanaft is a leading independent and integrated energy company providing its customers with innovative energy solutions for their transportation, heating, industrial and agricultural needs.

In connection with the closing of Vast’s business combination, EDF Australia, a subsidiary of France’s EDF Group, which operates in more than 25 countries worldwide, executed on its capital commitment to Vast of a capital commitment of €10 million in conjunction with an agreement between the companies to partner on development of Australian CSP projects. In addition, Canberra Airport Group executed on its capital commitment valued at $9.2 million.\n\n“The support Vast has received from our strategic partners has been very meaningful to the progress of our company, both from a financial as well as operational standpoint,” said Craig Wood, CEO of Vast. “Canberra Airport Group and EDF Australia have shown their enthusiasm for CSP and their commitment to the clean energy transition through their commitments to Vast, with each bringing their own strategic imperatives to the partnerships with an eye to sustainable aviation fuel production and clean energy production. We are very excited to progress and expand our relationships with these two firms.”\n\nSubsequent to the end of the first half of the Company’s fiscal 2024, Vast announced the award of a total of up to approximately AUD $40.0 million in conditional funding agreements, in conjunction with the Company’s consortium partner, Mabanaft. As a result of the Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project’s selection for funding from the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (HyGATE), Vast will receive up to AUD $19.5 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), and Mabanaft is to receive up to €12.4 million from Projektträger Jülich on behalf of the German government. The funding relates to development of Vast’s Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project in Port Augusta, South Australia, which aims to produce green methanol through use of Vast’s CSP v3.0 technology.\n\n**Operational Events**\n\nDuring the first half of fiscal year 2024, Vast continued to make progress on its first utility-scale project for power generation, known as VS1, located in Port Augusta in South Australia.\n\nOn June 6, 2023 Vast announced the award to Worley Ltd. of contracts for basic engineering and front-end engineering and design (FEED) work for the VS1 project.\n\n“I am pleased by the progress on Vast’s VS1 project and excited by the partnership we have so far forged with Worley,” said Mr. Wood. “Bringing VS1 online using our CSP v3.0 technology will be a team effort, and we could not have selected a better teammate. Initial engineering on this first-of-its-kind project is crucial to its success, and we are confident in Worley’s approach. As VS1 moves forward through calendar 2024, we will look to further expand our world-class team.”\n\n**Key Hires and Board of Directors**\n\nOn August 23, 2023, Vast announced the hiring of Marshall D. (Mark) Smith as chief financial officer. Based between Vast’s Sydney headquarters and Houston, Texas, Mr. Smith brings more than 30 years of experience to the position, including energy industry expertise and leadership in operations, capital allocation, business development, and financial management. Most recently, he was CFO for a Texas-based privately held oil and gas company, having previously served as CFO for Guidon Energy, an oil and gas company that was Blackstone Energy Partners’ largest energy-focused investment. Mr. Smith also held executive positions at California Resources Corporation, Occidental Petroleum, Ultra Petroleum, and J.M. Huber Energy. Prior to that, he served as a Managing Director of Investment banking at Nesbitt Burns Securities (now BMO Capital Markets).\n\nOn September 9, 2023, the Company announced the hiring of Federico Sandoval as project director for the VS1 project. Mr. Sandoval brings a wealth of CSP expertise and a global track record of success to this role. His previous role as construction manager at Noor Energy in the UAE and his prior experiences with multiple CSP projects worldwide should make him an invaluable contributor to the Vast team and the delivery of VS1.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, the Company announced its complete seven-member board of directors. Vast’s board of directors is comprised of Chairman Peter Botten, an experienced energy executive, including over 26 years as managing director of Oil Search; Vast CEO Craig Wood; William Restrepo, chief financial officer of Nabors Industries Inc.; Colleen Calhoun, formerly of General Electric and Quaise Energy; Tom Quinn, an experienced energy and infrastructure executive with global experience; Colin Richardson, an experienced investment banker; and John Yearwood, an experienced board member and former CEO, President and COO of Smith International, Inc.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nFor the six months ending December 31, 2023 Vast reported total revenue of $768,000, compared to $547,000 for the same period in 2022. This included approximately $440,000 in revenue received in the form of grants and approximately $328,000 in revenue received from customers. The overall increase in revenue during the six months ending December 31, 2023 was related to (a) increased activity in relation to the design, engineering and project management services for a solar facility owned by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), and (b) higher estimated refundable Research & Development tax rebate recoveries due to higher spend incurred on eligible activities.\n\nDuring the period, Vast reported a net loss of ($281.5) million compared to a net loss of ($3.9) million during the previous year’s period. This is equal to diluted loss per share of ($66.44) for the six months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to diluted loss per share of ($1.83) for the same period in 2022. The increase in net loss was primarily related to non-cash accounting activities related to the close of the business combination, predominantly (a) share based listing expense recognized upon consummation of the business combination, amounting to $106.0 million, and (b) the loss realized recorded upon conversion of Convertible financial instruments previously issued by Vast, immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination, amounting to $170.4 million.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the Company had total available cash and equivalents of $16.5 million compared to $2.1 million on June 30, 2023. The Company reported total debt outstanding of $5.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $26.9 million as of June 30, 2023.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Vast had total diluted common shares outstanding of 29,291,884.\n\n**About Vast**\n\nVast is a renewable energy company that has CSP systems to generate, store, and dispatch carbon-free, utility-scale electricity and industrial heat, and to enable the production of green fuels.

Refer to note 19 - Capital reorganization (the “SPAC Merger”) for further details.\n\nThe accompanying notes form part of the consolidated financial statements\n\n**Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements**\n\n1. **General information**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise of Vast Renewables Limited (formerly Vast Solar Pty Ltd) and the entities it controls. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “Vast” mean Vast Renewables Limited and the entities it controls.\n\nVast is an Australian public company limited by shares incorporated on March 27, 2009. We are a leading renewable energy company that has developed concentrated solar power (CSP) systems to generate, store and dispatch carbon free, utility-scale electricity and industrial heat, and to enable the production of green fuels. Our unique approach to CSP utilizes a proprietary, modular sodium loop to efficiently capture and convert solar heat into these end products. Our vision is to provide continuous carbon-free energy globally by deploying our CSP technology and complementary technologies (e.g., intermittent solar PV and wind) to deliver renewable and dispatchable electricity, heat and storage on a continuous basis. We believe our CSP technology is capable of providing competitive, dispatchable and carbon-free power for on- and off-grid power generation applications, energy storage, process heat, and has the potential to unlock green fuels production.\n\nVast's registered office and principal place of business is as follows:\n\nLevel 7, Suite 02, 124 Walker Street  \n---  \nNorth Sydney  \nNSW 2060  \n  \nWith consummation of the SPAC Merger with Nabors Energy Transition Corp. (“NETC”) on December 18, 2023 (the “Closing Date”) as provided in note 19, this transaction is accounted for as a capital reorganization. The SPAC Merger, which is not within the scope of IFRS 3 as NETC does not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3, is accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2. As such, the SPAC Merger was achieved with the Company issuing shares to NETC shareholders in exchange for the net liabilities of NETC ($11.2 million) as of the Closing Date, accompanied by a share recapitalization. The net liabilities of NETC are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Any excess of the fair value of the Company’s shares issued considering a fair value of the Vast Ordinary Shares of $11.99 per share (price of Vast Ordinary Shares at the Closing Date) over the fair value of NETC’s identifiable net liabilities acquired represents compensation for the service of a share exchange listing for its shares and is expensed as incurred (“share based listing expense”) and further details of share based listing expense is provided in note 19.\n\nAs a result of the SPAC Merger, NETC became a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company. On December 19, 2023, the Ordinary Shares and public Vast Warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, or “Nasdaq,” under the symbols “VSTE” and “VSTEW,” respectively.\n\nThe following table provides information relating to our directors and executive officers as of the date of approving these condensed financial statements.\n\n**Name**| **Age**| **Position**  \n---|---|---  \nCraig Wood| 46| Chief Executive Officer and Director  \nMarshall (Mark) D.

These financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), as applicable to interim financial reporting.\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Therefore, these financial statements should be read together with the annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the Company’s 2023 annual financial statements, except as disclosed below in note 1 (c).\n\nFunctional and presentation currency\n\nThe functional currency of Vast is Australian dollars (“AUD”) being the primary economic environment in which it operates. The presentation currency of Vast is United States (“US” or “$”) dollars. b) **Going concern**\n\nVast incurred a net loss of $281.5 million and $3.9 million for the half-years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively and used net cash in operating activities of $28.0 million and $2.8 million for the half-years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net current assets of $7.1 million and total net assets of $2.2 million. As of December 31, 2023, promissory notes totalling $5.4 million held by EDF were outstanding and included in the Company’s liabilities.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Vast issued an additional 681,620 Ordinary Shares to Nabors Lux 2 S.a.r.l (“Nabors”) for a consideration of $7.0 million pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement, as contemplated in the Business Combinations Agreement (“BCA”). In addition, under the BCA, Nabors granted Vast a term loan in the form of the Backstop Loan Agreement in an amount of up to $5.0 million which Vast expects to draw upon within the next 12 months. \n\nThe Company is forecasting that it will continue to incur significant operating cash outflows to fund the contracting, construction and commissioning of its current projects and to meet all of its obligations, including interest and principal payments on the outstanding debt. In particular, the development and delivery of projects “VS1” (a 30 MW / 288 MWh reference CSP plant located in Port Augusta, South Australia) and “SM1” (a 20 ton per day solar methanol demonstration facility that will be co-located with and partially powered by VS1) will require substantial funding. These projects are expected to rely on outside sources of financing. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) has announced funding of up to AUD 65 million on February 13, 2023 for VS1. On January 27, 2023, ARENA also announced that Vast will receive up to AUD 19.5 million from ARENA and Vast’s consortium partner, Mabanaft will receive up to EUR 12.4 million from Projektträger Jülich on behalf of the German government for SM1, in each case as part of the HyGATE Program. The funding awards for VS1 and SM1 are each subject to multiple conditions precedent, including but not limited to the ability to provide sufficient equity to meet the balance of funding requirements for the projects, the projects achieving financial close prior to specified dates and securing relevant permitting and approvals such as a grid connection. In addition, the Australian Federal government has announced financial support for the development of VS1 of up to AUD 110 million, the terms and conditions of which (including, inter alia, achievement of financial close of VS1 by a specified date) are to be negotiated with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water and approved by the Australian Federal Government.\n\nVast intends to raise additional funding through an external capital raise commencing early in the financial year ending June 30, 2025. Vast’s ability to pursue its growth strategy and to continue as a going concern is principally dependent on the ability of the Company to meet its cash flow forecasts and to raise additional funding as and when necessary. \n\nAs a result of the above, there is material uncertainty related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt (or raise substantial doubt as contemplated by PCAOB standards) on Vast’s ability to continue as a going concern, and therefore, that the Company may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nc) **Application of new and amended accounting standards adopted by the group**\n\nA number of amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amended standards.\n\n3. **Revenue from customers**\n\n**Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n---  \n**2023**| **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nConsulting fees| $| 326| $| 146  \nMargin fees| 2| 62  \n$| 328| $| 208  \n  \n**_Consulting fees_**\n\nRevenue from consulting fees is recognised predominantly in relation to the design, engineering and project management services for a solar facility owned by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), based on the actual services provided to them at the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. Revenue is recognised over time as the customer receives and uses the benefits from consulting services simultaneously. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total expected labour hours for each project or contract.\n\nEstimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenue or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the change become known by management.\n\nIn the case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered by Vast exceed the payment, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognised.\n\n**_Margin fees_**\n\nIn relation to the facility mentioned above, Vast is charging a margin fee in the form of 10% administration and handling fee for the procurement of equipment, components, and materials on behalf of CSIRO. The Company recognises revenue from procurement service at a point in time when goods are acquired and are presented net of relevant gross receipts and gross payments.\n\n4. **Grant revenue**\n\n**_Research and Development tax incentives_** In order to encourage the industry to invest more in R&D, the Australian government offers a tax incentive that reduces the Company’s R&D costs by offering tax offsets for eligible R&D expenditure. Under the R&D Tax Incentive, Vast is eligible to receive a refundable R&D tax offset in respect of its eligible R&D expenditure.\n\n**_R &D tax incentives _**  \n---  \n**Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n**2023**| **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nRefundable R&D tax offset for the half-year| $| 440| $| 339  \nR&D Tax credit recoveries recognised as grant income| $| 440| $| 339  \n  \n5. **Expenses**\n\nNet loss includes the following expenses:\n\n**Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n---  \n**2023**| **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n_Administrative and other expenses:_  \nShare based payment expenses (1)| $| 750| $| -  \nLegal and accounting expenses| 3,781| 1,050  \nOther expenses| 954| 268  \n$| 5,485| $| 1,318  \n _Gain/loss on derivative financial instruments:_  \nRealised loss on Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 4, and Senior Convertible Notes issued to AgCentral (2)| $| 170,376| $| -  \nUnrealised gain on Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 4, and Senior Convertible Notes issued to AgCentral| -| (5| )  \nUnrealised gain on Promissory Note issued to EDF  (2) | (4,666| )| -  \nUnrealised gain on NETC Warrants  (2) | (1,414| )| -  \n$| 164,296| $| (5| )  \n  \n(1) Refer to note 14 – Reserves for more details relating to share based payment expenses.(2) Refer to note 16 – Financial Instruments – Fair values and financial risk management for further details.\n\n_Finance costs:_  \n---  \nInterest expense on Convertible Note 3 – AgCentral| $| 431| $| 449  \nInterest expense on Convertible Note 4 – AgCentral| 506| 459  \nInterest expense on Convertible Note 5 – AgCentral| 58| 61  \nInterest expense on Senior Convertible Notes – AgCentral & Nabors| 309| -  \nInterest expense on Loans from shareholders – AgCentral| 159| 118  \nInterest expense on Promissory Note – EDF| 43| -  \nOther| 3| 67  \n$| 1,509| $| 1,154  \n  \n6. **Income tax expense**\n\nThe standard rate of corporations’ tax applied to taxable profit is 25% for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Vast has unused tax losses of $6.2 million for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised for the unused tax losses as they are not likely to generate taxable income in the foreseeable future. Income tax expense is recognised based on management’s estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year. As management has determined that the recognition criteria associated with Deferred Tax Assets, including Deferred Tax Assets arising from unused losses is not satisfied, whereby it must be probable that future taxable profits will arise, no income tax expense has been recorded and therefore there is no effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nDuring the half-year ended December 31, 2023, as part of the BCA, Vast entered into a Noteholder Support and Loan Termination Agreement whereby each of the convertible promissory notes held by AgCentral Energy were discharged and terminated in exchange for Vast shares, as repayment of all the principal outstanding and accrued interest immediately prior to the BCA. As such requirements of the Commercial Debt Forgiveness provisions of the income tax legislation applied, and a gain on forgiveness arose where the market value of the commercial debt amount released was greater than the market value of the shares issued. The net forgiven amount upon consummation of the BCA was $17.1 million. The gain on forgiveness was applied to reduce the tax losses brought forward as at June 30, 2023, certain expenditure amounts incurred in previous income years, and the cost base of certain Capital Gains Tax assets.\n\n**7.****Trade and other receivables**\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nTrade receivables| 624| 4  \nGoods and Service Tax receivable| 170| 204  \nOther receivables| 171| 106  \n965| 314  \n  \n**8.****Prepaid expenses**\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nPrepaid insurance| 2,566| 29  \nOther prepaid expenses| 24| 15  \n2,590| 44  \n  \nAs at December 31, 2023, the balance of prepaid insurance is predominantly made of the one year cover for Directors and Officers, effective from the date of the SPAC Merger.\n\n**9.****Trade and other payables**\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nTrade payables| 5,207| 1,265  \nAccrued expenses| 3,994| 4,280  \nOther payables| 210| 79  \n9,411| 5,624  \n  \nTrade payables and accrued expenses as at December 31, 2023 are predominantly made of business combination related consulting and advice costs, and an accrual for excise tax ($2.9 million) to reflect the cash payment of the U.S. Federal Government Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 1% excise tax for the repurchases of stock. The Inflation Reduction Act imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after December 31, 2022. As at December 31, 2022, trade payables and accrued expenses were predominantly made of consulting, legal and consulting fees payable or accrued.\n\n**10.****Warrants liability**\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nWarrants liability| 2,767| -  \n2,767| -  \n  \nVast Warrants exchanged in lieu of NETC Warrants consist of 27,529,987 potential ordinary shares, made of: (i) 13,799,987 Ordinary Shares that are issuable by us upon the exercise of 13,799,987 Public Warrants, and (ii) 13,730,000 Ordinary Shares that are issuable by us upon the exercise of 13,730,000 Private Warrants. Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, with substantially the same terms as those of the NETC Warrant Agreements.\n\n  * NETC Warrants Issuance date: November 16, 2021, transferred to Vast on December 18, 2023\n  * Maturity date: 5 years from the date of consummation of the BCA\n  * Exercisable: at any time after 30 days from the date of consummation of the BCA\n  * Private Warrants may not be sold or transferred for 30 days from the date of consummation of the BCA\n  * Public Warrants may be redeemed by the issuer at a nominal price if the stock price, when the Warrant is exercisable, reaches a threshold price for 20 out of 30 consecutive days as follows: \n    * Redemption price: $0.01\n    * Threshold price: $18.00\n\n\n\nEffective upon consummation of the BCA,\n\n  * each Vast Warrant is exercisable solely for Vast Ordinary Shares;\n  * the number of Vast Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise of each Vast Warrant is equal to the number of shares of NETC Class A Common Stock issued upon exercise of the applicable NETC Warrant;\n  * the per share exercise price for the Vast Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such Vast Warrant is equal to the per share exercise price for the shares of NETC Class A Common Stock subject to the applicable NETC Warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the consummation of the BCA.\n\n\n\nBoth Public and Private Warrants are accounted for as liabilities under IFRS 9 following consummation of the BCA and valued at the Public Warrants trading price. Accordingly, they will be subject to ongoing mark-to-market adjustments through the statement of profit or loss.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the fair value of Private and Public Warrants has been determined as the quoted price of $0.10.\n\n**11.****Borrowings**\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**Current**| **Non-current**| **Current**| **Non-current**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nConvertible Notes – AgCentral| -| -| 14,281| -  \nSenior Convertible Notes - AgCentral and Nabors Lux| -| -| -| 7,134  \nShareholder Loan – AgCentral| -| -| 5,531| -  \nPromissory Note – EDF| -| 5,404| -| -  \n-| 5,404| 19,812| 7,134  \n  \n**a)****Promissory Note – EDF**\n\nOn December 19, 2023, Vast Intermediate HoldCo Pty Ltd (HoldCo) issued a Promissory Note to EDF Australia Pacific Pty Ltd (EDF). The key contractual terms of the Promissory Note have been summarised below:\n\n  1. The Noteholder is EDF Australia Pacific Pty Ltd.\n  2. The Promissory Note has a Face Value equivalent to EURO 10,000,000 converted into US $10,831,953 at the USD:EUR exchange rate on Bloomberg on the Closing Date.\n  3. The Promissory Note will accrue interest at 3% per annum. Interest accrues daily on the daily balance of the Outstanding Principal Amount.\n  4. The Promissory Note has a term of 5 years from the date of issuance; however the Maturity Date may be extended for a period of 2 years at HoldCo’s option by written notice to EDF. On written notice from HoldCo, EDF must extend.\n  5. EDF has the right to exchange all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount and interest on the Promissory Note at an exchange rate of US $10.20 per share for a period of 5 years (7 years, if extended) following closing. Any partial exchange cannot be less than US$2,000,000. The exchange is conditional on satisfaction of an exchange condition being, EDF has invested at least US$20,000,000 in the project entity of a CSP Project. The project entity of a CSP Project pertains to the standalone entity incorporated for the purpose of developing the CSP project. EDF can elect an amount up to 75% of its equity contribution to the project entity. The remaining portion is Vast's contribution. A separate Joint Venture agreement will also be entered into for each approved CSP project. This is governed by the ‘Joint Development Agreement’ entered into between Vast Parent and EDF in connection with the ‘Note Purchase Agreement’. Please refer to note 17 - Contingent assets, liabilities & commitment for further discussion on the Joint Development Agreement.\n  6. New investment clause: \n    1. If Vast enters into an agreement with certain parties, pursuant to which these parties will pay or contribute funds to Vast, the terms of the agreement in respect to security or priority; duration; or interest rate should not be more favourable than that of the Promissory Note. If the terms are more favourable, then the terms to the agreement will be automatically amended to match such other parties’ terms.\n    2. If Vast enters into an agreement to raise capital from third party strategic investors through a privately negotiated transaction and any such funds are used to repay the Nabors Backstop then the terms should be no less favourable than the terms of the Promissory Note. If so, the terms of the Promissory Note shall be automatically amended.\n\n\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, management has evaluated that HoldCo remains in compliance with all covenants, financial (including a prohibition on the declaration or payment of dividends) and non-financial, with respect to the EDF Promissory Note such that non-current classification of the liability is appropriate on the Condensed Statement of Financial Position.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Vast has evaluated its issuance of the note to determine if the components qualify as derivatives requiring separate recognition in its financial statements. The Company has determined the New investment clause, conversion and interest settlement features at the option of noteholder, to be an ‘embedded derivative’ requiring recognition separate from the borrowings. After the recognition of the embedded derivative, the Company recognises the promissory note at amortised cost, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis over the tenure of the note.\n\nThe result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is revalued at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability, and the change in fair value during the reporting period is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The current or non-current classification of derivative instruments is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe embedded derivative as part of such contracts have been tabulated below:\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**Component**| **Particulars**| **2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nEmbedded derivative| Promissory Note – EDF| 950| -  \n950| -  \n  \nOn issuance date, the Embedded derivative liability was recognised for $5.5 million. The Company’s closing share price on the first day of trading, i.e. $11.99 was used, being the closest observable market price to the valuation date. As at December 31, 2023 the valuation of the instrument was measured at $1.0 million, the reduction being predominantly driven by the significant decrease in the Company’s share price during the period since issuance ($5.19 as at December 31, 2023). The conversion option was measured at fair value through profit or loss, driving an unrealised gain of $4.5 million during the period ended December 31, 2023.

The Noteholder is AgCentral Energy Pty Ltd, the parent entity of Vast.\n  2. The Noteholder can elect to convert any or all outstanding convertible notes into ordinary shares by providing written notice to Vast. Each outstanding note can be converted into one ordinary share (‘conversion’).\n  3. Coupon interest is payable at the rate of 8% per annum on the principal outstanding. Interest accrues daily and is payable every six months.\n  4. Within the first 18 months of issuance, Vast has the option to settle interest payments in cash or by issuance of additional convertible notes. After the first 18 months, the Noteholder has the option to choose settlement of interest by payment in cash or by issuance of additional convertible notes (‘interest settlement’). As of June 30, 2023, there has been no conversion election from the Noteholder. Refer to note 13 – Issued capital for details on conversion of these notes upon consummation of the BCA.\n  5. The latest modified maturity date of all convertible notes was October 31, 2021 prior to the extensions noted below.\n\n\n\nOn June 25, 2021, Vast received an interest waiver from the noteholder, where interest was forgiven from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 on all convertible notes along with a revised maturity date of December 31, 2022. On May 24, 2022, Vast received another interest waiver, where interest was forgiven from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 on all convertible notes, along with a revised maturity date of December 31, 2023. Further, on June 30, 2023, Vast received another interest waiver, where interest on Convertible notes 3, 4 and 5 was forgiven from January 1, 2023 to the earlier of the effective date of the BCA and December 31, 2023.\n\nSenior Convertible Notes issued by Vast were subjected to the following terms:\n\n  1. The Noteholder of Tranche 2 is AgCentral Energy Pty Ltd, the parent entity of Vast. The Noteholder of Tranches 1 and 3 is Nabors Lux 2 S.a.r.l.\n  2. The Senior Convertible Notes will accrue interest at 4% per annum, ceasing when the Senior Convertible Notes are either redeemed or converted into ordinary shares. Interest is payable six months in arrears. The Company may, at its discretion (but with notice to the Noteholders), pay interest in cash or capitalise interest to the principal amount outstanding for each Senior Convertible Note.\n  3. If the Company undergoes a business combination, the Senior Convertible Notes will mandatorily be converted to ordinary shares in this instance, with the conversion price based on the market price of shares at a 25% discount.\n  4. If the Company undergoes a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (“SPAC”) transaction, the Senior Convertible Notes will mandatorily be converted to ordinary shares in this instance, with the conversion price fixed at $10.20. Refer to note 13 – Issued capital for details on conversion of these notes upon consummation of the BCA.\n  5. If the Company undergoes an event of default or change of control, the Noteholders may choose to either redeem the Senior Convertible Notes for cash or convert them into ordinary shares. In a conversion event, the conversion price will be based on the market price of shares at a 25% discount.\n  6. The conversion of the notes is at the discretion of Vast (other than in a scenario where conversion is mandated), if they are held to maturity. Each Senior Convertible Note has a term of 18 months from the date of issuance.\n\n\n\nUp to the consummation of the BCA, Vast has evaluated its issuance of each convertible note, including Senior Convertible Notes, to determine if the components qualify as derivatives requiring separate recognition in its financial statements. The Company has determined the conversion and interest settlement features at the option of noteholder, to be an ‘embedded derivative’ requiring recognition separate from the borrowings. After the recognition of the embedded derivative, the Company recognises the convertible notes at amortised cost, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis over the tenure of convertible notes.\n\nThe result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is revalued at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability, and the change in fair value during the reporting period is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The current or non-current classification of derivative instruments is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.

Vast acquired 50% of the shares in SiliconAurora on June 15, 2022 from 14D for consideration of $0.07 million as an initial payment and $1.58 million as deferred consideration. The deferred consideration of $0.62 million was paid in July 2022 from the short term loan obtained from Vast’s shareholder and the remainder of $0.96 million is expected to be paid by October 31, 2024, subject to the joint venture receiving a written offer/ notice to connect from the relevant network service provider. The Company intends to undertake fundraising activities. The funds raised from those activities are intended to be used to settle the acquisition of SiliconAurora by repaying the remaining component of deferred consideration and fund Vast's on-going operational expenditure.\n\nSiliconAurora Pty Ltd will be “the legal and beneficial owner” of all the existing assets comprising the project.

They have been recognised as an incremental share based payment upon consummation of the BCA under IFRS 2. Refer to note 19 – Capital reorganization (the “SPAC Merger”) for further details on the share based listing expense.\n\nThe fair value of the Earnouts has been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the pay-off based on contractual terms using the following key inputs:\n\n  * underlying asset value: a range of value between AUD $1 million to AUD $4 million\n  * closing stock price at valuation date: $11.99\n  * price volatility of the company’s shares, based on guideline companies adjusted for size and leverage: 25%\n  * discounted at the term-matched risk free rate: 3.90%\n\n\n\n_Earnout for Legacy Vast shareholder issuable to AgCentral:_\n\nIn addition, upon the occurrence of Triggering Events I, II, and III discussed above, and of Triggering Event IV” meaning the date on which a notice to proceed is issued under a contract in respect of the procurement of a 30MW/288MWhr concentrated solar power project at Port Augusta in South Australia, 2,799,999 Ordinary Shares are issuable to AgCentral pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement.\n\nThe quoted market price of Vast shares that was used to determine the cost of listing is presumed to include an adjustment for these earnout shares. As a consequence, the fair value of the earnout shares issuable to Legacy Vast shareholders is are already factored into the cost of listing and a separate adjustment was not considered necessary.\n\n**MEP shares (equity settled):**\n\nThe purpose of the Management Equity Plan (“MEP”) was to provide medium to long term incentive to eligible employees and contractors of Vast by having a plan pool limit of 100 shares. 80 shares were issued during the year ended June 30, 2021 at a fair value of AUD $70 per share, with eligible employees and contractors paying cash of AUD $10 per share in addition to providing services to the Company in exchange for those shares. As the shares did not have any vesting conditions, the excess of the grant date fair value of the shares and the amount paid by the employees was therefore recognised as share-based payment expense in full at the time of the grant of the shares. The shares did not carry any voting rights nor rights to any dividends or other distributions. Following the occurrence of a liquidity event as defined in the MEP Deed or as otherwise defined by the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”), the Board in its discretion could allow MEP shareholders an entitlement linked to the exit price in form of cash or conversion to ordinary shares from such an event. As per the MEP Deed, management’s share is 25% of exit proceeds where the sale price is AUD$10 million or less, or 33.33% where it is above AUD$10 million. Vast had historically accounted for the share-based payment as an equity-settled scheme, as Vast had determined that it did not have a present obligation to settle the share-based payment in cash.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, Vast, AgCentral Energy and the participants to the MEP entered into a MEP De-SPAC Side Deed and Amendment to the MEP Deed to clarify a suitable mechanism for MEP participants to realise the economic benefit of their MEP Shares. The key modification terms of the MEP De-SPAC Side Deed and Amendment to the MEP Deed include the introduction of a vesting period and ‘Agreed Fixed Deductions’ to be used in allocation of profits on completion of the BCA. The modification of the terms and conditions of the MEP did not increase the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement and was not beneficial to the MEP participants. As a result, there was no additional expense recognised.\n\nThe MEP shares meet the definition of a share-based payment arrangement as eligible employees and contractors will receive equity instruments in exchange for services provided to the Company, with a partial cash subscription payment. Accordingly, MEP shares are recognised at their grant date fair values of AUD $70 per share, with the difference between cash proceeds received (AUD $10 per share) and the fair value of MEP shares recognised within the share-based payment reserve.\n\nIn addition, immediately prior to the consummation of the BCA, 5 MEP shares were cancelled on December 18, 2023.\n\nUpon consummation of the BCA, the 75 MEP shares issued to eligible employees and contractors of Vast were converted into 2,036,900 Ordinary Shares, forming part of the Legacy Vast issued capital. The 75 MEP shares converted at a rate of 26,453 Vast Ordinary Shares per MEP, with 5 MEP shares receiving an additional 10,581 Vast Ordinary Shares per MEP share. The additional value allocated to these shares were recognised at fair value and expensed immediately through profit or loss within share based payment expense for USD 0.6 million (refer to note 5 – Expenses).\n\n**Shares issued under the Employee share plan for the benefit of participants in Vast’s Equity Remuneration Schemes (equity settled):**\n\nOn December 18, 2023, 264,533 Ordinary Shares were granted to certain employees of Vast and issued to an employee share trust until such time they are vested, out of the previous MEP share pool, which had not been previously granted to any employees prior to the BCA. Vast consolidates the trust. These shares are treated as treasury shares with Nil carrying value as at December 31, 2023. Those shares were issued by Vast at the discretion of AgCentral. As such, Vast made a grant of share based payment to employees, including key management personnel. Refer to note 20 – Related Party transactions for further details.\n\nThe employee shares have the following key terms and conditions attached to them:\n\n  * For the purposes the IFRS 2 charge the fair value at grant date was calculated using $11.99 per share\n  * Vesting Conditions: The shares will vest on expiry of the Disposal Restriction Period.\n  * Service Conditions: The employees have to still be employed on expiry of the Disposal Restriction Period.\n  * Disposal Restriction Period: The shares will be subject to a total restriction on disposal for a period of 12 months commencing on the issue of the shares.\n  * Shares will be held on trust by Vast Employee Share Holdings Pty Ltd as trustee for the Vast Employee Share Trust.\n\n\n\nThese shares have vesting conditions attached to them and therefore a share based payment expense was recorded under IFRS 2 at fair value through profit or loss for USD 0.1 million (refer to note 5 – Expenses).\n\n_Movement in foreign currency translation reserve is as follows:_\n\n**2023**| **2022**  \n---|---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nAs of July 1| 3,285| 2,394  \nMovement during the year| (241| )| 232  \nAs of December 31| 3,044| 2,626  \n  \nTo the extent that the amount recognised in the FCTR arose as a consequence of translating the company's financial statements into the USD presentation currency, these amounts will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n_Movement in capital contribution reserve is as follows:_\n\n**2023**| **2022**  \n---|---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nAs of July 1| 4,591| 3,452  \nInterest forgiveness on convertible notes and shareholder loan| -| 267  \nDerecognition upon consummation of the BCA| (4,591| )| -  \nDeferred tax impact| -| (67| )  \nAs of December 31| -| 3,652  \nThe capital contribution reserve represents the modification adjustment from loan from shareholder and convertible note issued to AgCentral Energy Pty Ltd (Noteholder). The Noteholder agreed to changes to the terms and conditions, which included interest waivers and term extensions as outlined in Note 11 - Borrowings, in their capacity as the shareholder of the entity. The gains arising as a result of the changes to the terms and conditions were therefore recognised directly in equity as a contribution in their capacity as owner. Modification adjustments presented are never reclassified to profit or loss. The balance in the reserve was derecognised against Issued Capital upon the consummation of the BCA and derecognition of the convertible notes.  \n  \n15. **Accumulated losses**\n\n_Movements in accumulated losses were as follows:_\n\n**2023**| **2022**  \n---|---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nAs of July 1| (39,649| )| (24,432| )  \nLoss during the half-year| (281,486| )| (3,937| )  \nAs of December 31| (321,135| )| (28,369| )  \n  \n16. **Financial Instruments – Fair values and financial risk management**\n\nThis note explains Vast’s accounting classifications and fair values including its exposure to financial risks and how these risks could affect Vast’s future financial performance. Current year profit or loss information has been included where relevant to add further context.\n\n**(a) Accounting classifications and fair values**\n\nThe following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial liabilities, including the ones accounted for in Reserves, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value.\n\n**December 31,**  \n---  \n**2023**| **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \nWarrants liability designated at fair value – Level 1 hierarchy (1)| 2,767| -  \nNETC Earnouts designated at fair value – Level 3 hierarchy (2)| 22,576| -  \nDerivative financial instrument designated at fair value associated with EDF Promissory Note – Level 3 hierarchy (3)| 950| -  \nDerivative financial instrument designated at fair value associated with Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 5 and Senior Convertible Notes – Level 3 hierarchy (4)| -| 27  \n  \n(1) Refer to note 10 – Warrants liability for key valuation inputs applied to these warrants.\n\n(2) Refer to note 14 – Reserves for key valuation inputs applied to these earnouts.

A 10% increase in the risk-free rate assumption would not result in a material change in fair value of the derivative financial instrument as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n(4) The following table shows the valuation technique used in measuring level 3 fair values for derivative financial instruments measured at fair value associated with Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 5 and Senior Convertible Notes as well as significant unobservable inputs used:\n\n**Type**| **Valuation technique**| **Significant unobservable inputs**  \n---|---|---  \nDerivative financial instrument designated at fair value – Level 3 hierarchy| Derivative valuations have been determined by a Black-Scholes formula adjusted for dilution| Risk free rate: not applicable (2022: 3.90%)Volatility: not applicable (2022: 40%)  \n  \n**Reconciliation of level 3 fair values**\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for Level 3 fair values.\n\n**Movements in derivative financial instruments**| **(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n---|---  \nOpening balance as of July 1, 2023| 192  \nAdditions – Embedded derivative associated to EDF Promissory Note| 5,616  \nAdditions – Embedded derivative associated to Senior Convertible Notes| 288  \nFair value changes recognised as unrealised loss in profit or loss – Embedded derivative associated with EDF Promissory Note| (4,666| )  \nFair value changes recognised as realised loss in profit or loss – Embedded derivative associated with Senior Convertible Notes| 2,334  \nFair value changes recognised as realised loss in profit or loss – Embedded derivative associated with Convertible Notes 3,4 and 5| 168,042  \nConversion to Issued Capital upon consummation of the BCA - Embedded derivatives associated with Convertible Notes 3,4 and 5 and Senior Convertible Notes| (170,856| )  \nClosing balance as of December 31, 2023| 950  \nOpening balance as of July 1, 2022| 32  \nFair value changes recognised as unrealised gain in profit or loss| (5| )  \nClosing balance as of December 31, 2022| 27  \n  \nFair value changes recognised as realised losses reflect the mark to market valuation for the embedded derivative related to the Existing Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 5, and Senior Convertible Notes for the period from July 1, 2023 to December 18, 2023. The valuation of these instruments immediately prior to the close of the business combination arrangement have utilised a share price of $11.99 as the spot price, being Vast’s closing stock price on December 19, 2023. Derivative valuations have been determined by a Black-Scholes formula adjusted for dilution. Volatility of 40% has been applied as at December 18, 2023 against all tranches. Risk free rates of 5.63% (Convertible Notes 3, 4 and 5) and of 5.15% (Senior Convertible Notes) have been applied as at December 18, 2023.\n\n**(b) Market risk**\n\n**_(i) Foreign exchange risk_** Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not Vast’s functional currency i.e. AUD.\n\n_Exposure_\n\nVast’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in EUR and USD are as follows:\n\n**December 31,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2023**  \n**(In thousands)**  \n**Trade payables**  \nEUR| 81| 17  \nUSD| 2,296| 66  \n  \n_Amounts recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive income:_ During the year, the following foreign exchange related amounts were recognised in profit or loss:\n\n**Six Months Ended December 31,**  \n---  \n**2023** | **2022**  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n**Amounts recognised in profit or loss**  \nUnrealised Currency Gain/(Loss)| 58| -  \nRealised Currency Gain/(Loss)| (56| )| (8| )  \n2| (8| )  \n  \nGiven the limited exposure, Vast manages its foreign exchange risk exposure by monitoring exchange rates at regular intervals before making an informed decision to transact in such currencies.\n\n**(c) Credit risk**\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to Vast if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations arising principally from Vast’s receivables from customers. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents as well as credit exposures from customers, including outstanding receivables. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.\n\n_Trade receivables_ Vast’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer which are primarily government organisation and joint operator. Vast applies IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. Management believes that Vast's overall exposure to credit risk from Trade receivables to be not material.\n\n_Cash and cash equivalents_ Vast held cash and cash equivalents of $16.5 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties, which are rated AA- based on Standard and Poor’s ratings. Management believes that Vast's overall exposure to credit risk from cash and cash equivalents to be not material.\n\n**(d) Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Vast will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Vast’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to Vast’s reputation.\n\nVast’s exposure to Liquidity risk primarily pertains to promissory notes issued to EDF. Coupon interest is payable at the rate of 3% per annum on the principal outstanding while interest accrues daily and is capitalised and payable at maturity (i.e. December 14, 2028).\n\nDuring the six months ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into the Nabors Backstop Agreement (as amended by the amendment to the Nabors Backstop Agreement dated December 7, 2023) whereby Nabors Lux is to provide $10.0 million backstop to Vast to underwrite the potential investment by additional investors provided that the amount of the backstop be reduced dollar-for-dollar by (a) the balance of cash remaining in the Trust Account after giving effect to any redemptions of NETC Class A Common Stock by NETC public stockholders and (b) amounts invested by additional third parties (other than Nabors, AgCentral, CAG, EDF and their respective affiliates).\n\nDuring the six months ended December 31, 2023, as part of the BCA, Vast entered into a Noteholder Support and Loan Termination Agreement whereby each of the convertible notes held by AgCentral Energy were discharged and terminated in exchange for Vast shares, as repayment of all the principal outstanding and accrued interest immediately prior to the de-SPAC process.\n\n**As of December 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n**Carrying amount**| **Total contractual cash flows**| **2 months or less**| **3-36 months**| **Beyond 36 months**  \nPromissory Note| (5,404| )| 12,457| -| -| (12,457| )  \nDeferred consideration| (976| )| 1,026| -| (1,026| )| -  \nTrade Payables| (9,411| )| 9,411| (9,411| )| -| -  \nWarrants liability| (2,767| )| -| -| (2,767| )| -  \nLease liabilities| (36| )| 36| (7| )| (29| )| -  \nTotal non-derivatives| (18,594| )| 22,930| (9,418| )| (3,822| )|  (12,457| )  \n**As of June 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**(In thousands of US Dollars)**  \n**Carrying amount**| **Total contractual cash flows**| **2 months or less**| **3-36 months**| **Beyond 36 months**  \nConvertible notes| (21,415| )| 21,708| -| (21,708| )| -  \nLoan from shareholder| (5,531| )| 5,704| -| (5,704| )| -  \nDeferred consideration| (955| )| 995| -| (995| )| -  \nTrade Payables| (5,624| )| 5,624| (5,624| )| -| -  \nLease liabilities| (54| )| 57| (7| )| (50| )| -  \nTotal non-derivatives| (33,579| )| 34,088| (5,631| )| (28,457| )| -  \nDerivative financial instruments| (192| )| 192| -| (192| )| -  \n  \nIn order to manage its liquidity, whilst the management has secured a level of additional funding, in order to fund the operating cash flows and maintain these minimum liquidity reserve levels, it is likely that additional working capital funding will be required. If Vast is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations and reducing overhead expenses.\n\n17. **Contingent assets, liabilities & commitment**\n\n1) In 2021, the Company received contributions from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in relation to funding a 30 MW concentrated solar thermal power reference plant variation contract (variation funding agreement). In relation to the funding agreement, the arrangement includes a clause on change of control, which indicated that if the Company failed to get funding to build the facility in Australia by May 31, 2024 but obtains finance for an offshore facility before that period, it would give rise to the requirement to repay a proportion of funding received from ARENA. At reporting date and upon entering into BCA, the Company did not identify such circumstances, as significant progress has been made on this facility in Australia. Furthermore, the funding agreement, and hence any contingent liability associated with it, was terminated on August 16, 2023. Refer to note 2 (b) – Going concern for further details regarding the Company’s funding requirements.\n\n2) On December 7, 2023, the Company entered into a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) with EDF, pursuant to which :\n\n  1. the Company and EDF will co-develop CSP Projects on an exclusive basis, subject to certain preexisting exceptions, in (i) Australia and, (ii) subject to certain conditions relating to expanding this exclusivity, other jurisdictions,\n  2. EDF will be provided with a right to elect to invest equity in CSP Projects which become Approved Projects and\n  3. the Company will have the right to be the exclusive supplier of CSP Technology to all Potential Eligible Projects, Eligible Projects and Approved Projects.\n\n\n\nPursuant to the EDF JDA, the parties have agreed to collaborate on certain development activities with respect to CSP Projects. The Company and EDF will establish a steering committee, composed of two appointees from each party, to oversee and govern the activities of the EDF JDA. Costs with respect to Eligible Projects developed under the EDF JDA will be borne by the parties equally. The EDF JDA also specifies that a joint venture agreement (“JVA”) will be entered into for each jointly developed project which reaches a certain stage of development. EDF has a right to invest in Approved Projects for an amount up to (1) 75% of the equity capital for an Approved Project, and (2) up to 75% of the equity capital of VS1, VS3 (a proposed 150 MW CSP facility with 12-18 hours of thermal storage located in Port Augusta, South Australia) and SM1 in the aggregate. Neither party will contribute any pre-existing background intellectual property used in the joint effort; however, intellectual property rights developed or derived by either party in connection with the EDF JDA will be jointly owned by both the Company and EDF, and each party grants the other party a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to other intellectual property used in connection with the EDF JDA.\n\nThe EDF JDA will automatically terminate upon the later of (1) seven years from the closing date of the EDF Note Purchase Agreement and (2) the date the parties entered into a JVA with respect to an Approved Project with an expected nameplate capacity equal to or exceeding 200 megawatts, which may include a JVA for VS1, VS3 and SM1. The EDF JDA contains customary provisions regarding certain events of default and each party’s right to terminate its obligations thereunder. In the event a party contemplates a Change of Control of such party, the other party must first consent to such Change of Control but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed if (1) the transferor is the Company, it continues to own 100% of the CSP Technology and the Background IP (as defined therein) and (2) the transferee continues to have the technical and financial capability to perform its obligations under the EDF JDA.As at December 31, 2023, Vast is assessing EDF JDA under the scope of IFRS 11. No further developments have occurred under the JDA that would impact these condensed financial statements.\n\n18. **Subsequent Events**\n\n1) On January 10, 2024, Vast appointed Mr Peter Botten as Chairman and Mr Tom Quinn as non-executive director in addition to its recently expanded Board. Refer to note 1 – General information for detailed composition of the Board.\n\n2) On January 12, 2024, Vast issued an additional 681,620 Ordinary Shares to Nabors Lux for a consideration of $7.0 million pursuant to the Nabors Backstop Agreement, as contemplated in the BCA. The Nabors Backstop Agreement contains a \"most favoured nation clause\" whereby if, prior to the six-month anniversary of the closing of the BCA, and to certain parties during the following three months, Vast completes a capital raise on more favourable terms than those in the Nabors Backstop Agreement, then the shares issued under the Nabors Backstop Agreement may be redeemable for debt or Vast may be required to issue additional equity instruments to Nabors such that the terms of the Nabors Backstop Agreement are equally as favourable. On the basis no issuance of shares has occurred as at December 31, 2023, no receivable was recorded on the Company’s statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023.\n\n3) On February 5, 2024, Vast moved its registered office and principal place of business to the following address:Level 7, Suite 02, 124 Walker StreetNorth SydneyNSW 2060\n\n4) On February 14, 2024, Vast announced, along with its consortium partner Mabanaft, that they have signed funding agreements for up to approximately AUD $40 million for SM1. As announced in January 2023, Vast will receive up to AUD $19.48 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and Mabanaft will receive up to EUR $12.4 million from Projektträger Jülich (PtJ) on behalf of the German government after the SM1 project was selected last year as a part of the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (known as HyGATE).\n\n5) On February 15, 2024, Vast announced that on February 9, 2024, it received a notification (the “Notice”) from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating that the Company is not in compliance with the requirements to maintain a minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (“MVPHS”) of $15,000,000, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) (the “MVPHS Requirement”).\n\nThe Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares (the “Ordinary Shares”), which continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “VSTE.”\n\nThe Notice provided that, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company has a period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until August 7, 2024, to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement. During this period, the Ordinary Shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq. Nasdaq will deem the Company to have regained compliance with the MVPHS Requirement if at any time during this compliance period the Company’s MVPHS closes at $15,000,000 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.\n\nIn the event the Company does not regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement by August 7, 2024, the Company will receive written notification from Nasdaq that the Company’s Ordinary Shares are subject to delisting. The Company is reviewing its options for regaining compliance with the MVPHS Requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement in a timely fashion, in which case its securities may be delisted from Nasdaq.\n\n19. **Capital reorganization (the “SPAC Merger”)**\n\nThe SPAC Merger was accounted for as a capital reorganization by Vast. The merger was achieved by Vast issuing shares to NETC shareholders in exchange for the net liabilities of NETC as of the closing date.\n\nThe SPAC Merger was not within the scope of IFRS 3 because NETC did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Rather, the SPAC Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition, with the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration of NETC over the fair value of NETC’s identifiable net liabilities acquired expensed as service for stock exchange listing under IFRS 2.\n\nVast was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the following:\n\n  * Vast’s previous majority shareholder has a majority voting interest;\n  * AgCentral, a Legacy Vast shareholder, has the ability to nominate the majority of the members of the board of directors;\n  * The existing senior management of Vast continues to be the senior management following the SPAC Merger;\n  * The business of Vast comprises the ongoing operations following the SPAC Merger; and\n  * Vast was the larger entity, both in terms of substantive operations and number of employees.\n\n\n\nShare based listing expenses of $106.0 million represent non-cash IFRS 2 charges recorded in connection with the consummation of the SPAC merger.\n\nThe transaction is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 with an expense reflected for the difference between the fair value of the Ordinary Shares issued to NETC shareholders as compared to the fair value of NETC’s net assets or liabilities, as relevant, contributed. The fair value of the Vast Ordinary Shares was determined based on a quoted market price of $11.99 per Ordinary share at closing as of December 19, 2023.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued to NETC shareholders considers the impact of Ordinary Shares issuable to Legacy Vast shareholders (i.e. AgCentral Energy Pty Ltd and certain employees of Vast), upon the occurrence of certain Triggering Events or earlier, upon a change of control in accordance with the earnout provisions. Refer to note 14 – Reserves for further details.\n\nThe fair value of share consideration of $94.8 million and NETC’s net liabilities of $11.2 million result in an excess of the fair value of the shares issued over the value of the net monetary assets acquired of $106.0 million. The difference is reflected as a share based listing expense of $106.0 million for the services provided by NETC in connection with the listing. The fair value calculation of $94.8 million is based on the estimated fair value of Ordinary Shares issued to NETC shareholders in connection with the SPAC Merger, including an estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares for NETC of $22.6 million.\n\nThese condensed financial statements for the half-year ended December 31, 2023 give effect to the SPAC Merger and related transactions summarized below:\n\nOrdinary Shares issued in exchange for the following (in thousands):  \n---  \nNETC Class A Common Stock (b)| 805  \nBackstop Commitment Fee (f)| 350  \nNETC Class F Common Stock (b)| 3,000  \nAccelerated Earnback Shares (f)|  1,500  \nOrdinary Shares issued| 5,655  \nFair value of Vast shares issued in exchange for NETC shares valued at $11.99 per share| $| 67,799  \nVast Warrants issued in exchange for NETC warrants (c)| 4,129  \nShares issued as settlement of transaction expenses (e)| 307  \nFair value of earnout for NETC Sponsor (g, h)|  22,576  \nFair value of share consideration| 94,811  \nAdjusted NETC’s net liabilities upon closing (a)|  11,206  \nTotal| 106,017  \n  \n(a) the merger of NETC with and into Neptune Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Vast, with NETC surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vast. The net liabilities of NETC upon closing were as follows:\n\nAssets:| **As at December 18, 2023**  \n---|---  \nCash| 9,203  \nPrepaid expenses| 1,325  \n**Total assets**| **10,528**  \nLiabilities:  \nTrade and Other Payables|  21,525  \nIncome taxes payable| 209  \n**Total liabilities**|  **21,734**  \n**Total net liabilities**| **(11,206**| **)**  \n  \n(b) the completion of the Vast pre-closing reorganization, which included the Existing Convertible Note Conversion, the MEP Share Conversion, and the Vast Split Adjustment; the exchange of all outstanding Founder Shares into 3.0 million Ordinary Shares, and all outstanding NETC Class A Shares that were not redeemed by the Class A shareholders into an equivalent number of Ordinary Shares;(c) the exchange of all outstanding NETC Warrants into an equal number of Vast Warrants, with substantially the same terms;(d) the entry into various agreements with CAG, under which CAG committed to invest $7.0 million of PIPE Financing. CAG and Vast agreed that this commitment would be satisfied by CAG’s purchase of Class A common stock of NETC from existing NETC stockholders who previously elected to redeem their shares in connection with the SPAC Merger and whose redemption election would be reversed. The $7.0 million included in Cash has been reflected in Issued Capital of Vast upon consummation of the BCA; (e) the issuance of 171,569 Ordinary Shares to Guggenheim Securities as consideration for its services.
