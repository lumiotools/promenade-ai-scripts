However, reaching a ‘real’ high (accounting for erosion due to inflation) looks out of reach. In a scenario where inflation falls drastically and the Fed makes an early pivot, gold prices stand to do well as bond yields decline more than in the consensus scenario (and using a lower level of inflation, the real value of gold is less discounted).\n\n[Read the paper](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/-/media/us-media-files/documents/resource-library/market-insights/wisdomtree-commentary/gold-outlook-to-q4-2023.pdf)\n\n[ Market Insights ](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/research/category/market-insights)\n\nThe Global Edge: China Re-opens: What It Means for Global Investors\n\nby [Kevin Flanagan, ](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/kevin-flanagan) [Aneeka Gupta, ](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/blog/author/aneeka-gupta) [Liqian Ren, ](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/liqian-ren) [Nitesh Shah, ](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/blog/author/nitesh-shah) [Jeff Weniger, CFA](https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/jeff-weniger)\n\n02/2023\n\nAs global investors stand weeks away from the end of 2022, it is interesting to note that some things just don’t change.

          "content": "WisdomTree Emerging Markets Quality\nDGRE\nDividend Growth Fund\nWhen performance lags in any asset class, the natural emotional response is to consider changing or reducing\nallocations. However, if we follow traditional investment wisdom, the optimal time to buy is when prices are\nlow. In fact, we believe it might be better to diversify existing holdings within emerging markets.\nWisdomTree created a forward-looking dividend growth exchange-traded Fund (ETF), the WisdomTree\nEmerging Markets Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRE).\nCAPTURING EMERGING MARKET DIVIDEND GROWTH\nDividend-paying equities have increasingly become an attractive option for investors looking to generate\nincome and pursue higher total return potential. Consider the following:\n+ Although emerging markets are associated with a high degree of volatility, their strong economic growth\ncharacteristics nevertheless make them attractive.\n+ We believe that dividends are an important indicator of value for emerging markets and utilizing them\nthrough different selection and weighting methodologies can help more finely align exposures with economic\noutlooks.\n+ Using a forward-looking process and fundamental weighting may help create a portfolio of quality emerging\nmarket companies with higher growth expectations and lower leverage1.\n+ Dividend indexes with backward-looking growth screens may fail to capture present growth opportunities.\n+ Dividend strategies that screen for the fundamental metrics we believe to be associated with greater potential\nfor future dividend growth may help investors capitalize on dividend growth trends as they occur.\nBEING STUCK IN THE PAST MAY COST YOU\nWhen trying to capture dividend growth themes, most of the more popular indexes employ backward-looking\ndividend growth screens that require a company to have raised dividends for 10 or even 20 consecutive years\nbefore becoming eligible for inclusion. This may seem like a smart idea, but it keeps many investors from\ncapitalizing on the shifting trends in the dividend landscape in general—and specifically may not work in\nemerging markets. Remember that:\n+ Emerging markets may have newer dividend payers and more volatile dividend streams2.\n+ Emerging market companies generally raise and lower their dividends with their profits—a significant contrast\nto the behavior typically displayed by U.S. companies, which tend to manage their cash flows with consistent\n1 Leverage: Total assets divided by equity. Higher numbers indicate greater borrowing to finance asset purchases; leverage tends to make\npositive performance more positive and negative performance more negative.\n2 Dividend Stream: refers to regular dividends per share multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nDGRE WisdomTree Emerging Markets Quality Dividend Growth Fund 2\ndividend payments.\n+ Indexes utilizing backward-looking growth screens may miss the best opportunities for future dividend\ngrowth when it comes to emerging markets.\nDGRE LOOKS TO THE FUTURE\nDGRE is a rules-based active ETF that seeks to capture equity performance and dividend growth potential of\nemerging markets.\n+ Large- and mid-cap dividend-paying companies from emerging market\nEligible Universe:\ncountries (outside of China)\n+ Exclude companies based on proprietary measures of dividend\nDividend Sustainability: sustainability (including high dividend yield3, weak price momentum4,\nlow dividend coverage ratio5)\n+ Approximately 275 dividend-paying companies based on composite\nStock Selection:\nfactor score (Quality6/Dividend Growth)\n+ At minimum annually based on modified market-cap weighting (market\nRebalance Frequency:\ncap scaled up/down by composite factor score)\nDGRE IN A PORTFOLIO\nDGRE applies its selection criteria in an attempt to raise the probability of generating exposure to future\ndividend growers and quality companies earning a high return on assets and equity.\nCharacteristics (as of 9/30/2024)\nPrice-to- Dividend 30-Day SEC\nFund/Index ROE ROA\nEarnings7 Yield Yield8\nWisdomTree Emerging Markets Quality Dividend Growth\n15.29 2.63% 1.96% 13.96% 3.83%\nFund\nMSCI Emerging Markets Index 15.17 2.44% N/A 11.39% 1.66%\n3 Dividend yield: A financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its share price.\n4 Momentum: Characterized by assets with recent price increase trends over time.\n5 Dividend coverage ratio: Earnings per share divided by dividends per share. Higher numbers indicate a firm has a greater amount of\nearnings per share relative to its dividend payments.\n6 Quality measured by profitability ratios including Return-on-Equity, Return-on-Assets, Gross Profits-over-Assets, and Cash Flow-over-\nAssets. Return on Equity (ROE): Measures a corporation’s profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money\nshareholders have invested. Return on assets (ROA): Firm profits (after accounting for all expenses) divided by the firm’s total assets. Higher\nnumbers indicate greater profits relative to the level of assets utilized to generate them. Gross profits over assets (GPOA): Measures a\ncorporation’s profitability by revealing how much gross profit a company generates relative to the level of assets used to generate them.\nCash flow over assets (CFOA): Measures a corporation’s profitability by revealing how much cash flow a company generates relative to the\nlevel of assets used to generate them.\n7Price-to-Earnings Ratio: Share price divided by earnings per share. Lower numbers indicate an ability to access greater amounts of\nearnings per dollar invested.\n8 30-day SEC yield: The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after deduction of the Fund’s expenses.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nDGRE WisdomTree Emerging Markets Quality Dividend Growth Fund 3\nSource: WisdomTree, FactSet.
