In accordance with the 2020 Code, each\nannual report of MDxHealth contains a “Corporate Governance Statement” (the “Corporate\nGovernance Statement”) in which the board of directors provides further information on its corporate\ngovernance and the application of this Charter.\nIn case of any contradiction between a provision of this Charter and an applicable mandatory law or\nregulation, such law or regulation supersedes the provision of this Charter.\nThe Charter is available on the “Investors – Shareholders’ Information” section of the company’s\nwebsite (www.mdxhealth.com) and can be obtained free of charge at the registered office of the\ncompany.\nOn behalf of the board of directors of MDxHealth,\n8 November 2021\nii\nCertain definitions and expressions\nThroughout this Charter, certain terms and expressions are used. Unless the context in which these\nterms and expressions are used, do not so permit, or unless these terms or expressions are defined\ndifferently, they should be read and understood as follows:\n Any reference to “the company” or “MDxHealth” should be read as a reference to MDxHealth\nSA.\n The expression “subsidiary” means, when used with respect to a person, a subsidiary of such\nperson within the meaning of article 1:15 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code\n(filiale).\n The expression “control” shall, when used with respect to a person, have the meaning as\ndefined in article 1:14 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code, and shall be\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions of articles 1:14 to 1:18 of the Belgian Companies\nand Associations Code, and expressions such as “controlling” or “controlled” shall have a\ncorrelative meaning.\n “FSMA” means the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (Autorité des Services et\nMarchés Financiers).\nThis Charter is complementary to the Belgian Companies and Associations Code and the articles of\nassociation of MDxHealth.

Implications of being an emerging growth company and foreign private issuer under\nUnited States securities law\n1.9.1. Implications of being an emerging growth company\nAs a company with less than USD 1.07 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year, MDxHealth\nqualifies as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups\nAct of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth company, MDxHealth may\ntake advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise\napplicable generally to U.S. public companies. These provisions include:\n the ability to present only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any\nrequired interim financial statements and correspondingly reduced disclosure in\nmanagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in\nthis prospectus;\n exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, in the assessment of MDxHealth's internal controls over financial reporting;\nand\n to the extent that MDxHealth no longer qualify as a foreign private issuer, (i) reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in MDxHealth's periodic reports\nand proxy statements and (ii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding\nadvisory vote on executive compensation, including golden parachute compensation.\nMDxHealth may take advantage of these exemptions until such time that it is no longer an\nemerging growth company. MDxHealth will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the\nearliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which it has more than USD 1.07 billion\nin annual revenue; (ii) the date MDxHealth qualifies as a “large accelerated filer” with at least\nUSD 700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (iii) the issuance, in any three year\nperiod, by MDxHealth of more than USD 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities held by\nnon-affiliates; and (iv) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the initial\npublic offering of the ADSs.\nMDxHealth may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can use\nthe extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Given that MDxHealth\ncurrently reports and expects to continue to report under IFRS, as issued by the IASB,\nMDxHealth has irrevocably elected not to avail itself of the extended transition period and, as a\nresult, MDxHealth will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on\nwhich adoption of such standards is required by the IASB.\n1.9.2. Implications of being a foreign private issuer\nMDxHealth is also considered a “foreign private issuer” under U.S. securities laws. In its\ncapacity as a foreign private issuer, MDxHealth is exempt from certain rules under the\nExchange Act that impose certain disclosure obligations and procedural requirements for proxy\nsolicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. In addition, members of the board of\ndirectors and MDxHealth principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and “short-\nswing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the\nExchange Act with respect to their purchases and sales of securities. Moreover, MDxHealth is\nnot required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as\npromptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. In\naddition, MDxHealth is not required to comply with Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure), which\nrestricts the selective disclosure of material information.\nMDxHealth may take advantage of these exemptions until such time as it is no longer a foreign\nprivate issuer. MDxHealth will remain a foreign private issuer until such time that more than\n4\n50% of the outstanding voting securities are held by U.S. residents and any of the following\nthree circumstances applies: (i) the majority of the members of the board of directors are U.S.\ncitizens or residents; (ii) more than 50% of the assets are located in the United States; or (iii)\nits business is administered principally in the United States.\nMDxHealth has taken advantage of certain reduced reporting and other requirements.\n1.10. Differences between MDxHealth corporate governance practices and the Listing Rules\nof the Nasdaq Capital Market\nThe Listing Rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market include certain accommodations in relation to\ncorporate governance requirements that allow foreign private issuers, to follow “home country”\ncorporate governance practices in lieu of the otherwise applicable corporate governance\nstandards of the Nasdaq Capital Market. The application of such exceptions requires that\nMDxHealth discloses each instance of non-compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market Listing\nRules that it does not follow and describe the Belgian corporate governance practices that\nMDxHealth does follow in lieu of the relevant Nasdaq Capital Market corporate governance\nstandard.\nMDxHealth intends to continue to follow Belgian corporate governance practices in lieu of the\ncorporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market in respect of the following:\n Quorum at general shareholders' meetings: Nasdaq Capital Market Listing Rule\n5620(c) requires that for any meeting of shareholders, the quorum must be no less than\n33.33% of the outstanding shares of common voting stock. There is no general quorum\nrequirement under Belgian law for ordinary meetings of shareholders, except in relation\nto decisions regarding certain matters.\n Nomination and remuneration committee: Nasdaq Capital Market Listing Rule\n5605(d)(2) requires that compensation of officers must be determined by, or\nrecommended to, the board of directors for determination, either by a majority of the\nindependent directors, or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent\ndirectors. Nasdaq Capital Market Listing Rule 5605(e) requires that director nominees\nbe selected, or recommended for selection, either by a majority of the independent\ndirectors or a nomination committee comprised solely of independent directors. Under\nBelgian law, MDxHealth is not subject to any such requirements. In particular,\nMDxHealth is not required by Belgian law to set up any nomination or nomination\ncommittees within the board of directors, and are therefore not subject to any Belgian\nlegal requirements as to the composition of such committees. However, the articles of\nassociation provide that the board of directors may form committees from among its\nmembers. Accordingly, the board of directors has set up and appointed a nomination\nand remuneration committee. Pursuant to article 7:100 of the Belgian Companies and\nAssociations Code, only a majority of the members of the remuneration committee\nshould in principle meet the independence criteria referred to in article 7:87 of the\nBelgian Companies and Associations Code and set out in provision 3.5 of the 2020\nCode. Pursuant to provision 4.19 of the 2020 Code, only a majority of the members of\nthe remuneration committee must qualify as independent.\n Charters: Nasdaq Capital Market Listing Rules 5605(c)(1), (d)(1) and (e)(2) require that\neach committee of the board of directors must have a formal written charter. Pursuant\nto the 2020 Code, this Charter includes, amongst others, the internal rules of the\ncommittees of MDxHealth.\n Independent director majority: Nasdaq Capital Market Listing Rules 5605(b)(1) and (2)\nrequire that a majority of the board of directors must be comprised of independent\ndirectors and that independent directors must have regularly scheduled meetings at\nwhich only independent directors are present. MDxHealth is not required under Belgian\nlaw to have a majority of independent directors on its board of directors. However,\nMDxHealth's articles of association provide that its board of directors must be\n5\ncomprised of at least three directors, of which, pursuant to this Charter and provision\n3.4 of the 2020 Code, at least three directors must be independent directors under\nBelgian law. Furthermore, in line with the provisions of the Belgian Companies and\nAssociations Code and the 2020 Code, the nomination and remuneration committee\nshould consist of a majority of independent directors, and the audit committee should\nhave at least one independent director among its members.\n Meetings of independent directors: Nasdaq Capital Market Listing Rule 5605(b)(2)\nrequires that independent directors must have regularly scheduled meetings at which\nonly independent directors are present. MDxHealth does not require its independent\ndirectors to meet separately from the full board of directors on a regular basis or at all,\nalthough the board of directors is supportive of its independent members voluntarily\narranging to meet separately from the other members of MDxHealth's board of\ndirectors when and if they wish to do so.\n Shareholder approval of equity compensation arrangements: Nasdaq Capital Market\nListing Rule 5635(c) requires shareholder approval when a plan or other equity\ncompensation arrangement is established or materially amended. Under Belgian law\nthe establishment or amendment of equity compensation arrangements does not\nrequire a prior approval by the general shareholders’ meeting. However, pursuant to\nBelgian law the shareholders of MDxHealth must decide any issuance of new equity,\nas a general matter. The shareholders may also authorise the board of directors, within\ncertain limits, to issue new equity (including equity compensation arrangements) in the\nframework of the so-called authorised capital. By virtue of a resolution of MDxHealth's\nextraordinary general shareholders’ meeting of 27 May 2021, MDxHealth's board of\ndirectors was authorised to issue equity (including equity compensation arrangements)\nin the framework of the authorised capital. Furthermore, the compensation of director\nmandates is subject to an approval by the general shareholders’ meeting.\n2. Board of directors\n2.1.

However, in\naccordance with the Belgian Companies and Association Code, if the mandate of a director\nbecomes vacant, the remaining directors have the right to appoint temporarily a new director to\nfill the vacancy until the first general shareholders’ meeting after the mandate became vacant.\nThe new director completes the term of the director whose mandate became vacant. While the\nlegal maximum (renewable) term for a director’s mandate is six years, directors can be elected\nfor a maximum (renewable) term of four years only.\n2.3.4. Nomination procedure\nThe nomination and remuneration committee of the board of directors of MDxHealth will lead\nthe nomination process for a new director and recommend suitable candidates to the board of\ndirectors.

The nomination and\nremuneration committee should also assess whether the contribution of each board member is\nadapted to changing circumstances.\nThe board of directors will act on the results of the performance evaluation. Where appropriate,\nthis will involve proposing new board members for appointment, proposing not to re-appoint\nexisting board members or taking any measure deemed appropriate for the effective operation\nof the board.\n2.5. Chair of the board of directors\nAn important function within the board of directors is reserved to the chair, who leads the board\nof directors, takes measures to engender a climate of trust, allowing for open discussions and\nconstructive challenge, and supervises the good and efficient functioning of the board of\ndirectors.\n9\nThe chair should be a person trusted for his or her professionalism, independence of mind,\ncoaching capabilities, ability to build consensus, and communication and meeting management\nskills. The board of directors elects a chair from among its non-executive members on the basis\nof his or her knowledge, skills, experience and mediation strength. The chair of the board of\ndirectors and the CEO should not be the same individual. If the board envisages appointing a\nformer CEO as chair, it should carefully consider the positive and negative implications of such\na decision and disclose in the Corporate Governance Statement why such appointment will not\nhamper the required autonomy of the CEO. In case the chair is absent or for chairing\ndiscussions and decision-making by the board of directors on matters where the chair has a\nconflict of interest, the other directors shall appoint a replacement chair among the independent\ndirectors by majority vote.\nThe chair determines the calendar and the agenda of the meetings of the board of directors in\nconsultation with the CEO and the company secretary.

Once decisions are taken, all board members should\nbe supportive of their execution.\nThe chair should establish a close relationship with the CEO, providing support and advice,\nshould ensure effective interaction between the board and the executive management.\nThe chair should ensure effective communication with shareholders and that board members\ndevelop and maintain an understanding of the views of the shareholders and other significant\nstakeholders.\n2.6. Non-executive directors and independent directors\n2.6.1. Non-executive directors\nNon-executive directors should be made aware of the extent of their duties at the time of their\napplication as director, in particular as to the time commitment involved in carrying out their\nduties, also taking into account the number and importance of their other commitments.\nWhile exceptions may be warranted in view of the company’s interest, non-executive directors\nare encouraged not to take on more than five directorships in listed companies.

Independent directors\nA director will only qualify as an independent director if he or she does not have a relationship\nwith the company or an important shareholder of the company which jeopardizes his or her\nindependence. In case the director is a legal entity, the independence of such director must be\nassessed both for the legal entity as for its permanent representative. In order to assess\nwhether a candidate director meets the aforementioned condition, the criteria set out in\nprovision 3.5 of the 2020 Code will be applied.\nIn case the board of directors proposes a candidate director who does not meet the above\ncriteria to the general shareholders’ meeting for appointment as independent director, it will set\nout the reasons why it deems that the candidate is independent.\n10\nThe board of directors will disclose in its Corporate Governance Statement which directors it\nconsiders to be independent directors.

Interactions between\nboard members and executives should take place in a transparent way, and the chair should\nalways be informed.\nThe board of directors intends to empower executive management to enable it to perform its\nresponsibilities and duties. Taking into account the company’s values, its risk appetite and key\npolicies, executive management should have sufficient latitude to propose and implement\ncorporate strategy.\nThe current terms of reference of the CEO and other executive management are set out in\nSection 5.\n2.9. Company secretary\nThe board of directors appoints a secretary who has the necessary skills and knowledge of\ncorporate governance matters.\nThe role of the secretary includes supporting the board and its committees on all governance\nmatters, preparing the Charter and the Corporate Governance Statement, ensuring a good\ninformation flow within the board and its committees and between the executive management\nand the non-executive board members, drafting the minutes of the board meetings (ensuring\nthat the essence of the discussions and decisions at board meeting are accurately captured),\nand facilitating induction and assisting with professional development of directors as required.\nIndividual board members should have access to the company secretary.\n2.10.

Board members should handle the\nconfidential information received in their capacity as a board member with utmost care.\n12\n2.11.3. Integrity and independence of mind\nBoard members should engage actively in their duties and should be able to make their own\nsound, objective and independent judgements when discharging their responsibilities.

Tasks\nThe tasks of the heads of the main activities and central departments (and their divisions) are\nthe following:\n They must organize their business unit/department in accordance with the guidelines\ndetermined by the CEO.\n They report to the CEO on the operation and activities of their business\nunit/department.\n5.5. Operation of executive management\n5.5.1. Conduct of meetings\nThe executive managers will periodically meet with CEO to discuss:\n The strategy of their department.\n The organization of their department.\n The financial management of their department.\n New projects.\n Compliance with budgets.\n The follow-up of existing projects.\nAt least on a monthly basis, the CEO and other executive managers shall meet to discuss the\noverall general strategy, financial management and business of the company. During these\nmeetings, the executive management also discusses proposals for decisions to be made by\nthe board of directors, including with respect to strategy, planning, finances and budgets.\nAdditional meetings can be called by the CEO whenever the need for such meetings arises.\n5.5.2. Reporting to the board of directors\nThe CEO shall report regularly during the scheduled meetings of the board of directors on the\noperations, findings and recommendations of the committee.\nThe members of the board of directors can have access to the assistance or advice of the\nexecutive management. Where practical or appropriate, requests to have such access should\nbe made via the CEO.\n5.6. Conduct by executive management\n5.6.1. General\nEach executive manager is encouraged to exhibit at all times the highest standards of integrity\nand probity. They must be loyal to the company and its subsidiaries.\n5.6.2. Confidentiality\nExecutive managers cannot use the information obtained in their capacity as executive\nmanager for purposes other than for the exercise of their mandate.\nExecutive managers should treat all inside information (as defined by applicable law) as strictly\nconfidential, and should disclose such information to other employees and staff members of\nthe company and its subsidiaries only on a need-to-know basis, subject to appropriate\nmeasures to secure confidentiality and in accordance with the guidelines established by the\nboard of directors.\n25\n5.6.3. Conflicts of interest\nEach executive manager is encouraged to arrange his or her personal and business affairs so\nas to avoid direct and indirect conflicts of interest with the company.\nTo the extent relevant, the Section 2.11.4 (see above) is mutatis mutandis applicable to\nexecutive managers.\nThe above is without prejudice to the rules that apply to executive directors in the performance\nof their mandate as director.\n6. Remuneration of directors and managers\n6.1. Remuneration policy\nThe board of directors should adopt, upon the advice of the nomination and remuneration\ncommittee, a remuneration policy designed to (i) attract, reward and retain the necessary talent,\n(ii) promote the achievement of strategic objectives in accordance with the company’s risk\nappetite and behavioural norms, and (iii) promote sustainable value creation.\nThe board of directors should make sure that the remuneration policy is consistent with the\noverall remuneration framework of the company, as well as the provisions of the 2020 Code\nand the Belgian Companies and Associations Code.\nArticle 7:89/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code, which provides that listed\ncompanies must establish a remuneration policy with respect to directors, other officers and\ndelegates for day-to-day management, details the objectives of, as well as the information that\nneeds to be included in, the remuneration policy. The remuneration policy must be approved\nby a binding vote of the general shareholders' meeting and must be submitted to the general\nshareholders' meeting for approval whenever there is a material change and in any case at\nleast every four years.\nIn addition, in accordance with the 2020 Code:\n For non-executive board members, the remuneration policy should take into account\ntheir role as board members, and specific roles such as chair of the board, or chair or\nmember of board committees, as well as their resulting responsibilities and\ncommitment in time.\n Non-executive board members should not receive any performance-related\nremuneration that is directly related to the results of the company.\n For executives, the remuneration policy should describe the different components of\nand determine an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration, and\ncash and deferred remuneration.\n The variable part of the executive remuneration package should be structured to link\nreward to overall corporate and individual performance, and to align the interests of the\nexecutives with the sustainable value-creation objectives of the company.\n When the company awards short-term variable remuneration to the executive\nmanagement, this remuneration should be subject to a cap.\n The board should approve the main terms and conditions of the contracts of the CEO\nand other executives further to the advice of the remuneration committee. The\ncontracts should contain specific provisions relating to early termination.\nFollowing the modification of the directors' remuneration on 30 July 2020, effective as from 1\nJuly 2020, the non-executive directors that are not independent directors shall not be entitled\nto a remuneration in cash, but shall each year be entitled to receive share options for a\nmaximum of 10,000 shares of the company. This is contrary to provision 7.6 of the 2020 Code,\nwhich provides that no share options should be granted to non-executive directors. The\ncompany believes that this provision of the 2020 Code is not appropriate and adapted to take\ninto account the realities of companies in the biotech and life sciences industry that are still in\n26\na development phase. Notably, the ability to remunerate non-executive directors with share\noptions allows the company to limit the portion of remuneration in cash that the company would\notherwise need to pay to attract or retain renowned experts with the most relevant skills,\nknowledge and expertise. The company is of the opinion that granting non-independent non-\nexecutive directors the opportunity to be remunerated in part in share-based incentives rather\nthan all in cash enables the non-independent non-executive directors to link their effective\nremuneration to the performance of the company and to strengthen the alignment of their\ninterests with the interests of the company’s shareholders. The company believes that this is in\nthe interest of the company and its stakeholders. Furthermore, the company believes that this\nis customary for directors active in companies in the life sciences industry.\nIn accordance with provision 7.6 of the 2020 Code, the non-executive directors should receive\na part of their remuneration in the form of shares of the company. The company has however\nno distributable reserves and therefore does not meet the legal requirements to proceed to a\nshares buy-back. As a result, the company does not own any treasury shares and is unable to\ngrant existing shares to non-executive directors as part of their remuneration. The interests of\nthe non-independent non-executive directors are currently considered to be sufficiently oriented\nto the creation of long-term value for the company. Finally, the board will propose to remunerate\nthe independent directors in cash, but leaving it at the own initiative of the independent directors\nwhether or not they wish to use such funds (in whole or in part) to acquire existing shares of\nthe company.\nIn accordance with provision 7.9 of the 2020 Code, the board of directors should set a minimum\nthreshold of shares to be held by the executive management. A part of the remuneration of the\nexecutive management consists of options to subscribe for the company’s shares, which should\nallow the executive management over time to acquire shares of the company, in line with the\nobjectives of the option plans.\nPursuant to article 7:91 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code and provision 7.11\nof the 2020 Code, shares should not vest and share options should not be exercisable within\nthree years as of their granting. It has been expressly provided by the company's general\nshareholders' meeting that the board of directors is explicitly authorised to deviate from the\nprovisions of 7:91 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code, for all persons who fall\nwithin the scope of these provisions (whether directly or pursuant to articles 7:108 and 7:121 of\nthe Belgian Companies and Associations Code, or otherwise). The company is of the opinion\nthat this allows for more flexibility when structuring share-based awards. For example, it is\ncustomary for option plans to provide for a vesting in several instalments over a well-defined\nperiod of time, instead of vesting after three years only. This seems to be more in line with\nprevailing practice.\nIn accordance with provision 7.12 of the 2020 Code, the board of directors should include\nprovisions that would enable the company to recover variable remuneration paid, or withhold\nthe payment of variable remuneration, and specify the circumstances in which it would be\nappropriate to do so, insofar as enforceable by law. The company believes that this provision\nof the 2020 Code is not appropriate and adapted to take into account the realities of companies\nin the biotech and life sciences industry, including, notably, for management teams located in\nthe United States. The share option plans set up by the company do however contain bad\nleaver provisions that can result in the share options, whether vested or not, automatically and\nimmediately becoming null and void. Notwithstanding the company's position that share options\nare not to be qualified as variable remuneration, the board of directors is of the opinion that\nsuch bad leaver provisions sufficiently protect the company's interests and that it is therefore\ncurrently no necessary to provide for additional contractual provisions that give the company a\ncontractual right to reclaim any (variable) remuneration from the members of the executive\nmanagement. For that reason, there are no contractual provisions in place between the\ncompany and the members of the executive management that give the company a contractual\nright to reclaim from said executives any variable remuneration that would be awarded.\n27\n6.2. Remuneration report\nThe board of directors of the company is to adopt a remuneration report which is to be submitted\nto the board of directors by the nomination and remuneration committee.\nThe remuneration report shall be drafted in a clear and comprehensible manner. It shall provide\na comprehensive overview of the remuneration, including all benefits, in whatever form, granted\nor due during the financial year covered by the annual report to each of the directors and the\nmembers of the executive management, including newly recruited and former senior\nexecutives, in accordance with the remuneration policy.\nThe remuneration report must contain all legally required information in accordance with article\n3:6, §3 and §3/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code.\nThe remuneration report forms a well-defined part of the Corporate Governance Statement.\n7. Shares and Shareholders\n7.1. General\nThe board of directors intends to treat all shareholders that are in the same situation equally\nand to respect their rights.\n7.2. Communication with shareholders and potential shareholders\nThe disclosure and communication policy of the company is to promote an effective dialogue\nwith the shareholders and potential shareholders through appropriate investor relation\nprogrammes, in order to achieve a better understanding of their objectives and concerns.\nFeedback of such dialogue should be given to the board, on at least an annual basis.\nThe company will ensure that all necessary facilities and information are available in order to\nallow the shareholders to exercise their rights.\nThe board of directors also encourages its shareholders to participate to its shareholders'\nmeetings, through which communication between the company and the shareholders can be\nestablished.\nIn the event that the company should have one or more controlling shareholders, the board will\nendeavour to have the controlling shareholders make a considered used of its/their position\nand respect the rights and interests of minority shareholders. The board will to the extent\npossible encourage the controlling shareholders to clearly express their strategic objectives\nand to respect the corporate governance principles.\n7.3. Rights and obligations of the shareholders\nThis Section 7.3 summarizes the material rights and obligations of the shareholders of the\ncompany under Belgian law and the company’s articles of association. The description\nhereafter is only a summary and does not purport to give a complete overview of the articles of\nassociation, nor of all relevant provisions of Belgian law. Neither should it be considered as\nlegal advice regarding these matters.\n7.3.1. Form and transferability of the shares\nThe company’s shares can take the form of dematerialized or registered shares. A register of\nregistered shares (which may be held in electronic form) is maintained at the company's\nregistered office. It may be consulted by any holder of shares. A dematerialized share will be\nrepresented by an entry on a personal account of the owner or holder, with a recognized\naccount holder or clearing and settlement institution. Holders of shares may elect, at any time,\n28\nto have their registered shares converted into dematerialized shares, and vice versa, at their\nown expense\nAll of the company’s shares are fully paid up and freely transferable. This is without prejudice\nto certain restrictions that may apply pursuant to applicable securities laws requirements.\n7.3.2. Currency of the shares\nThe company's shares do not have a nominal value, but reflect the same fraction of the\ncompany's share capital, which is denominated in euro.\n7.3.3. Voting rights attached to the shares\nEach shareholder of the company is entitled to one vote per share. There are no different\ncategories of shares. Shareholders may vote by proxy, subject to the rules described in the\ncompany's articles of association.\nVoting rights can be mainly suspended in relation to shares:\n which are not fully paid up, notwithstanding the request thereto of the board of directors\nof the company;\n to which more than one person is entitled or on which more than one person has rights\nin rem (droits réels) on, except in the event a single representative is appointed for the\nexercise of the voting right vis-à-vis the company;\n which entitle their holder to voting rights above the threshold of 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%,\n20% and any further multiple of 5% of the total number of voting rights attached to the\noutstanding financial instruments of the company on the date of the relevant general\nshareholders' meeting, in the event that the relevant shareholder has not notified the\ncompany and the FSMA at least 20 calendar days prior to the date of the general\nshareholders' meeting in accordance with the applicable rules on disclosure of major\nshareholdings; and\n of which the voting right was suspended by a competent court or the FSMA.\nPursuant to the Belgian Companies and Associations Code, the voting rights attached to shares\nowned by the company, or a person acting in its own name but on behalf of the company, or\nacquired by a subsidiary of the company, as the case may be, are suspended. Generally, the\ngeneral shareholders' meeting has sole authority with respect to:\n the approval of the annual financial statements of the company;\n the distribution of profits (except interim dividends);\n the appointment (at the proposal of the board of directors and upon recommendation\nby the remuneration and nomination committee) and dismissal of directors of the\ncompany;\n the appointment (at the proposal of the board of directors and upon recommendation\nby the audit committee) and dismissal of the statutory auditor of the company;\n the granting of release from liability to the directors and the statutory auditor of the\ncompany;\n the determination of the remuneration of the directors and of the statutory auditor for\nthe exercise of their mandate;\n the advisory vote on the remuneration report included in the annual report of the board\nof directors, the binding vote on the remuneration policy that the company intends to\nsubmit for the first time to the general shareholders’ meeting to be held on 27 May\n2021, and subsequently upon every material change to the remuneration policy and in\nany case at least every four years, and the determination of the following features of\nthe remuneration or compensation of directors, members of the executive management\nand certain other executives (as the case may be): (i) in relation to the remuneration of\nexecutive and non-executive directors, members of the executive management and\nother executives, an exemption from the rule that share based awards can only vest\nafter a period of at least three years as of the grant of the awards, (ii) in relation to the\n29\nremuneration of executive directors, members of the executive management and other\nexecutives, an exemption from the rule that (unless the variable remuneration is less\nthan a quarter of the annual remuneration) at least one quarter of the variable\nremuneration must be based on performance criteria that have been determined in\nadvance and that can be measured objectively over a period of at least two years and\nthat at least another quarter of the variable remuneration must be based on\nperformance criteria that have been determined in advance and that can be measured\nobjectively over a period of at least three years, (iii) in relation to the remuneration of\nnon-executive directors, any variable part of the remuneration (provided, however that\nno variable remuneration can be granted to independent non-executive directors), and\n(iv) any service agreements to be entered into with executive directors, members of\nthe executive management and other executives providing for severance payments\nexceeding twelve months’ remuneration (or, subject to a motivated opinion by the\nremuneration and nomination committee, eighteen (18) months' remuneration);\n the filing of a claim for liability against directors;\n the decisions relating to the dissolution, merger and certain other reorganizations of\nthe company; and\n the approval of amendments to the articles of association.\n7.3.4. General shareholders' meeting\nThe company encourages its shareholders to participate in general shareholders' meetings. In\norder to facilitate this, shareholders may vote in absentia by proxy voting. Agendas and all other\nrelevant information are made available on the company's website in advance of general\nshareholders' meetings.\nNotices of all shareholders’ meetings, and all related documents, such as specific board of\ndirectors’ and auditor’s reports, are published on the company’s website. The notices will also\nprovide appropriate additional information regarding the specific formalities to be fulfilled for\nadmission, participation and voting at general shareholders’ meetings, including with respect to\nvoting by distance and/or proxy.\n7.3.5.

All of the\nshares participate equally in the company's profits (if any). Pursuant to the Belgian Companies\nand Associations Code, the shareholders can in principle decide on the distribution of profits\nwith a simple majority vote at the occasion of the annual general shareholders' meeting, based\non the most recent statutory audited financial statements, prepared in accordance with Belgian\nGAAP and based on a (non-binding) proposal of the company's board of directors. The Belgian\nCompanies and Associations Code and the company's articles of association also authorize\nthe board of directors to declare interim dividends without shareholder approval. The right to\npay such interim dividends is, however, subject to certain legal restrictions.\nThe company's ability to distribute dividends is subject to availability of sufficient distributable\nprofits as defined under Belgian law on the basis of the company's stand-alone statutory\naccounts prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP. In particular, dividends can only be\ndistributed if following the declaration and issuance of the dividends the amount of the\ncompany's net assets on the date of the closing of the last financial year as follows from the\nstatutory non-consolidated financial statements (i.e. summarized, the amount of the assets as\nshown in the balance sheet, decreased with provisions and liabilities, all in accordance with\nBelgian accounting rules), decreased with, except in exceptional cases, to be disclosed and\njustified in the notes to the annual accounts, the non-amortized costs of incorporation and\nextension and the non-amortized costs for research and development, does not fall below the\namount of the paid-up capital (or, if higher, the issued capital), increased with the amount of\nnon-distributable reserves.\nIn addition, pursuant to Belgian law and the company's articles of association, the company\nmust allocate an amount of 5% of its Belgian GAAP annual net profit (bénéfices nets) to a legal\n30\nreserve in its stand-alone statutory accounts, until the legal reserve amounts to 10% of the\ncompany's share capital.\n7.3.6. Notification of significant participations\nPursuant to the Belgian Act of 2 May 2007 (as amended from time to time) on the disclosure of\nsignificant shareholdings in issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated\nmarket and containing various provisions, a notification to the company and to the FSMA is\nrequired by all natural persons and legal entities (i.e. legal persons, registered business\nassociations without legal personality and trusts) in the following circumstances (non-\nexhaustive list):\n an acquisition or disposal of voting securities, voting rights or financial instruments that\nare treated as voting securities;\n the holding of voting securities upon first admission thereof to trading on a regulated\nmarket;\n the conclusion, modification or termination of an agreement to act in concert;\n the passive reaching of a threshold;\n the reaching of a threshold by persons or legal entities acting in concert;\n the downward reaching of the lowest threshold;\n where a previous notification concerning the financial instruments treated as equivalent\nto voting securities is to be updated;\n the acquisition or disposal of the control of an entity that holds the voting securities; and\n where the company introduces additional notification thresholds in the articles of\nassociation,\nin each case where the percentage of voting rights attached to the securities held by such\npersons reaches, exceeds or falls below the legal threshold, set at 5% of the total voting rights,\nand 10%, 15%, 20% and further multiples of 5% or, as the case may be, the additional\nthresholds provided in the articles of association. The company has provided for an additional\nthreshold of 3% in the articles of association.\nThe notification must be made immediately and at the latest within four trading days after the\ndate on which the notification requirement is triggered. Where the company receives a\ntransparency notification, it has to publish such information within three trading days following\nreceipt of the notification.\nSubject to certain exceptions, no shareholder may, pursuant to article 25/1 of the Belgian Law\nof 2 May 2007 on the disclosure of major participations in issuers of which shares are admitted\nto trading on a regulated market and regarding miscellaneous provisions, cast a greater number\nof votes at a general shareholders' meeting of the company than those attached to the rights\nand securities that it has notified in accordance with the aforementioned disclosure rules at\nleast 20 calendar days prior to the date of the general shareholders' meeting.\nThe forms on which such notifications must be made, as well as further explanations, can be\nfound on the website of the FSMA (www.fsma.be). Violation of the disclosure requirements may\nresult in the suspension of voting rights, a court order to sell the securities to a third party and/or\ncriminal liability. The FSMA may also impose administrative sanctions.\nThe company is required to publicly disclose any notifications of significant shareholdings\nreceived, and must mention these notifications in the notes to its financial statements. A list as\nwell as a copy of such notifications will be accessible on the company's website\n(www.mdxhealth.com).\n31\n7.3.7. Prevention of market abuse\nThe board of directors has adopted a dealing code to prevent market abuse by its directors and\nexecutive managers. The dealing code includes the procedures that should be followed by\ndirectors, executive managers and other staff members and their affiliates or relatives:\n with respect to treating confidential inside information, and\n trades by them in financial instruments of the company, whether directly or indirectly.\nWith respect to trading in financial instruments of the company, the dealing code provides for\nthe following rules:\n No trades in financial instruments are permitted during certain blocked periods before\nthe release of annual and semi-annual financial statements and whenever the person\nconcerned has inside information that has not yet been disclosed to the market. During\nother periods, any trade contemplated must be reported to the compliance officer who\ncan decide to prohibit the trade during a term of no more than two months.\n All trades in financial instruments must be reported two business days on forehand to\nthe compliance officer. These trades in shares will be disclosed by the company in line\nwith applicable legislation.\n Trades are defined as any sale or purchase of, or agreement to sell or purchase, any\nfinancial instrument of the company, and the grant, acceptance, acquisition, disposal,\nexercise or discharge of any option (whether for the call, or put, or both) or other right\nor obligation, present or future, conditional or unconditional, to acquire or dispose of\nany financial instrument, or any interest in a financial instrument, of the company.\nFinancial instruments of the company are defined as shares, warrants, and convertible\nbonds issued by the company, and any other right issued by the company to acquire\nsuch shares, warrants and convertible bonds.\nThe company’s dealing code is available on the “Investors – Shareholders’ Information” section\nof the company’s website (www.mdxhealth.com).\n32\nAppendix 1 - Deviations\nThe list below contains an overview of the provisions of the 2020 Code that are not fully complied with.\n Given the size of the company, no internal audit function exist at this time. In line with provision\n4.14 of the 2020 Code, the need for an internal audit function will be reviewed annually.\n Following the modification of the directors' remuneration on 30 July 2020, effective as from 1\nJuly 2020, the non-executive directors that are not independent directors shall not be entitled\nto a remuneration in cash, but shall each year be entitled to receive share options for a\nmaximum of 10,000 shares of the company. This is contrary to provision 7.6 of the 2020 Code,\nwhich provides that no share options should be granted to non-executive directors.

(together with its subsidiaries existing from time to\ntime, “mdxhealth” or the “Company”) established this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (as\nit may be in effect from time to time, this “Code”) to aid mdxhealth’s directors, officers and\nemployees in making ethical and legal decisions when conducting mdxhealth’s business and\nperforming their day-to-day duties.\nThe Company expects its directors, officers and employees to exercise reasonable judgment\nwhen conducting its business. The Company encourages its directors, officers and employees to\nrefer to this Code frequently to ensure that they are acting within both the letter and the spirit of\nthis Code. The Company also understands that this Code will not contain the answer to every\nsituation you may encounter or every concern you may have about conducting mdxhealth’s\nbusiness ethically and legally. For guidance with respect to issues not addressed in this Code, you\nshould follow mdxhealth’s internal policies and procedures, including mdxhealth’s Dealing\nCode, Corporate Governance Charter and any applicable mdxhealth Compliance Program,\nPrivacy or HIPAA policy and Employee Manual.\nIf you have any questions regarding this Code, you should address these questions to your\nsupervisor or to the Compliance Officer.\nContents of this Code\nThis Code has two sections that follow this Introduction. The first section, “Standards of\nConduct,” contains the actual guidelines that our directors, officers and employees are expected\nto adhere to in the conduct of mdxhealth’s business. The second section, “Compliance\nProcedures,” contains specific information about how this Code functions, including who\nadministers the Code, who can provide guidance under the Code and how violations may be\nreported, investigated and punished. This section also contains a discussion about waivers of\nand amendments to this Code.\nA Note About Other Obligations\nThis Code applies to all mdxhealth directors, officers, and employees. We refer to the members\nof mdxhealth's Board of Directors as \"directors.\" We refer to all officers and other employees\ncovered by this Code as simply \"employees,\" unless the context otherwise requires. When an\narrangement with a consultant or other service provider references the application of this Code,\nthis Code applies to and covers such consultant or other service provider in the same manner as\nan “employee”, unless the context otherwise requires. In this Code, the Company's Chief\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nPage 2\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are referred to as the Company's “principal\nfinancial officers”.\nThe Company’s directors, officers, consultants, service providers and employees generally\nhave other legal and contractual obligations to mdxhealth. This Code is not intended to reduce\nor limit the other obligations that you may have to mdxhealth. Instead, the standards in this\nCode, as it may be in effect from time to time, should be viewed as the minimum standards\nthat we expect from our directors, officers and employees in the conduct of our business.\nStandards of Conduct\nConflicts of Interest\nThe Company recognizes and respects the right of its directors, officers and employees\nto engage in outside activities which they may deem proper and desirable, provided that these\nactivities do not impair or interfere with the performance of their duties to mdxhealth or their\nability to act in mdxhealth’s best interests. In most if not all cases, this will mean that our\ndirectors, officers and employees must avoid situations that present a potential or actual conflict\nbetween their personal interests and our interests.\nA “conflict of interest” occurs when a director’s, officer’s or employee’s personal interest\ninterferes with our interests. Conflicts of interest may arise in many situations. For example,\nconflicts of interest can arise when you take an action or have an outside interest, responsibility\nor obligation that may make it difficult for you to perform the responsibilities of your position\nobjectively and/or effectively in mdxhealth’s best interests. Conflicts of interest may also occur\nwhen you or your immediate family member receives some personal benefit (whether improper\nor not) as a result of your position with mdxhealth. Each individual’s situation is different and in\nevaluating your own situation, you will have to consider many factors.\nAny material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a\nconflict of interest should be reported promptly to the Compliance Officer. The Compliance\nOfficer may notify the Board of Directors or a committee thereof as he or she deems appropriate.\nCorporate Opportunities\nEmployees, officers and directors owe a duty to mdxhealth to advance its legitimate\nbusiness interests when the opportunity to do so arises. As an employee, officer and director, you\nare prohibited from:\n• diverting to yourself or to others any opportunities that are discovered through the use\nof mdxhealth’s property or information as a result of your position with mdxhealth\nunless such opportunity has first been presented to, and rejected by, mdxhealth;\n• using mdxhealth’s property or information or your position for improper personal gain;\nor\n• competing with mdxhealth.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nPage 3\nConfidentiality\nConfidential information generated and gathered by mdxhealth plays a vital role in our\nbusiness, prospects and ability to compete. “Confidential information” includes all non-public\ninformation that might be of use to competitors or harmful to mdxhealth or its customers or\npartners if disclosed. Directors, officers and employees may not disclose or distribute\nmdxhealth’s confidential information, except when disclosure is authorized by mdxhealth or\nrequired by applicable law, rule or regulation or pursuant to an applicable legal proceeding. You\nmay use confidential information solely for legitimate mdxhealth business purposes. You must\nreturn all of mdxhealth’s confidential and/or proprietary information in your possession to\nmdxhealth when you cease to be employed by or to otherwise serve mdxhealth.\nProtection and Proper Use of mdxhealth’s Assets\nLoss, theft and misuse of mdxhealth’s assets has a direct impact on mdxhealth’s business\nand its profitability. Employees, officers and directors are expected to protect mdxhealth’s assets\nthat are entrusted to them and to protect mdxhealth’s assets in general. You are also expected to\ntake steps to ensure that mdxhealth’s assets are only used for legitimate business purposes.\nCompliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nThe Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with applicable laws, rules and\nregulations. No director, officer or employee shall engage in any unlawful activity in conducting\nmdxhealth’s business or in performing his or her day-to-day company duties, nor shall any\ndirector, officer or employee instruct others to do so.\nAnti-Kickback Laws and Regulations\nMost countries in which mdxhealth does or may do business have anti-kickback laws and\nregulations that prohibit certain payments and donations to physicians and customers, or\nany similar conduct that, directly or indirectly, is intended to induce business that is\nreimbursable under any national health care program. One set of examples is the United\nStates Anti-Kickback Statute (42 USC § 1320a-7b(b)), Stark Law (42 USC § 1395nn)\nand False Claims Act (31 USC § 3729(a)). The Company’s policy is to comply with all\nsuch laws and regulations. For guidance with respect to anti-kickback laws and\nregulations not addressed in this Code, you should refer to mdxhealth’s internal policies\nand procedures, including mdxhealth’s Compliance Program.\nDiagnostic Product Laws and Regulations\nCertain of mdxhealth's products and services are heavily regulated by governmental\nagencies, health ministries, and other regulatory authorities in the various countries in\nwhich mdxhealth does business. Every employee is responsible for compliance with\napplicable legal and regulatory requirements, including marketing approvals, conduct of\nclinical studies, design controls, labeling and advertising controls, and any other product\nregulations and controls promulgated by any such governmental agencies. Violation of\nthese laws and regulations can result in severe civil and criminal penalties, adverse\npublicity for mdxhealth, total or partial suspension of testing of an mdxhealth product,\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nPage 4\nwithdrawal of an mdxhealth product from the market, and disciplinary action by\nmdxhealth against the responsible individuals, up to and including termination of\nemployment or service. You are expected to promptly report any significant issues related\nto regulatory affairs to your supervisor or the Compliance Officer.\nAnti-Bribery Laws and Regulations\nMost countries in which mdxhealth does or may do business have laws and regulations\nthat prohibit the payment of bribes, kickbacks or other inducements to government\nofficials. One example is the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") which\nprohibits mdxhealth and its employees, directors and agents from offering or giving\nmoney or any other item of value to win or retain business or to influence any act or\ndecision of any governmental official, political party, candidate for political office or\nofficial of a public international organization. The Company’s policy is to comply with\nall such laws and regulations.\nNo payment shall be made to any government official for the purpose of influencing any\nof the official’s acts or decisions, or inducing the official to use personal influence to\naffect any governmental act or decision. “Payment” means a transfer of money, a gift, or\nan offer or promise to give anything of value, whether made directly or indirectly,\nthrough trade associations, agents, consultants, or others. “Government Official” includes\nan officer or employee or any person acting for or on behalf of a government or a\ngovernment unit.\nGovernment Interactions. If your job responsibilities include interacting with the\ngovernment, you are expected to understand and comply with the special laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to your job position as well as with any applicable standard\noperating procedures that mdxhealth has implemented. If any doubt exists about whether\na course of action is lawful, you should seek advice immediately from your supervisor\nand the Compliance Officer. In addition to the above, you must obtain approval from the\nCompliance Officer for any work activity that requires communication with any member\nor employee of a legislative body or with any government official or employee. Work\nactivities covered by this policy include meetings with legislators or members of their\nstaffs or with senior executive branch officials on behalf of mdxhealth. Preparation,\nresearch and other background activities that are done in support of lobbying\ncommunication are also covered by this policy even if the communication ultimately is\nnot made. If any doubt exists about whether a given work activity would be considered\ncovered by this provision, you should seek advice immediately from your supervisor and\nthe Compliance Officer.\nPolitical & Volunteer Activities. Directors, officers and employees may participate\nin the political process as individuals and on their own time. In all such instances, you\nshould be careful to make it clear that your views and actions are your own, and not made\non behalf of mdxhealth. For instance, mdxhealth letterhead should not be used to send out\npersonal letters in connection with political activities. The Company's facilities generally\nmay not be used for political activities (including fundraisers or other activities related to\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nPage 5\nrunning for office). It is mdxhealth policy that mdxhealth funds or assets not be used to\nmake a political contribution to any political party or candidate, unless prior approval has\nbeen given by our Chief Executive Officer, or our Board of Directors, in each case after\nconsultation with legal counsel. These guidelines are intended to ensure that any political\nactivity you pursue is done voluntarily and on your own resources and time.\nAntitrust Laws and Regulations\nAntitrust laws are designed to protect consumers and competitors against unfair business\npractices and to promote and preserve competition. Our policy is to compete vigorously\nand ethically while complying with all antitrust, monopoly, competition or cartel laws in\nall countries, states or localities in which mdxhealth conducts business. You should\npromptly consult the Compliance Officer with any questions you may have concerning\ncompliance with these laws.\nEmployees should exercise caution in meetings with competitors. Any meeting with a\ncompetitor may give rise to the appearance of impropriety. As a result, if you are required\nto meet with a competitor for any reason, you should obtain the prior approval of the\nCompliance Officer. You should try to meet with competitors in a closely monitored,\ncontrolled environment for a limited period of time. You should create and circulate\nagendas in advance of any such meetings, and the contents of your meeting should be\nfully documented. Specifically, you should avoid any communications with a competitor\nregarding prices, costs, profits and profit margins, terms and conditions of sale, market\nshare or strategies, allocation of sales territories, customers or suppliers, or other subjects\nrelating to or affecting the production or sale of products to existing or prospective\ncustomers.\nIf you participate in a meeting with a competitor in which any of the above topics are\nbroached, you should affirmatively end the discussion, and you should state your reasons\nfor doing so. During meetings with competitors, avoid sharing or obtaining confidential\ninformation from the competitor. Also avoid statements that could be construed as unfair\nacts such as harassment, threats or interference with the competitors' existing contractual\nrelationships.\nTrade Association Meetings. Employees are permitted to attend trade association\nmeetings. These include associations of customers as well as trade associations of the\nindustries in which mdxhealth is involved. However, trade association meetings are a\nfavorite area of examination by antitrust enforcement officials. It is important that\nemployees be particularly careful to conduct themselves in a manner that is above\nsuspicion when attending these meetings.\nSecurities Laws and Regulations\nDirectors, officers and employees are prohibited from engaging in insider trading. Insider\ntrading is trading in mdxhealth's securities while aware of confidential information about\nmdxhealth that could, if it became public, affect the price of such securities. Disclosure of\nany information to another person, such as a family member or friend, which would\nenable them to gain a trading benefit not available to the general public, is prohibited as\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nPage 6\nwell. Similar restrictions apply to trading in the stock of other companies using\nconfidential information that a director, officer or employee has access to because of his\nor her employment or position. This conduct is illegal and could subject any such person\nand mdxhealth to civil liability and criminal penalties. The Company’s policy is to\ncomply with all such laws and regulations. For guidance with respect to securities laws\nand regulations not addressed in this Code, you should refer to mdxhealth’s internal\npolicies and procedures, including mdxhealth’s Dealing Code.\nAnalyst, Media and Government Inquiries. The Company must be made aware of\nany inquiries from the financial analyst community, the media or the government, so that\nit can properly and thoroughly respond. If any employee of mdxhealth is contacted by a\nrepresentative of a governmental agency seeking an interview or making a non-routine\nrequest for documents, that employee should immediately contact the Compliance Officer\nso that appropriate arrangements can be made to fully comply with mdxhealth's legal\nobligation. All inquiries from the financial analyst community should be referred to\nmdxhealth's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Compliance Officer. All\nmedia inquiries should be referred to an authorized spokesperson for mdxhealth\naccording to mdxhealth's external communications policy.\nQuality of Public Disclosures. The Company is committed to providing its\nshareholders with information about its financial condition and results of operations as\nrequired by applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules. It is mdxhealth’s policy\nthat the reports and documents it files with or submits to securities and financial\nregulatory authorities and organizations, and its earnings releases and similar public\ncommunications made by mdxhealth, include fair, timely and understandable disclosure.\nOfficers and employees who are responsible for these filings and disclosures, including\nmdxhealth’s principal executive, financial and accounting officers, must use reasonable\njudgment and perform their responsibilities honestly, ethically and objectively in order to\nensure that this disclosure policy is fulfilled. The Company’s senior management is\nprimarily responsible for monitoring mdxhealth’s public disclosure.\nPatient Privacy\nAs part of its business, mdxhealth may obtain medical information and other information\nabout patients. This information can be contained in records obtained as part of a clinical study,\npatient tracking records, vigilance records, records obtained while providing technical support or\nother records. All such records and information are to be treated as confidential. Only employees\nwho need to use this information as part of their jobs are to be given access to it. In appropriate\ncircumstances and following mdxhealth procedures, such information can be shared with the\npatient, the patient’s physician (directly or through agents of the physician) and, when required,\ngovernment agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the courts. The\nCompany’s policy is to comply with all laws and regulations regarding the protection and use of\npatient information. For guidance with respect to patient privacy issues not addressed in this\nCode, you should refer to mdxhealth’s internal policies and procedures, including mdxhealth’s\nPrivacy and HIPAA Policy.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nPage 7\nAccuracy of Records\nThe integrity, reliability and accuracy in all material respects of mdxhealth’s books,\nrecords and financial statements is fundamental to mdxhealth’s continued and future business\nsuccess. No director, officer or employee may cause us to enter into a transaction with the intent\nto document or record it in a deceptive or unlawful manner. In addition, no director, officer or\nemployee may create any false or artificial documentation or book entry for any transaction\nentered into by mdxhealth. Similarly, officers and employees who have responsibility for\naccounting and financial reporting matters have a responsibility to accurately record all funds,\nassets and transactions on our books and records.\nThe Environment, Health and Safety\nThe Company is committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment for its\nemployees and to avoiding adverse impact and injury to the environment and the communities in\nwhich it does business. The Company employees, officers and directors must comply with all\napplicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and mdxhealth standards. It is your\nresponsibility to understand and comply with the laws, regulations and policies that are relevant\nto your job. Failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations can\nresult in civil and criminal liability against you and mdxhealth, as well as disciplinary action by\nmdxhealth, up to and including termination of employment. You should contact your supervisor\nor the Compliance Officer if you have any questions about the laws, regulations and policies that\napply to you.\nEnvironment\nAll mdxhealth employees, officers and directors should strive to conserve resources and\nreduce waste and emissions through recycling and other energy conservation measures.\nYou have a responsibility to promptly report any known or suspected violations of\nenvironmental laws or any events that may result in a discharge or emission of hazardous\nmaterials.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed not only to comply with all relevant health and safety laws,\nbut also to conduct business in a manner that protects the safety of its employees. All\nemployees, officers and directors are required to comply with all applicable health and\nsafety laws, regulations and policies relevant to their positions. If you have a concern\nabout unsafe conditions or tasks that present a risk of injury to you, please report these\nconcerns immediately to your supervisor, the Human Resources Department or the\nCompliance Officer.\nFair Dealing\nCompeting vigorously, yet lawfully, with competitors and establishing advantageous, but\nfair, business relationships with customers and suppliers is a part of the foundation for long-term\nsuccess. However, unlawful and unethical conduct, which may lead to short-term gains, may\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nPage 8\ndamage a company’s reputation and long-term business prospects. Accordingly, it is mdxhealth’s\npolicy that directors, officers and employees must endeavor to deal ethically and lawfully with\nmdxhealth’s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees in all business dealings on\nmdxhealth’s behalf. No director, officer or employee should take unfair advantage of another\nperson in business dealings on our behalf through the abuse of privileged or confidential\ninformation or through improper manipulation, concealment or misrepresentation of material\nfacts.\nHarassment and Discrimination\nThe Company is committed to providing equal opportunity and fair treatment to all\nindividuals on the basis of merit, without discrimination because of race, color, religion, national\norigin, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status or other\ncharacteristic protected by law. The Company also prohibits harassment based on these\ncharacteristics in any form, whether physical or verbal and whether committed by supervisors,\nnon-supervisory personnel or non-employees. Harassment may include, but is not limited to,\noffensive sexual flirtations, unwanted sexual advances or propositions, verbal abuse, sexually or\nracially degrading words, or the display in the workplace of sexually suggestive or racially\ndegrading objects or pictures. You should promptly contact the Human Resources Department or\nthe Compliance Officer if you have any questions about the laws, regulations and policies that\napply to you.\nViolence Prevention and Weapons\nPersonal safety and security are vitally important. The Company will not tolerate violence\nor threats of violence in, or related to, the workplace. If you experience, witness or otherwise\nbecome aware of a violent or potentially violent situation that occurs on the Company's property\nor affects the Company's business you must immediately report the situation to your supervisor,\nthe Human Resources Department or the Compliance Officer. The Company does not permit any\nindividual to have weapons of any kind in Company property or vehicles, while on the job or off-\nsite while on Company business. This is true even if you have obtained legal permits to carry\nweapons. The only exception to this policy applies to security personnel who are specifically\nauthorized by Company management to carry weapons. You should promptly contact the Human\nResources Department or the Compliance Officer if you have any questions about the laws,\nregulations and policies that apply to you.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nPage 9\nCompliance Procedures\nCommunication of Code\nAll directors, officers and employees will be supplied with a copy of the Code upon\nbeginning service at mdxhealth and will be asked to review and sign an acknowledgment\nregarding the Code on a periodic basis. Updates of the Code will be provided from time to time.\nA copy of the Code is also available to all directors, officers and employees by requesting one\nfrom the human resources department or by accessing our website at http://www.mdxhealth.com.\nMonitoring Compliance and Disciplinary Action\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision of its Board of Directors or a\ncommittee thereof or, in the case of accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing or\nsecurities law matters, the Audit Committee, shall take reasonable steps from time to time to (i)\nmonitor compliance with the Code, and (ii) when appropriate, impose and enforce appropriate\ndisciplinary measures for violations of the Code.\nThe Board of Directors has delegated day-to-day responsibility for administering and\ninterpreting the Code to a Compliance Officer. Our General Counsel has been appointed as our\nCompliance Officer under this Code.\nIt is mdxhealth policy that any employee, consultant, officer or director who\nviolates this Code (which would include any violation of laws, rules or regulations\napplicable to mdxhealth) will be subject to appropriate discipline, which may include\ntermination of employment, termination of service, or removal from the Board of\nDirectors, as appropriate. This determination will be based upon the facts and\ncircumstances of each particular situation.

Every employee is expected to act proactively by asking questions, seeking\nguidance and reporting suspected violations of the Code and other policies and procedures of\nmdxhealth, as well as any violation or suspected violation of applicable law, rule or regulation\narising in the conduct of mdxhealth’s business or occurring on its property. If any employee\nbelieves that actions have taken place, may be taking place, or may be about to take place\nthat violate or would violate the Code or any law, rule or regulation applicable to\nmdxhealth, he or she must bring the matter to the attention of mdxhealth.\nSeeking Guidance. The best starting point for seeking advice on ethics-related issues or\nreporting potential violations of the Code will usually be your supervisor. However, if the\nconduct in question involves your supervisor, if you have reported the conduct in question to\nyour supervisor and do not believe that he or she has dealt with it properly, or if you do not\nfeel that you can discuss the matter with your supervisor, you may raise the matter with the\nCompliance Officer.\nYou may also report known or suspected violations of the Code on the Compliance\nHotline that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at [redacted text]. You may remain\nanonymous and will not be required to reveal your identity in calls to the Compliance Hotline,\nalthough providing your identity may assist mdxhealth in investigating your concern. All\nreports of known or suspected violations of the law or this Code will be handled sensitively\nand with discretion. Your supervisor, the Compliance Officer and mdxhealth will protect your\nconfidentiality to the extent possible, consistent with applicable laws and mdxhealth's need to\ninvestigate your concern.\nCommunication Alternatives.

However, we also\nrecognize that some people may feel more comfortable reporting a suspected violation\nanonymously.\nIf you wish to remain anonymous, you may do so, and mdxhealth will use reasonable\nefforts to protect the confidentiality of the reporting person subject to applicable law, rule or\nregulation or to any applicable legal proceedings. In the event the report is made anonymously,\nhowever, mdxhealth may not have sufficient information to look into or otherwise investigate\nor evaluate the allegations. Accordingly, persons who make reports anonymously should\nprovide as much detail as possible to permit mdxhealth to evaluate the matter(s) set forth in the\nanonymous report and, if appropriate, commence and conduct an appropriate investigation.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nPage 12\nNo Retaliation\nThe Company expressly forbids any retaliation against any director, officer or employee\nwho, acting in good faith on the basis of a reasonable belief, reports suspected misconduct.\nSpecifically, mdxhealth will not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass or in any other\nmanner discriminate against, an employee in the terms and conditions of his or her employment.\nAny person who participates in any such retaliation is subject to disciplinary action, including\ntermination.\nWaivers and Amendments\nAny waiver of this Code for our directors or executive officers (including our\nprincipal financial officers) may be made only by the Board of Directors and will be\ndisclosed to the public as required by law or under applicable listing rules.

          "content": "Insider Trading Policy\nDecember 15, 2023\nMDxHealth S.A. (the “Company”) has adopted this Insider Trading Policy (as it may be in effect from time to time,\nthis “Policy”) to promote compliance with federal and international securities laws by directors, officers, employees\nand consultants of the Company and its affiliates, as well as any immediate family members sharing the household\nof any of the foregoing, and any entities controlled by any of the foregoing persons, including corporations,\npartnerships or trusts (collectively, “Company Personnel”). This Policy also is designed to protect an important\ncorporate asset: the Company’s reputation for integrity and ethical conduct. This Policy governs transactions in\nsecurities of the Company or any other issuer where conflicts of interest could arise. As a result of applicable\nsecurities laws and this Policy, Company Personnel may, from time to time, have to forego or delay a desired\nsecurities transaction, and may suffer economic loss or forego anticipated profit as a result.\nPOLICY\nNo Company Personnel may trade in the Company’s securities unless certain that he or she does not possess\nmaterial inside information. No Company Personnel may disclose, or “tip,” such information to others who might\nuse it for trading, might pass it along to others who might trade, or might use it for any other improper purpose.\nSimilarly, Company Personnel may not purchase or sell, offer to purchase or sell, or otherwise trade in securities\nof any other company unless they are certain that they do not possess any material inside information about that\ncompany which they obtained in the course of their employment or consulting relationship with the Company,\nsuch as information about a major contract or merger being negotiated. No Company Personnel may “tip” such\ninformation to others who might use it for trading or might pass it along to others who might trade, or otherwise\npotentially use it for any improper purpose.\nCovered Persons (as defined below) must “pre-clear” all trading in Company securities in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth below in the section entitled “Pre-Clearance of Securities Transactions.”\nInside information relating to the Company is the property of the Company, and the unauthorized disclosure of\nsuch information is prohibited.\nThe Company’s General Counsel (or his/her designee) shall have the authority to administer and interpret this\nPolicy.\nAll Company Personnel will be required to undergo periodic training regarding this Policy, and to certify that they\nhave read, understand, and will abide by the terms of this Policy as it may be in effect from time to time.\nDEFINITIONS\n“Covered Persons” include (1) all members of the Company’s Board of Directors, (2) all personnel at the level of\nVice President or above, (3) all executive officers, (4) any other Company Personnel as determined from time to\ntime by the General Counsel and notified in writing (including via email), and (5) any immediate family members\nsharing the household of any of the foregoing.\n“non-public information” or “inside information”, means information that has not yet become publicly available or\ndisseminated to the public. The test of whether information is non-public is fact-based and depends on the specific\ncircumstances involved. For example, the fact that information has been disclosed to a few members of the public\ndoes not make it public for insider trading purposes. Release of information to the media does not immediately\nfree Company Personnel to trade. To be “public” the information must have been disseminated in a manner\ndesigned to reach investors generally. Further, information that has been released may not mean that the\ninformation is “non-public.” Company Personnel should refrain from trading until the market has had an\nopportunity to absorb and evaluate the information. If the information has been widely disseminated, it is usually\nsufficient to wait at least 24 hours after publication before trading. If you are not sure whether information is\nconsidered public, you should either consult with the General Counsel or assume that the information is non-\npublic and treat it as confidential.\n“securities” include any type of stock, share, limited partnership interest, or bond, debt or other fixed income\ninstrument issued by a business, organization or government agency or instrumentality. It also includes buying,\nselling or writing an option or some other instrument that derives its value from another security, such as put and\ncall options and convertible debentures or preferred stock, as well as debt securities such as bonds and notes.\n“trading” includes buying or selling or any other transaction involving publicly-traded securities (such as “shorting”\na stock). It does not include purchasing stock under an employee option or making a gift that does not satisfy a\nlegal obligation. It does not include previously created 10b5-1 plans, for example, as discussed below.\n“material information” is any information relating to a company, its business operations or securities, the public\ndissemination of which would be likely to affect the market price of any of its securities, or which would be likely\nto be considered important by a reasonable investor in determining whether to buy, sell or hold such securities.\nWhile it is not possible to list all types of information which might be considered material under particular\ncircumstances, information concerning the following subjects are particularly likely to be found material:\n• earnings;\n• unexpected financial results;\n• major new discoveries or advances in research;\n• acquisitions, including mergers and tender offers;\n• sales of substantial assets;\n• financings or restructurings;\n• an extraordinary item for accounting purposes, including:\no changes in debt ratings;\no significant write-downs of assets;\no additions to reserves for bad debts or contingent liabilities;\no liquidity problems;\n• extraordinary management developments;\n• dividends;\n• public or private offerings of securities;\n• major price or marketing changes for products;\n• labor negotiations;\n• threatened or actual significant litigation or investigations by government authorities, cybersecurity\nattacks, breaches or similar events;\n• awards or losses of significant contracts; and\n• receipt or denial of licenses or regulatory approvals of products or rates.\nThe information may be positive or negative. Material information is not limited to historical facts but may also\ninclude projections and forecasts. The public, the media, and the courts may use hindsight in judging what is\nmaterial. When in doubt about whether particular inside information is material, you should presume it is material\nand consult with the General Counsel.\nADDITIONAL PROHIBITIONS AND GUIDANCE\nShort Sales and Derivatives.\nShort sales of the Company’s securities (a sale of securities which are not then owned), including a “sale against\nthe box” (a sale with delayed delivery) are prohibited.\n2\nM dxh ver 202312\nNo Company Personnel may ever engage in transactions in publicly traded options, such as puts, calls and other\nderivative securities, relating to the Company. This prohibition also extends to various forms of hedging\ntransactions or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts, as they involve\nthe establishment of a short position in the Company’s securities. This prohibition does not prevent employees\nfrom exercising company-issued options, subject to the other restrictions of this Policy.\nStanding Orders\nStanding orders (except standing orders under approved Rule 10b5-1 plans, see below) should be used only for\na brief period of time. The problem with purchases or sales resulting from standing instructions to a broker is that\nthere is no control over the timing of the transaction. The broker could execute a transaction when you are in\npossession of material inside information.\nMargin Accounts and Pledges\nSecurities held in a margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer’s consent if the customer fails\nto meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower\ndefaults on the loan or, in many instances, if the value of the collateral declines. Because a margin sale or\nforeclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material inside information regarding the\nCompany, Company Personnel are prohibited from holding securities of the Company in a margin account or\npledging such securities as collateral for a loan. An exception to this prohibition may be permitted in certain limited\ncircumstances with the advance written approval of the Company’s General Counsel (or his/her designee).\n10b5-1 Plans\nRule 10b5-1 provides a defense from insider trading liability under SEC Rule 10b-5. To be eligible for this defense,\nCompany Personnel may enter into a “10b5-1 plan” for trading in the Company’s stock. If the plan meets the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1, the Company’s stock may be purchased or sold without regard to certain insider\ntrading restrictions.\nTo comply with this Policy, a 10b5-1 plan must be approved by the General Counsel (or his/her designee) and\nmeet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1.\nIn general, a 10b5-1 plan must be entered into at a time when there is no undisclosed material information. Once\nthe plan is adopted, Company Personnel must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be\ntraded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade. The plan must either specify the amount,\npricing and timing of transactions in advance or delegate discretion on these matters to an independent third party.\nInternet and Social Media\nBecause of the potential for abuse of the prohibition on “tipping,” Company Personnel are prohibited from posting\nany information on Internet chat rooms, social media or other types of public forums where the Company or the\nCompany’s securities are a topic.\nBLACKOUT POLICY\nAs part of this Policy, the Company has adopted a blackout policy that prohibits trading in the Company’s securities\nby officers, directors and certain employees and/or consultants, beginning on the day that is seven (7) calendar\ndays prior to the last day of each fiscal quarter and ending 48 hours after earnings for such quarter are publicly\nreleased.\nWho is covered by this blackout policy?\n• All Company Personnel.\n3\nM dxh ver 202312\nWhat transactions are prohibited during a blackout period?\n• Open market purchase or sale of the Company’s securities;\n• Purchase or sale of the Company’s securities through a broker; and\n• Exercise of stock options where all or a portion of the acquired stock is sold during the blackout\nperiod.\nWhat transactions are allowed during a blackout period?\n• Exercise of stock options where no Company stock is sold in the market to fund the option exercise;\n• Gifts of Company stock;\n• Transfers of Company stock to or from a trust; and\n• Transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans approved by the General Counsel (or his/her designee)\nin accordance with this Policy.\nIn addition to the standard end-of-quarter blackout periods, the Company may, from time to time, impose other\nblackout periods upon notice to those persons who are affected. The scope of persons affected may be broader\nthan, or different from, the persons described above.\nAs an aid to implementation of this Policy, during blackout periods the Company may utilize available procedures\nto restrict prohibited actions on any equity award administration website made available to employees.\nPRE-CLEARANCE OF SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS\nAll Covered Persons are obligated to pre-clear transactions in the Company’s securities. These transactions\ninclude all transactions noted above as being prohibited during a blackout period. Pre-clearance is not required\nfor the trading of securities under an approved 10b5-1 plan.\nWho authorizes the pre-clearance?\n• The General Counsel (or his/her designee); or\n• The Chief Financial Officer, in the event the General Counsel is seeking pre-clearance.\nHow does a Covered Person request pre-clearance?\n• The General Counsel (or his/her designee) will implement and maintain processes for requesting\npre-clearance\n• A Covered Person requesting pre-clearance may be required to certify that he or she is not in\npossession of material nonpublic information\nPre-clearance authorization generally is good for up to five (5) days, unless you come into contact with material\ninside information during that time or if the authorization is designated for a shorter period. If the transaction does\nnot occur during such authorization period, pre-clearance of the transaction must be re-requested. The pre-\nclearance authorization decision, whether approved or denied, shall be final and shall be kept confidential by the\nrequestor.\nPOST-TERMINATION TRANSACTIONS\nApplicable securities laws continue to apply to transactions in Company securities even after service with the\nCompany has ended. Company Personnel in possession of material non-public information at the time of their\ntermination, may not purchase or sell Company securities until that information has become public or is no longer\nmaterial.\n4\nM dxh ver 202312\nSECTION 16 REPORTS\nSome officers and all of the Company’s directors may be obligated to file Section 16 reports when they engage in\ntransactions in the Company’s securities. Although the General Counsel’s office may assist reporting persons in\npreparing and filing the required reports, the reporting persons retain responsibility for the reports.\nWho may be obligated to file Section 16 reports?\n• the Company’s directors; and\n• the Company’s officers designated as “executive officers” for SEC reporting purposes by the Board\nof Directors.\nFORM 144 REPORTS\nThe Company’s directors and certain officers designated by the Board of Directors are required to file Form 144\nbefore making an open market sale of the Company’s securities. Form 144 notifies the SEC of your intent to sell\nthe Company’s securities. This form is generally prepared and filed by your broker and is in addition to the Section\n16 reports that may be filed on your behalf by the Company.\nINDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY\nEach individual is responsible for making sure that he or she complies with this Policy, and that any family member,\nhousehold member or entity whose transactions are subject to this Policy also complies with this Policy. In all\ncases, the responsibility for determining whether an individual is in possession of material inside information rests\nwith that individual, and any action on the part of the Company, the General Counsel (or his/her designee) or any\nother Company employee or service provider pursuant to this Policy (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute\nlegal advice or insulate an individual from liability under applicable securities laws. Trading in the Company’s\nsecurities during the trading window should not be considered a “safe harbor,” and all Company Personnel should\nuse good judgment at all times.\nPENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE\nPenalties under the SEC for violations of insider trading laws, which prohibit trading on material inside information,\napply to both the individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers and supervisors, and include:\n(1) imprisonment, (2) criminal fines, (3) civil penalties, (4) prejudgment interest, and (5) private party damages. In\naddition, violation of this Policy could result in termination or other disciplinary action. Given the severity of the\npotential penalties, compliance with this Policy is absolutely mandatory. If you have questions regarding any of\nthe provisions of this Policy, please contact the General Counsel.\nCERTIFICATION\nFrom time to time, all Company Personnel will be required to certify that they have received and read a copy of\nthis Policy and to certify compliance with it. In the event that an individual fails to make such a certification, the\nCompany, in its discretion, may request information or documentation, including records relating to securities\ntrading, or take such other action as it may deem appropriate to assure compliance with this Policy.\n5\nM dxh ver 202312\nMDxHealth S.A.\nAcknowledgement Regarding Insider Trading Policy\nThe undersigned director, officer, employee, contractor or consultant of MDxHealth S.A.
