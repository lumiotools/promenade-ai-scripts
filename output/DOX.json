The year closed with strong sales momentum which included a significant award to deploy our next-gen monetization platform for a major US customer, and new cloud migration deals with Vodafone Italy and NTT Infranet in Japan. Additionally, we have continued to enhance our generative AI platform, amAIz, with new capabilities that leverage NVIDIA AI to deliver immersive customer experiences with real-time interaction and visualization,\" said Shuky Sheffer, president and chief executive officer of Amdocs Management Limited.\n\n\"Consistent with our full year guidance, we delivered accelerated profitability improvement in fiscal 2024 as we focused on operational excellence and the benefits of automation and artificial intelligence to drive internal efficiency. We continue to invest in our strategic priorities, while at the same time optimizing the portfolio of products, services, and business activities. Thus, in fiscal 2025, we are phasing out several low-margin, non-core business activities that are becoming commoditized and hold little potential for long-term value addition or profitability enhancement. We believe these actions will reinforce our level of business visibility, including a higher share of revenue from long-term managed services engagements. This move is also expected to sharpen our focus on higher-margin strategic priorities like cloud, monetization platforms and Gen AI where we are well placed to lead the communications industry through our commitment to innovation,\" said Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, chief financial officer & chief operating officer of Amdocs Management Limited.\n\nSheffer concluded, \"We enter fiscal 2025 as an industry leader with a unique competitive position, strong 12-month backlog visibility, and a high win rate. Moreover, we believe Amdocs is well positioned to monetize a healthy pipeline of market opportunities while navigating a continuously challenging demand environment. Adjusting for the phase out of several low-margin, non-core business activities, we expect pro forma(2) revenue growth of between 1% to 4.5% in constant currency(1) in fiscal 2025, as well as another year of double-digit growth in cloud. We also anticipate significantly higher operating profitability and robust earnings to cash conversion, underpinning the delivery of double-digit expected total shareholder returns(3) for the fifth consecutive year, including our dividend yield.\"\n\n**Revenue**\n\n_(All comparisons are against the prior year period)_\n\n**In millions**  \n---  \n**Three months ended** |  **Twelve months ended**  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2024**  \n**Actual** |  **Previous****Guidance** |  **Actual** |  **Previous****Guidance**  \nRevenue |  $ |  1,264 |  $ 1,240-$1,280 |  $ |  5,005 |  -  \nRevenue Growth, as reported |  1.7% |  - |  2.4% |  1.9%-2.7%  \nRevenue Growth, constant currency (1) |  2.1% |  - |  2.7% |  2.3%-3.1%  \n  \n  * Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 was slightly above the midpoint of Amdocs' guidance, adjusting for positive impact from foreign currency movements of approximately $3 million relative to our guidance assumptions and relative to the third quarter of fiscal 2024\n\n  * Revenue for the full year fiscal 2024 includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements of approximately 0.3% year-over-year\n\n\n\n\n**Net Income and Earnings Per Share**\n\n**In thousands, expect per share data**  \n---  \n**Three months ended** |  **Twelve months ended**  \n**September 30 ,** |  **September 30 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**GAAP Measures**  \nNet Income |  $ |  87,176 |  $ |  102,666 |  $ |  496,321 |  $ |  542,962  \nNet Income attributable to Amdocs Limited |  $ |  86,441 |  $ |  102,011 |  $ |  493,197 |  $ |  540,709  \nDiluted earnings per share |  $ |  0.76 |  $ |  0.86 |  $ |  4.25 |  $ |  4.49  \n**Non-GAAP Measures**  \nNon-GAAP Net Income |  $ |  195,668 |  $ |  169,009 |  $ |  750,928 |  $ |  714,454  \nNon-GAAP Net Income attributable to Amdocs Limited |  $ |  194,933 |  $ |  168,354 |  $ |  747,804 |  $ |  712,201  \nNon-GAAP Diluted earnings per share |  $ |  1.70 |  $ |  1.42 |  $ |  6.44 |  $ |  5.91  \n  \n  * Non-GAAP net income excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, changes in certain acquisition related liabilities measured at fair value, equity-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges, and other, net of related tax effects.

Presentation slides will be available shortly before the webcast.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** This release includes non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and other non-GAAP financial measures, including free cash flow, revenue on a constant currency(1) basis, non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP interest and other expenses, net, non-GAAP income taxes, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to Amdocs Limited and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth. These other non-GAAP measures exclude the following items:\n\n  * amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs;\n\n  * changes in certain acquisition-related liabilities measured at fair value;\n\n  * restructuring and unusual charges or benefits;\n\n  * equity-based compensation expense;\n\n  * other; and\n\n  * tax effects related to the above.\n\n\n\n\nFree cash flow equals cash generated by operating activities less net capital expenditures and other. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Amdocs believes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Amdocs' results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Amdocs' results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\n\nAmdocs believes that the presentation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and other financial measures, including free cash flow(5), revenue on a constant currency(1) basis, non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP interest and other expenses, net, non-GAAP income taxes, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to Amdocs Limited and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the net amount of cash generated by its business operations after taking into account capital spending required to maintain or expand the business.\n\nFor its internal budgeting process and in monitoring the results of the business, Amdocs' management uses financial statements that do not include amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, changes in certain acquisition-related liabilities measured at fair value, restructuring and unusual charges or benefits, equity-based compensation expense, other and related tax effects. Amdocs' management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Amdocs. In addition, Amdocs believes that significant groups of investors exclude these items in reviewing its results and those of its competitors, because the amounts of the items between companies can vary greatly depending on the assumptions used by an individual company in determining the amounts of the items.\n\nAmdocs further believes that, where the adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are based on specific, identified amounts that impact different line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income (including cost of revenue, research and development, selling, general and administrative, operating income, interest and other expenses, net, income taxes and net income), it is useful to investors to understand how these specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income are affected by these adjustments.
