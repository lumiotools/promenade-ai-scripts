The bid is the highest amount that a buyer is currently willing to pay, whereas the ask is the lowest amount that a seller is currently willing to sell. The numbers next to the bid/ask are the “[ _size_](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/s/size)”. The bid size displays the total amount of desired shares ...

The data displayed in the quote bar updates every 3 seconds; allowing you to monitor prices in real-time. The [ _bid-ask spread_](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/b/bid-asked-spread) can indicate a stock’s liquidity, which is how easy it is to buy and sell in the marketplace. Often, a smaller spread suggests higher liquidity, meaning more buyers and sellers in the market are willing to negotiate. In contrast, a larger spread suggests lower liquidity, as there are fewer investors willing to negotiate. You can use the bid-ask spread to determine whether to place a [_market order_](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/m/market-order) or [ _limit order_](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/l/limit-order) when trading, helping you to optimize your price and have a successful order execution.
