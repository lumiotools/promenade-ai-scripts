A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release._\n\n**Financial Results for Fiscal Q1 Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * Revenue was $181.9 million, an increase of 12.8% from the prior quarter and an increase of 0.7% from the same quarter last year. \n  * GAAP gross margin was 24.5%, down from 25.7% in the prior quarter and down from 28.2% in the same quarter last year. \n  * Non-GAAP gross margin was 25.5%, down from 26.4% in the prior quarter and down from 28.8% in the same quarter last year. \n  * GAAP operating expenses were $44.8 million, up from $42.9 million in the prior quarter and up from $41.5 million in the same quarter last year. \n  * Non-GAAP operating expenses were $38.5 million, down from $39.3 million from last quarter and down from $40.8 million in the same quarter last year. \n  * GAAP operating loss was $0.3 million, down $1.5 million of operating loss in the prior quarter and down from $9.4 million of operating income in the same quarter last year. \n  * Non-GAAP operating income was $7.8 million as compared to $3.2 million of operating income for the prior quarter and $11.2 million of operating income for the same quarter last year. \n  * GAAP net loss per diluted share was $0.09, compared to $0.09 net loss per share for the prior quarter, and $0.19 net income per share for the same quarter a year ago. \n  * Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.21, compared to $0.09 net income per share for the prior quarter and 0.33 net income per share for the same quarter a year ago. \n  * Consolidated cash flow provided by operating activities was $11.0 million, as compared to $7.1 million of cash flow provided by operating activities in the prior quarter. \n  * The Company closed the quarter with $176.0 million of cash and cash equivalents. \n\n\n\nAOS Chief Executive Officer Stephen Chang commented, “Our fiscal Q1 results were in-line with our revenue and EPS guidance driven by sequential growth in each of our major segments. We saw seasonal strength from smartphones, computing, tablets, gaming, and wearables.\" \n\nMr. Chang concluded, “Looking into the rest of calendar year 2024, we anticipate a typical seasonal decline in notebooks and smartphones that will lead to a sequential decrease in December quarter revenue. However, we expect slight sequential growth in our Computing and Industrial segments—driven by strength in desktops, graphics cards, and quick chargers—to help partially offset this decline. Looking into next year, although visibility is limited, our strategic transition from a component supplier to a total solutions provider with a diverse product portfolio and premier customer base positions us well to outperform the broader markets we serve.\" \n\n**Business Outlook for Fiscal Q2 Ending December 31, 2024**\n\n_The following statements are based on management’s current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. AOS undertakes no obligation to update these statements._\n\nOur expectations for the fiscal second quarter of year 2025 are as follows: \n\n  * Revenue to be approximately $170 million, plus or minus $10 million. \n  * GAAP gross margin to be 24%, plus or minus 1%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be 25%, plus or minus 1%. \n  * GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $45 million, plus or minus $1 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $38.8 million, plus or minus $1 million. \n  * Interest expense to be approximately equal to interest income, and \n  * Income tax expense to be in the range of $1 million to $1.2 million. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nAOS plans to hold an investor teleconference and live webcast to discuss the financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2024 today, November 4, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.

These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, market trends in the semiconductor industry and growth in calendar year 2024, our ability to outperform market, seasonality of our business, our ability to pursue new opportunities, our projected amount of revenue, gross margin, operating income (loss), income tax expenses, net income (loss), and share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax expenses, our ability to grow our sales and market share, and other information under the section entitled “Business Outlook for Fiscal Q2 Ending December 31, 2024.” Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the state of semiconductor industry and seasonality of our markets; decline of PC markets; our lack of control over the joint venture in China; difficulties and challenges in executing our diversification strategy into different market segments; ordering pattern from distributors and seasonality; changes in regulatory environment and government investigation; our ability to introduce or develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance; government policies on our business operations in China; the actual product performance in volume production; the quality and reliability of our product, our ability to achieve design wins; the general business and economic conditions; our ability to maintain factory utilization at a desirable level; and other risks as described in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 filed by AOS with the SEC and other periodic reports we filed with the SEC. Other unknown or unpredictable factors or underlying assumptions subsequently proving to be incorrect could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance, or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All information provided in this press release is as of today’s date, unless otherwise stated, and AOS undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures for our historical performance, including non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income (loss), net income (loss), diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) and EBITDAS. These supplemental measures exclude, among other items, share-based compensation expenses, legal and professional fees related to government investigation, amortization of purchased intangible, income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and equity method investment loss from equity investee. We also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in our guidance for the next quarter, including non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses. We believe that these historical and forecast non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items and expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results or do not reflect our normal business operations. In addition, our management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and to benchmark our performance externally against competitors. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that such non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as non-GAAP net income (loss) or non-GAAP operating expenses, do not have a standardized meaning. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. In addition, we included the amount of income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments in the non-GAAP net income (loss) of reconciliation table for all periods presented as the management believes that such non-GAAP presentation provides useful information to investors, even though the amounts are not significant. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures both in the text in this press release and in the tables attached hereto. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. \n\n**About Alpha and Omega Semiconductor**\n\nAlpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited, or AOS, is a designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of discrete power devices, wide band gap power devices, power management ICs, and modules, including a wide portfolio of Power MOSFET, SiC, IGBT, IPM, TVS, HV Gate Drivers, Power IC, and Digital Power products.

          "content": "Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited\nPrepared Remarks for the Investor Conference Call\nfor the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024\nNovember 4, 2024\nSteven Pelayo\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alpha and Omega Semiconductor’s conference call\nto discuss fiscal 2025 first quarter financial results. I am Steven Pelayo, Investor Relations\nrepresentative for AOS. With me today are Stephen Chang, our CEO, and Yifan Liang, our CFO.\nThis call is being recorded and broadcast live over the Web. A replay will be available for seven\ndays following the call via the link in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nOur call will proceed as follows today. Stephen will begin business updates including strategic\nhighlights, and a detailed segment report. After that, Yifan will review the financial results and\nprovide guidance for the December quarter. Finally, we will have the Q&A session.\nThe earnings release was distributed over wire today, November 4, 2024, after the market close.\nThe release is also posted on the company's website. Our earnings release and this presentation\ninclude non-GAAP financial measures. We use non-GAAP measures because we believe they\nprovide useful information about our operating performance that should be considered by\ninvestors in conjunction with the GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures\nto comparable GAAP measures is included in the earnings release.\nWe remind you that during this conference call, we will make certain forward-looking statements,\nincluding discussions of the business outlook and financial projections. These forward-looking\nstatements are based on management's current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties\nthat could cause our actual results to differ materially. For a more detailed description of these\nrisks and uncertainties, please refer to our recent and subsequent filings with the SEC. We\nassume no obligations to update the information provided in today's call.\nNow, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Stephen Chang. Stephen?\nQ1 FY2025 Page 1\nStephen Chang\nThank you, Steven. Welcome to Alpha and Omega’s fiscal Q1 earnings call. I will begin with a\nhigh-level overview of our results and then jump into segment details.\nWe delivered fiscal Q1 revenue and EPS results in-line with our guidance. Revenue was $181.9\nmillion, non-GAAP gross margin was 25.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.21.\nWe saw broad-based demand due to seasonality in the September quarter with sequential growth\nin each of our major segments. Relative strength came from PC desktops, notebooks and servers\nin our Computing segment; gaming and wearables within Consumer; strong growth from a Tier 1\nUS smartphone customer within Communications; and AC-DC power supplies and quick chargers\nin the Power Supply and Industrial segment.\nWe have delivered on our commitments and continue to make unwavering strides to transform\nfrom a component supplier to a total solutions provider, leveraging strengths in high-performance\nsilicon, packaging, and intelligent ICs. We aim to capture market share and increase BOM content\nwith a broader portfolio. For example, we are leveraging our strength in graphics cards and\nintroducing new Vcore products for opportunities in advanced computing and A.I. datacenters. In\nsmartphones, trends like foldable screens, AI integration, and faster charging offer growth\nopportunities. In addition to Computing and Communication, we see long term potential in solar,\ne-mobility, gaming, and home appliances, all driven by the global push for efficient, sustainable\nenergy solutions.\nWith that, let me now cover our segment results and provide some guidance by segment for the\nnext quarter.\nStarting with Computing. September quarter revenue was up 8.6% year-over-year and 6.6%\nsequentially and represented 42.0% of total revenue. These results were slightly better than our\noriginal expectation for mid-single digit growth. As mentioned before, we saw relative strength\nfrom PC desktops, notebooks, and servers, which was offset by softer graphics and A.I.-\naccelerator cards due to a pause before the next platform transition.\nWe are increasingly confident in our position in advanced computing. Our backlog for both\ngraphics cards and A.I. accelerator cards is now growing due to the new platform transition. At\nthis stage, we are working closely with add-in card makers in Asia as they bring up their boards\nand prepare for mass production. With the new platform, we expect BOM content to increase as\nmore power stage ICs, paired with our controller, are being used to power the GPU.\nThese design wins highlight the strength of our customer relationships and our total solutions\napproach as we supply both the controller and power stages. Additionally, we are collaborating\nQ1 FY2025 Page 2\nwith customers on larger data center opportunities slated for 2025. We anticipate having more to\ntalk about with these developments during our next earnings report.\nLooking forward into the December quarter, the PC market is expected to decline with seasonality,\nbut we expect the Computing segment to slightly grow sequentially with share gains in desktops,\nas well as strength in graphics cards and servers, offset by notebook and tablet market\nseasonality.\nTurning to the Consumer segment, September quarter revenue was up 2.0% year-over-year\nand 12.4% sequentially and represented 17.4% of total revenue. The results were in-line with our\nforecast for low double digit sequential growth and were primarily driven by gaming, wearables,\nand TVs, offset by a decline in home appliances. This was the second quarter of sequential\ngrowth in gaming, so we are confident the inventory correction is now behind us. However, we\ndon’t expect meaningful growth until the customer transitions to the next platform. Wearables\nwere a notable standout in the quarter reaching record levels on market share gains and new\nversions of smartwatches and headphones.\nFor the December quarter, we forecast close to a 30% sequential decline in the consumer\nsegment driven by seasonal decline in gaming and TVs, post new product launch impacts in\nwearables, and continued softness in home appliances.\nNext, let’s discuss the Communications segment, revenue in the September quarter was up\n14.2% year-over-year and 29.4% sequentially, and represented 19.5% of total revenue. These\nresults were above our double-digit sequential growth expectations as our Tier 1 U.S. smartphone\ncustomer prepared for its product launch. In some of their high-end models we are seeing an\nincrease in BOM content as they are moving toward a higher charging current. We also saw\nstrong sequential growth from China OEMs offset by sequential declines from Korea. As\nmentioned last quarter, we are benefiting from a mix shift to more premium phones.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate a low double-digit sequential decline in the December quarter due\nto seasonality and overall limited visibility on smartphone sell through heading into next year.\nNow, let’s talk about our last segment, Power Supply and Industrial, which accounted for\n17.5% of total revenue and was down 23.7% year-over-year, but up 15.6% sequentially. The\nresults were at the low-end of our forecast for 15-20% sequential growth, but were still driven by\nseasonal strength in AC-DC power supplies and quick chargers.\nWithin Industrial, solar remains soft, while the recovery in quick chargers has now started. We\nsee additional opportunities in 2025 for quick chargers due to increased BOM content driven by\nhigher charging currents. We also are leveraging relationships in Taiwan to partner on DC fans\nfor server racks.\nQ1 FY2025 Page 3\nFor the December quarter, we expect the Power Supply and Industrial segment to grow low single\ndigits sequentially primarily driven by e-mobility and continued growth from quick chargers. This\ngrowth will be partially offset by a seasonal decline in AC-DC power supplies.\nIn closing, the September quarter was in-line with our expectations. The broad-based growth\nconfirms the inventory corrections we experienced over the past year are complete. Seasonality\nhas returned and new markets like A.I. and advanced computing are emerging. We expect a\ntypical seasonal decline in the December quarter primarily driven by notebook, tablets, gaming,\nwearables and TV, but partially offset by desktops, graphics cards, servers, e-mobility and quick\nchargers.\nAt this point, our visibility into 2025 is limited and the calendar first quarter of 2025 is typically\nseasonally soft as well. However, we are optimistic and poised for growth, bolstered by advanced\ntechnology, a diversified product portfolio addressing a broadening array of end markets, and a\npremier customer base across all business lines. We are steadfast in executing our technology\nroadmap.\nWe are excited about our transition from a component supplier to a total solutions provider. These\nstrategic efforts over the past few years are starting to bear fruit as evidenced by our success in\ndesigning in both controllers, as well as power stages, into PCs, graphics cards, and now\nexpanding into A.I. applications. This transition will only accelerate going forward as we tap into\nnew opportunities and increase our share of BOM content.\nIn summary, power management underpins key trends such as A.I., digitalization, connectivity,\nand electrification – especially as we move towards a sustainable, low-carbon society. We see\nmany future opportunities in advanced computing and data centers, increasing integration of A.I.\nin PCs and smartphones, and higher smartphone charging currents with multiple batteries and\nscreens. Beyond Computing and Communication segments, we remain optimistic on the\nunderlying power trends in adjacent markets such as solar, motors and e-mobility, gaming, home\nappliances and power tools.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Yifan for a discussion of our fiscal first quarter financial\nresults and our outlook for the next quarter. Yifan?\nYifan Liang (Chief Financial Officer)\nThank you, Stephen. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us.\nRevenue for the quarter was $181.9 million, up 12.8% sequentially and 0.7% year-over-year.\nIn terms of product mix, DMOS revenue was $122.5 million, up 20.0% sequentially and 0.8% over\nlast year. Power IC revenue was $52.9 million, up 0.4% from the prior quarter and from a year\nago. Assembly service and other revenue was $0.9 million, as compared to $1.4 million last\nQ1 FY2025 Page 4\nquarter and $0.7 million for the same quarter last year. License and engineering service revenue\nwas $5.6 million for the quarter versus $5.1 million in the prior quarter and $5.6 million for the\nsame quarter a year ago.\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 25.5%, compared to 26.4% last quarter and 28.8% a year ago. The\nquarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly impacted by ASP erosion and mix changes.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $38.5 million, compared to $39.3 million for the prior quarter\nand $40.8 million last year. The slight quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to lower\nprofessional fees and fluctuation of engineering expenses.\nNon-GAAP quarterly EPS was $0.21, compared to $0.09 per share last quarter and $0.33 per\nshare a year ago.\nMoving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $11.0 million, including $8.4 million of\nrepayment of customer deposits. By comparison, operating cash flow was $7.1 million in the prior\nquarter and $13.8 million last year. We expect to refund $5.8 million customer deposits in the\nDecember quarter. EBITDAS for the quarter was $20.6 million, compared to $16.0 million last\nquarter and $23.3 million for the same quarter a year ago.\nNow let me turn to our balance sheet.\nWe completed the September quarter with a cash balance of $176.0 million, compared to $175.1\nmillion at the end of last quarter.\nNet trade receivables increased by $12.0 million sequentially. Days Sales Outstanding were 15\ndays for the quarter, compared to 12 days for the prior quarter.\nNet inventory decreased by $10.8 million quarter-over-quarter. Average days in inventory were\n125 days, compared to 148 days in the last quarter.\nCapEx for the quarter was $6.7 million, compared to $7.2 million for the prior quarter. We expect\nCapEx for the December quarter to range from $6 million to $8 million.\nNow, I would like to discuss December quarter guidance.\nWe expect:\n• Revenue to be approximately $170 million, plus or minus $10 million.\n• GAAP gross margin to be 24%, plus or minus 1%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin\nto be 25%, plus or minus 1%.\nQ1 FY2025 Page 5\n• GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $45 million, plus or minus $1 million. Non-\nGAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $38.8 million, plus or minus\n$1 million.\n• Interest expense to be approximately equal to interest income, and\n• Income tax expense to be in the range of $1 million to $1.2 million.\nWith that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, please start the Q&A session.\nClosing:\nThis concludes our earnings call today. Thank you for your interest in AOS and we look forward\nto talking to you again next quarter.\nSpecial Notes Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThis script contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates,\nforecasts and projections of future performance based on management's judgment, beliefs, current trends,\nand anticipated product performance.

The Company and Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company\nAlpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, “AOS”, “we” or “us”) design, develop and supply a broad range of power\nsemiconductors. The Company's portfolio of products targets high-volume applications, including personal and portable computers, graphic cards, flat panel TVs,\nhome appliances, smart phones, battery packs, quick chargers, home appliances, consumer and industrial motor controls and power supplies for TVs, computers,\nservers and telecommunications equipment. The Company conducts its operations primarily in the United States of America (“USA”), Hong Kong, China, and\nSouth Korea.\nBasis of Preparation\nThe accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission\nRegulation S-X, as amended. They do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. All\nsignificant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal\nrecurring adjustments and accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented have been included in the\ninterim periods. Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal\nyear ending June 30, 2025 or any other interim period. The consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2024 is derived from the audited financial statements included\nin the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nJoint Venture\nOn March 29, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture contract (the “JV Agreement”) with two investment funds owned by the Municipality of\nChongqing (the “Chongqing Funds”), pursuant to which the Company and the Chongqing Funds formed a joint venture, (the “JV Company”), for the purpose of\nconstructing and operating a power semiconductor packaging, testing and 12-inch wafer fabrication facility in the Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing, China (the\n“JV Transaction”). Prior to December 1, 2021, the JV Company was accounted for under the provisions of the consolidation guidance since the Company had\ncontrolling financial interest. As of December 2, 2021, the Company ceased having control over the JV Company. Therefore, the Company deconsolidated the JV\nCompany as of that date. Subsequently, the Company has accounted for its investment in the JV Company using the equity method of accounting. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the percentage of outstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was 42.8%.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates, judgments and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and\nactual results, the consolidated financial statements will be affected. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates, judgments and assumptions\nincluding those related to stock rotation returns, price adjustments, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty accrual, income taxes, leases,\nshare-based compensation, recoverability of and useful lives for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current\noperating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and\nequipment, finance lease liabilities and long-term finance leases liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n6\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nOperating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease\nterm at commencement date. The Company determined its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The\noperating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease\nwhen it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the operating lease ROU asset and lease liability calculation. The Company\ndoes not record leases on the consolidated balance sheet with a term of one year or less. The Company elected to combine its lease and non-lease components as a\nsingle lease component for all asset classes.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the\nperformance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the\ncontract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recognizes product revenue at a point in time when\nproduct is shipped to the customer, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms, net of estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments that it expects\nto provide to certain distributors. The Company presents revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments. Our standard payment terms range from 30 to 60\ndays.\nThe Company sells its products primarily to distributors, who in turn sell the products globally to various end customers. The Company allows stock\nrotation returns from certain distributors. Stock rotation returns are governed by contract and are limited to a specified percentage of the monetary value of\nproducts purchased by distributors during a specified period. The Company records an allowance for stock rotation returns based on historical returns, current\nexpectations, and individual distributor agreements. The Company also provides special pricing to certain distributors, primarily based on volume, to encourage\nresale of the Company’s products. Allowance for price adjustments is recorded against accounts receivable and the provision for stock rotation rights is included\nin accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company’s performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient\nprovided in ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. Therefore, the Company is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price\nallocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period.\nThe Company recognizes the incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which consist of sales commissions, when control over the products they\nrelate to transfers to the customer. Applying the practical expedient, the Company recognizes commissions as expense when incurred, as the amortization period\nof the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year.\nPackaging and testing services revenue is recognized at a point in time upon shipment of serviced products to the customer.\nLicense and Development Revenue Recognition\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a license agreement with a customer, pursuant to which the Company agreed to license its proprietary Silicon\nCarbide (SiC) technology to the customer and engineering and development services for 24 months for a total fee of $45.0 million, consisting of an upfront fee\nand milestone payments of $18.0 million, $6.8 million and $9.0 million paid to the Company in March 2023, July 2023 and February 2024, respectively, with the\nremaining amount to be paid upon the achievement of specified engineering services and product milestones. The license and development fee is determined to be\none performance obligation and is recognized over the 24 months during which the Company performs the engineering and development services. The Company\nuses the input method to measure progress, which method represents a faithful depiction of the transfer of services. During the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, the Company recorded license and development revenue of $5.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. The amount of contract liability is\nrecorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had recorded a total of $36.8 million of license and\ndevelopment revenue. When our performance under the contract precedes our receipt of consideration from the customer, and the receipt of consideration is\nconditional upon factors other than the passage of time, a contract asset is recorded. In addition, the Company also entered an accompanying supply agreement to\nprovide limited wafer supply to the customer.\nShare-based Compensation Expense\n7\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company maintains an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan to grant restricted share units and stock options. The Company recognizes\nexpense related to share-based compensation awards that are ultimately expected to vest based on estimated fair values on the date of grant. The fair value of\nrestricted share units is based on the fair value of the Company’s common share on the date of grant. For restricted stock awards subject to market conditions, the\nfair value of each restricted stock award is estimated at the date of grant using the Monte-Carlo pricing model. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the\ndate of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on the accelerated attribution basis over the\nrequisite service period of the award, which generally equals the vesting period. The Employee Share Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) is accounted for at fair value on\nthe date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company maintains restricted cash in connection with cash balances temporarily restricted for regular business operations. These balances have been\nexcluded from the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance and are classified as restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the amount of restricted cash was $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nEquity method investment\nThe Company uses the equity method of accounting when it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, as determined in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Effective December 1, 2021, the Company reduced its\nequity interest in the JV Company and no longer controlled the JV Company. As a result, beginning December 2, 2021, the Company recorded its investment\nunder the equity method of accounting. Since the Company is unable to obtain accurate financial information from the JV Company in a timely manner, the\nCompany records its share of earnings or losses of such affiliate on a one quarter lag. The Company discloses and recognizes intervening events at the JV\nCompany in the lag period that could materially affect its consolidated financial statements, if applicable.\nThe Company records its interest in the net earnings of the equity method investee, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity\ntransactions and amortization of basis differences, within earnings or loss from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income (loss). Profits or losses\nrelated to intra-entity sales with the equity method investee are eliminated until realized by the investor and investee. Basis differences represent differences\nbetween the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that\ngave rise to them. Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment; instead the equity method investment is tested for impairment. The\nCompany reviews for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in\nvalue is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (loss).\nValuation of inventories\nThe Company carries inventories at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost primarily consists of\nsemiconductor wafers and raw materials, labor, depreciation expenses and other manufacturing expenses and overhead, and packaging and testing fees paid to\nthird parties if subcontractors are used. Valuation of inventories is based on its periodic review of inventory quantities on hand as compared with its sales\nforecasts, historical usage, aging of inventories, production yield levels and current product selling prices. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those\nforecasted by the Company, additional future inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect its operating results. Adjustments to inventory,\nonce established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. If actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and the\nproducts that have previously been written down are sold, our gross margin would be favorably impacted.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of cash equivalents is categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term bank deposits. The\ncarrying values of financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to\ntheir short-term maturities. The carrying value of the\n8\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nCompany's debt is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value which is estimated by considering the current rates available to the Company for debt of the\nsame remaining maturities, structure, credit risk and terms of the debts.\nGovernment Grants\nThe Company occasionally receives government grants that provide financial assistance for certain eligible expenditures in China. These grants include\nreimbursements on interest expense on bank borrowings, payroll tax credits, credit for property, plant and equipment in a particular geographical location,\nemployment credits, as well as business expansion credits. Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will\ncomply with the conditions attaching to it, and that the grant will be received. The Company records such grants either as a reduction of the related expense, a\nreduction of the cost of the related asset, or as other income depending upon the nature of the grant. As a result of such grants, during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company reduced property, plant and equipment by $0.2 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did\nnot receive any grants.\nAccounting for income taxes\nIncome tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before income taxes. The Company’s interim period tax provision for (benefit from) income taxes\nis determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates\nits estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment in such period.\nThe Company’s quarterly tax provision and estimate of its annual effective tax rate are subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in\naccurately predicting its pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in how the Company does business.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and their reported amounts.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income\ntaxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Company\nestablishes accruals for certain tax contingencies based on estimates of whether additional taxes may be due. While the final tax outcome of these matters may\ndiffer from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such\ndetermination is made.\nThe Company is subject to income tax expense or benefit based upon pre-tax income or loss reported in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the\nprovisions of currently enacted tax laws. The parent company is incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and is subject to Bermuda law with respect to taxation.\nUnder current Bermuda law, the Company is not subject to any income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. As we have previously disclosed, the Government of\nBermuda announced in December 2023 that it enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023, potentially imposing a 15% corporate income tax (CIT) on Bermuda\ncompanies that are within the scope of the CIT, that will be effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. In particular, the CIT applies to\nmultinational companies with annual revenue of 750 million euros or more in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent entity for at least two of\nthe four fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year when the CIT may apply.\nThe Company is not in a position to determine whether the annual revenues may meet and/or cross the 750 million Euro threshold for at least two of the\nfour fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year when CIT may apply. The Company continues to monitor and assess if and when it may be within the\nscope of the CIT. If we become subject to the Bermuda CIT, we may be subject to additional income taxes, which may adversely affect our financial position,\nresults of operations and our overall business.\nSignificant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than\nnot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or research and development tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a\nvaluation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. The Company considers all available positive and\nnegative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. The Company\nconsiders evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.\n9\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), issued guidance which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability\nthreshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely\nthan not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the\ntechnical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized\nupon ultimate settlement. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model,\nthe determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. If the ultimate\nresolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated, a material impact on income tax expense could result.\nThe Company's provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by changes in earnings or tax laws and regulations in\nvarious jurisdictions. The Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income\ntaxes. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes\nin the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to reserves, as well as the related net interest\nand penalties.\nLong-lived Assets\nThe Company reviews all long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that these assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating\nlong-lived assets, if the Company concludes that the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying value, the Company\nrecognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values, which could adversely affect its results of\noperations.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and\ncircumstances from non-owner sources. The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of cumulative foreign currency translation\nadjustments. Total comprehensive income (loss) is presented in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive Income (loss).\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nNone\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards not yet adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which\nimproves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU also expands\ndisclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to better understand the entity’s measurement and assessment of segment performance and\nresource allocation. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its disclosures within the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which enhances the\ntransparency, effectiveness and comparability of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information related to\nincome tax rate reconciliations and the jurisdictions in which income taxes are paid. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its income tax disclosures within the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n10\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n11\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n2. Equity Method Investment in Equity Investee\nOn December 1, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), Alpha & Omega Semiconductor (Shanghai) Ltd. (“AOS SH”) and Agape Package Manufacturing (Shanghai)\nLimited (“APM SH” and, together with AOS SH, the “Sellers”), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a share transfer agreement\n(“STA”) with a third-party investor to sell a portion of the Company's equity interest in the JV Company which consists of a power semiconductor packaging,\ntesting and 12-inch wafer fabrication facility in Chongqing, China (the “Transaction”). The Transaction closed on December 2, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which\nreduced the Company’s equity interest in the JV Company from 50.9% to 48.8%. Also, the Company’s right to designate directors on the board of JV Company\nwas reduced to three (3) out of seven (7) directors, from four (4) directors prior to the Transaction. As a result of the Transaction and other factors, the Company\nno longer has a controlling financial interest in the JV Company. The JV Company was deconsolidated from the consolidated financial statements effective as of\nthe Closing Date.\nOn December 24, 2021, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement with another third-party investor, pursuant to which the Company sold to this\ninvestor 1.1% of outstanding equity interest held by the Company in the JV Company. In addition, the JV Company adopted an employee equity incentive plan\nand issued an equity interest equivalent to 3.99% of the JV Company in exchange to cash. As a result of these two transactions, the Company owned 45.8% of the\nequity interest in the JV Company as of December 31, 2021.\nOn January 26, 2022, the JV Company completed a financing transaction pursuant to a corporate investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”)\nbetween the JV Company and certain third-party investors (the “New Investors”). Under the Investment Agreement, the New Investors purchased newly issued\nequity interest of the JV Company, representing approximately 7.82% of post-transaction outstanding equity interests of the JV Company, for a total purchase\nprice of RMB 509 million (or approximately USD 80 million based on the currency exchange rate as of January 26, 2022) (the “Investment”). Following the\nclosing of the Investment and as of June 30, 2022, the percentage of outstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was reduced to 42.2%.\nIn February 2024, the JV Company repurchased certain shares that were previously issued to employees under the employee equity incentive plan, which\nincreased the Company’s percentage of equity ownership in the JV Company by 0.54%. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the percentage of\noutstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was 42.8%.\nThe Company accounts for its investment in the JV Company as an equity method investment and reports its equity in earnings or loss of the JV Company\non a three-month lag due to an inability to timely obtain financial information of the JV Company. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nthe Company recorded a $1.0 million loss and $2.7 million loss of its equity share of the JV Company, respectively, using lag reporting.\n12\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n3. Related Party Transactions\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company owned a 42.8% equity interest in the JV Company, which, by definition, is a related party to the Company. The JV\nCompany supplies 12-inch wafers and provides assembly and testing services to AOS. AOS previously sold 8-inch wafers to the JV Company for further\nassembly and testing services until January 1, 2023, when it changed to consign the 8-inch wafers to the JV Company. Due to the right of offset of receivables and\npayables with the JV Company, as of September 30, 2024, AOS recorded the net amount of $17.2 million as payable related to equity investee, net, in the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The purchases by AOS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $28.3 million and $29.8 million,\nrespectively, and the sales by AOS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $2.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\n13\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n4.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers\nThe Company manages its credit risk associated with exposure to distributors and direct customers on outstanding accounts receivable through the\napplication and review of credit approvals, credit ratings and other monitoring procedures. In some instances, the Company also obtains letters of credit from\ncertain customers.\nCredit sales, which are mainly on credit terms of 30 to 60 days, are only made to customers who meet the Company’s credit requirements, while sales to\nnew customers or customers with low credit ratings are usually made on an advance payment basis. The Company considers its trade accounts receivable to be of\ngood credit quality because its key distributors and direct customers have long-standing business relationships with the Company and the Company has not\nexperienced any significant bad debt write-offs of accounts receivable in the past. The Company closely monitors the aging of accounts receivable from its\ndistributors and direct customers, and regularly reviews their financial positions, where available.\nSummarized below are individual customers whose revenue or accounts receivable balances were 10% or higher than the respective total consolidated\namounts:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nPercentage of revenue 2024 2023\nCustomer A 22.5 % 23.9 %\nCustomer B 51.5 % 46.6 %\nSeptember 30, June 30,\nPercentage of accounts receivable 2024 2024\nCustomer B 51.0 % *\nCustomer C 14.3 % 33.4 %\nCustomer D 11.1 % 33.4 %\n* Less than 10%\n15\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n6.

Bank Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings\nIn March 2024, Bank of Communications Limited in China provided a line of credit facility to one of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries in China. The purpose of the credit facility is to provide working capital borrowings. The Company could borrow up to approximately RMB\n140 million or $20.0 million based on currency exchange rate between RMB and U.S. Dollar on September 30, 2024 with a maturity date of March 15, 2025. As\nof September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance for this loan.\nIn December 2023, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China provided a line of credit facility to one of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries in China. The purpose of the credit facility was to provide working capital borrowings. The Company could borrow up to approximately RMB\n72.0 million, or $10.3 million based on currency exchange rate between RMB and U.S. Dollar on September 30, 2024, with a maturity date of December 31,\n2024. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance for this loan.\nIn September 2023, China Construction Bank provided a line of credit facility to one of the Company’s subsidiaries in\nChina. The purpose of the credit facility is to provide working capital borrowings. The Company could borrow up to approximately RMB 50 million or\n$7.1 million based on currency exchange rate between RMB and U.S. Dollar on September 30, 2024 with a maturity date of September 8, 2025. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance for this loan.\nAccounts Receivable Factoring Agreement\nOn August 9, 2019, one of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Borrower”) entered into a factoring agreement with Hongkong and Shanghai\nBanking Corporation Limited (“HSBC”), whereby the Borrower assigns certain of its accounts receivable with recourse. This factoring agreement allows the\nBorrower to borrow up to 70% of the net amount of its eligible accounts receivable of the Borrower with a maximum amount of $30.0 million. The interest rate is\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), plus 2.01% per annum. The Company is the guarantor for this agreement. The Company is accounting\nfor this transaction as a secured borrowing. In addition, any cash held in the restricted bank account controlled by HSBC has a legal right of offset against the\nborrowing. This agreement, with certain financial covenants required, has no expiration date. On August 11, 2021, the Borrower signed an agreement with HSBC\nto reduce the borrowing maximum amount to $8.0 million with certain financial covenants required. Other terms remain the same. As of September 30, 2024, the\nBorrower was in compliance with these covenants. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance and the Company had unused credit of\napproximately $8.0 million.\nDebt financing\nIn September 2021, Jireh Semiconductor Incorporated (“Jireh”), one of the wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a financing arrangement agreement with\na company (“Lender”) for the lease and purchase of a machinery equipment manufactured by a supplier. This agreement has a 5 years term, after which Jireh has\nthe option to purchase the equipment for $1. The implied interest rate was 4.75% per annum which was adjustable based on every five basis point increase in 60-\nmonth U.S. Treasury Notes, until the final installation and acceptance of the equipment. The total purchase price of this equipment was euro 12.0 million. In April\n2021, Jireh made a down payment of euro 6.0 million, representing 50% of the total purchase price of the equipment, to the supplier. In June 2022, the equipment\nwas delivered to Jireh after Lender paid 40% of the total purchase price, for euro 4.8 million, to the supplier on behalf of Jireh. In September 2022, Lender paid\nthe remaining 10% payment for the total purchase price and reimbursed Jireh for the 50% down payment, after the installation and configuration of the\nequipment. The title of the equipment was transferred to Lender following such payment. The agreement was amended with fixed implied interest rate of 7.51%\nand monthly payment of principal and interest effective in October 2022. Other terms remain the same. In addition, Jireh purchased hardware for the machine\nunder this financing arrangement. The purchase price of this hardware was $0.2 million. The financing arrangement is secured by this equipment and other\nequipment which had the net book value of $13.2 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of this debt financing was\n$8.5 million.\nLong-term bank borrowings\nOn August 18, 2021, Jireh entered into a term loan agreement with a financial institution (the “Bank”) in an amount up to $45.0 million for the purpose of\nexpanding and upgrading the Company’s fabrication facility located in Oregon. The obligation\n20\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nunder the loan agreement is secured by substantially all assets of Jireh and guaranteed by the Company. The agreement has a 5.5 year term and matures on\nFebruary 16, 2027. Jireh is required to make consecutive quarterly payments of principal and interest. The loan accrues interest based on adjusted SOFR plus the\napplicable margin based on the outstanding balance of the loan. This agreement contains customary restrictive covenants and includes certain financial covenants\nthat the Company is required to maintain. Jireh drew down $45.0 million on February 16, 2022 with the first payment of principal beginning in October 2022. As\nof September 30, 2024, Jireh was in compliance with these covenants and the outstanding balance of this loan was $27.0 million.\nMaturities of short-term debt and long-term debt were as follows (in thousands):\nYear ending June 30,\n2025 (Remaining) $ 8,767\n2026 11,871\n2027 14,344\n2028 536\nTotal principal 35,518\nLess: debt issuance costs (48)\nTotal principal, less debt issuance costs $ 35,470\nShort-term Debt Long-term Debt Total\nPrincipal amount $ 11,714 $ 23,804 $ 35,518\nLess: debt issuance costs (26) (22) (48)\nTotal debt, less debt issuance costs $ 11,688 $ 23,782 $ 35,470\n8. Leases\nThe Company evaluates contracts for lease accounting at contract inception and assesses lease classification at the lease commencement date. Operating\nleases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities - long-term on the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, finance lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities-long-term on the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognizes a ROU asset and corresponding lease obligation liability at the lease commencement date\nwhere the lease obligation liability is measured at the present value of the minimum lease payments. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the\nCompany uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement. The Company uses an interest rate commensurate with the interest rate to borrow on a\ncollateralized basis over a similar term with an amount equal to the lease payments. Operating leases are primarily related to offices, research and development\nfacilities, sales and marketing facilities, and manufacturing facilities. In addition, long-term supply agreements to lease gas tank equipment and purchase\nindustrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include renewal provisions and require the Company to pay real estate taxes,\ninsurance and maintenance costs. For operating leases, the amortization of the ROU asset and the accretion of its lease obligation liability result in a single\nstraight-line expense recognized over the lease term. The finance lease is related to the $5.1 million of a machinery lease financing with a vendor. In September\n2022, the lease was amended to make a monthly payment of principal and interest as a fixed amount effective in October 2022. Other terms remain the same. The\namendment was accounted for as a debt modification and no gain or loss was recognized. The Company does not record leases on the Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets with a term of one year or less.\nThe components of the Company’s operating and finance lease expenses are as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\n21\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nOperating leases:\nFixed rent expense $ 1,737 $ 2,437\nVariable rent expense 270 252\nFinance lease:\nAmortization of equipment 128 128\nInterest 59 75\nShort-term leases\nShort-term lease expenses 32 40\nTotal lease expenses $ 2,226 $ 2,932\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s operating and finance leases is as follows (in thousands, except lease term and discount\nrate):\nJune 30,\nSeptember 30, 2024 2024\nOperating Leases:\nROU assets associated with operating leases $ 24,758 $ 25,050\nFinance Lease:\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross $ 5,133 $ 5,133\nAccumulated depreciation (1,299) (1,171)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 3,834 $ 3,962\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years)\nOperating leases 5.36 5.54\nFinance lease 3.00 3.25\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases 4.91 % 4.91 %\nFinance lease 7.51 % 7.51 %\nSupplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating and finance leases is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash paid from amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 1,607 $ 1,590\nOperating cash flows from finance lease $ 59 $ 75\nFinancing cash flows from finance lease $ 227 $ 211\nNon-cash investing and financing information:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 832 $ 3,588\nFuture minimum lease payments are as follows as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\n22\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nYear ending June 30, Operating Leases Finance Leases\nThe remainder of fiscal 2025 $ 4,882 $ 858\n2026 5,793 1,144\n2027 4,863 1,144\n2028 4,314 191\n2029 4,027 —\nThereafter 5,274 —\nTotal minimum lease payments 29,153 3,337\nLess amount representing interest (3,630) (348)\nTotal lease liabilities $ 25,523 $ 2,989\n23\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n9.

The number of shares to be earned\nat the end of performance period was determined based on the Company’s achievement of specified stock prices and revenue thresholds during the performance\nperiod from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024 as well as the recipients remaining in continuous service with the Company through such period. The MSUs\nvest in four equal annual installments after the end of performance period. The Company estimated the grant date fair values of its MSUs using a Monte-Carlo\nsimulation model. In September 2023, the Company determined it was no longer probable that it would achieve the minimum revenue threshold specified in the\nawards. Therefore, the Company reversed all of the previously recognized expenses of $6.4 million for these MSUs. In addition, on September 19, 2023, the\nCompensation Committee of the Board approved a modification of the terms of MSUs to extend the performance period through December 31, 2025, changed the\ncommencement date for the four-year time-based service period to January 1, 2026, and reduced the achievement of specified stock prices and revenue\nthresholds. The fair value of these MSUs was revalued to reflect the change using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. In June 2024, the Company determined it was\nno longer probable that the revenue thresholds for the modified MSU would be achieved. Therefore, the Company reversed $2.4 million in the June 2024 quarter\nthat was recorded during the fiscal year 2024 related to the modification on September 19, 2023. On August 8, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Board\napproved a modification of the terms of MSUs to extend the performance period through December 31, 2026, change the commencement date for the four-year\ntime-based service period to January 1, 2027, and reduce the revenue thresholds. The fair value of these MSUs was revalued to reflect the change using a Monte-\nCarlo simulation model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 3.93%, expected term of 2.40 years, expected volatility of 57.81% and dividend\nyield of 0%. The Company recorded $0.8 million of expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and a negative $6.3 million of expenses for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2018, the Company granted 1.3 million MSUs to certain personnel. The number of shares to be earned at the end of\nperformance period is determined based on the Company’s achievement of specified stock prices and revenue thresholds during the performance period from\nJanuary 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 as well as the recipients remaining in continuous service with the Company through such period. The MSUs vest in four\nequal annual installments after the end of the performance period. The Company estimated the grant date fair values of its MSUs using a Monte-Carlo simulation\nmodel. On August 31, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved a modification of the terms of MSU to (i) extend the performance period\nthrough December 31, 2022 and (ii) change the commencement date for the four-year time-based service period to January 1, 2023. The fair value of these MSUs\nwas recalculated to reflect the change as of August 31, 2020 and the unrecognized compensation amount was adjusted to reflect the increase in fair value. The\nCompany recorded $0.2 million and $0.3 million of expenses for MSUs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’ MSUs activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024:\n24\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNumber of Market-based Weighted Average\nPerformance-based Weighted Average Remaining\nRestricted Stock Grant Date Fair Contractual Term\nUnits Value Per Share (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value\nNonvested at June 30, 2024 1,727,000 $ 28.15 2.83 $ 64,537,990\nForfeited (8,000) $ —\nNonvested at September 30, 2024 1,719,000 $ 28.05 3.10 $ 63,809,280\nPerformance-based Restricted Stock Units (“PRSUs”)\nIn March of each year since year 2017, the Company granted PRSUs to certain personnel.

Income Taxes\nThe Company recognized income tax expense of approximately $1.0 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The income tax expense of $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included a $0.08 million discrete tax expense. The income\ntax expense of $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a $0.05 million discrete tax expense. Excluding the discrete income tax\nitems, the income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (65.8)% and 15.7%, respectively. The changes in the tax expense and effective tax rate between the\nperiods resulted primarily from changes in the mix of earnings in various geographic jurisdictions between the current year and the same period of last year as\nwell as from reporting pretax book loss of $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $6.9 million of pretax book income for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Company files its income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The tax years 2004 to 2024 remain open to examination\nby U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The tax years 2018 to 2024 remain open to examination by foreign tax authorities.\nThe Company’s income tax returns are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. In\naccordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting\nfrom these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $10.1 million, of which $6.9 million, if recognized, would reduce the\neffective income tax rate in future periods. If the Company’s estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, then a further charge\nto expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in\ntax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. The Company does not anticipate any material\nchanges to its uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months.\n“The Chip and Science Act of 2022”, Enacted August 2, 2022\nIn August 2022 the U.S. enacted the Chip and Science Act of 2022 (the Chips Act). The Chips Act provides incentives to semiconductor chip manufacturers\nin the United States, including providing a 25% manufacturing investment credits for investments in semiconductor manufacturing property placed in service\nafter December 31, 2022, for which construction begins before January 1, 2027. Property investments qualify for the 25% credit if, among other requirements, the\nproperty is integral to the operation of an advanced manufacturing facility, defined as having a primary purpose of manufacturing semiconductors or\nsemiconductor manufacturing equipment. Currently, we are evaluating the impact of the Chips Act to us.\n“The Inflation Reduction Act”, Enacted August 16, 2022\nIn August 2022 the United States enacted tax legislation through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA introduces a 15% corporate alternative\nminimum tax (CAMT) for corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) for\n26\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nany consecutive three-tax-year period preceding the applicable tax year exceeds $1 billion. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after 31 December\n2022. The CAMT is currently not applicable to the Company.\nBermuda Corporate Income Tax for Tax Years Beginning in 2025\nThe Company is subject to income tax expense or benefit based upon pre-tax income or loss reported in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the\nprovisions of currently enacted tax laws. The parent company is incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and is subject to Bermuda law with respect to taxation.\nUnder current Bermuda law, the Company is not subject to any income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. As we have previously disclosed, the Government of\nBermuda announced in December 2023 that it enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023, potentially imposing a 15% corporate income tax (CIT) on Bermuda\ncompanies that are within the scope of the CIT, that will be effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. In particular, the CIT applies to\nmultinational companies with annual revenue of 750 million euros or more in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent entity for at least two of\nthe four fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year when the CIT may apply.\nThe Company is not in a position to determine whether the annual revenues may meet and/or cross the 750 million Euro threshold for at least two of the\nfour fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year when CIT may apply. The Company continues to monitor and assess if and when it may be within the\nscope of the CIT. If we become subject to the Bermuda CIT, we may be subject to additional income taxes, which may adversely affect our financial position,\nresults of operations and our overall business.\nAltera Litigation\nOn July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an\nintercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In the July 2015 ruling, the Tax Court concluded that the sharing of the cost of employee stock compensation in a\ncompany’s cost-sharing arrangement was invalid under the U.S. Administrative Procedures Act. In June 2019, a panel of the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of\nAppeals reversed this decision. In July 2019, Altera petitioned U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to hold an en banc rehearing of the case. The petition\nwas subsequently denied by the Ninth Circuit. Altera appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2020, but the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear\nthe case in June 2020, leaving intact the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s decision. AOS has not recorded any benefit related to the Altera\nCorporation Tax Court decision in any period through September 30, 2024. The Company will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impact to\nits financial statements.\n27\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n11. Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company is organized as, and operates in, one operating segment: the design, development and supply of power semiconductor products for computing,\nconsumer electronics, communication and industrial applications. The chief operating decision-makers are the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive\nOfficer. The financial information presented to the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is on a consolidated basis, accompanied by\ninformation about revenue by customer and geographic region, for purposes of evaluating financial performance and allocating resources. The Company has one\nbusiness segment, and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results and plans for products or components below the\nconsolidated unit level. Accordingly, the Company reports as a single operating segment.\nThe Company sells its products primarily to distributors in the Asia Pacific region, who in turn sell these products to end customers. Because the Company’s\ndistributors sell their products to end customers which may have a global presence, revenue by geographical location is not necessarily representative of the\ngeographical distribution of sales to end user markets.\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a license agreement with a customer to license the Company’s proprietary SiC technology and to provide 24-\nmonth engineering and development services for a total fee of $45 million.\nThe revenue by geographical location in the following tables is based on the country or region in which the products were shipped to:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nHong Kong $ 153,495 $ 141,206\nChina 21,255 26,619\nSouth Korea 290 5,311\nUnited States 1,073 1,395\nOther countries 5,774 6,102\n$ 181,887 $ 180,633\nThe following is a summary of revenue by product type:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nPower discrete $ 122,454 $ 121,500\nPower IC 52,940 52,747\nPackaging and testing services and other 852 745\nLicense and development services 5,641 5,641\n$ 181,887 $ 180,633\n28\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nLong-lived assets, net consisting of property, plant and equipment and land use rights, as well as operating lease right-of-use assets, net by geographical area\nare as follows:\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2024 2024\n(in thousands)\nChina $ 103,254 $ 106,666\nUnited States 243,021 249,791\nOther countries 6,095 5,212\n$ 352,370 $ 361,669\n29\nALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $107.4 million and $100.8 million, respectively, of outstanding purchase\ncommitments primarily for purchases of semiconductor raw materials, wafers, spare parts, packaging and testing services and others.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $6.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively, of capital commitments for the\npurchase of property and equipment.\nOther Commitments\nSee Note 7 and Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for descriptions of\ncommitments including bank borrowings and leases.\nContingencies and Indemnities\nThe Company has in the past, and may from time to time in the future, become involved in legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business\nactivities. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, including claims regarding patent and other intellectual property rights\nas well as improper hiring practices. Irrespective of the validity of such claims, the Company could incur significant costs in the defense of such claims and suffer\nadverse effects on its operations.\nIn December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) commenced an investigation into the Company’s compliance with export control regulations\nrelating to its business transactions with Huawei and its affiliates (“Huawei”), which were added to the “Entity List” maintained by the Department of Commerce\n(“DOC”) on May 16, 2019. The Company cooperated fully with federal authorities in the investigation, including responding to requests for documents,\ninformation and interviews from the DOJ in connection with the investigation. In connection with this investigation, the DOC requested the Company to suspend\nshipments of its products to Huawei, and the Company complied with such request. The Company has not shipped any product to Huawei after December 31,\n2019. On January 19, 2024, the DOJ informed the Company that it has closed such investigation without any charges. The Company continues to cooperate with\nthe DOC in the ongoing civil investigation. The DOC has not informed the Company of any specific timeline or schedule under which the DOC will complete its\nreview.\nThe Company is a party to a variety of agreements contracted with various third parties. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company may be obligated to\nindemnify another party to such an agreement with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by the\nCompany, under which the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants\nrelated to such matters as title to assets sold, certain intellectual property rights, specified environmental matters and certain income taxes. In these circumstances,\npayment by the Company is customarily conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which\nprocedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party’s claim. Further, the Company's obligations under these agreements may be limited in time\nand/or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by it under these agreements. The\nCompany has not historically paid or recorded any material indemnifications, and no accrual was made at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\nThe Company has agreed to indemnify its directors and certain employees as permitted by law and pursuant to its Bye-laws, and has entered into\nindemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. The Company has not recorded a liability associated with these indemnification\narrangements, as it historically has not incurred any material costs associated with such indemnification obligations. Costs associated with such indemnification\nobligations may be mitigated by insurance coverage that the Company maintains. However, such insurance may not cover any, or may cover only a portion of, the\namounts the Company may be required to pay. In addition, the Company may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage at a reasonable cost.\n30\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters addressed in this Item 2 constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward looking statements\ninclude, but are not limited to, statements regarding future financial performance of the Company; the expected ramp up timeline of the 12-inch fab at the JV\nCompany; and other statements and information set forth under the heading “Factors Affecting Our Performance”. Such forward-looking statements are subject\nto a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below under the heading “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nthat could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the Company’s management. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\n(the “Act”) provides certain “safe harbor” provisions for forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\nQ are made pursuant to the Act. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to its forward-looking statements that may\nbe made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unexpected events. Unless the context otherwise requires, the words\n“AOS,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited and its subsidiaries.\nManagement’s discussion should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 23, 2024.\nOverview\nWe are a designer, developer and global supplier of a broad portfolio of power semiconductors. Our portfolio of power semiconductors includes\napproximately 2,700 products, and has grown significantly with the introduction of over 100 new products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and over 60 and\n130 new products in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we introduced an 29 new\nproducts. Our teams of scientists and engineers have developed extensive intellectual property and technical knowledge that encompass major aspects of power\nsemiconductors, which we believe enables us to introduce and develop innovative products to address the increasingly complex power requirements of advanced\nelectronics. We have an extensive patent portfolio that consists of 935 patents and 53 patent applications in the United States as of September 30, 2024. We also\nhave a total of 1,039 foreign patents, which were based primarily on our research and development efforts through September 30, 2024. We differentiate\nourselves by integrating our expertise in technology, design and advanced manufacturing and packaging to optimize product performance and cost. Our portfolio\nof products targets high-volume applications, including personal computers, graphic cards, game consoles, flat panel TVs, home appliances, power tools, smart\nphones, battery packs, consumer and industrial motor controls and power supplies for TVs, computers, servers and telecommunications equipment.\nOur business model leverages global resources, including research and development and manufacturing in the United States and Asia. Our sales and\ntechnical support teams are localized in several growing markets. We operate an 8-inch wafer fabrication facility located in Hillsboro, Oregon, or the Oregon Fab,\nwhich is critical for us to accelerate proprietary technology development, new product introduction and improve our financial performance. To meet the market\ndemand for the more mature high volume products, we also utilize the wafer manufacturing capacity of selected third party foundries. For assembly and test, we\nprimarily rely upon our in-house facilities in China. In addition, we utilize subcontracting partners for industry standard packages. We believe our in-house\npackaging and testing capability provides us with a competitive advantage in proprietary packaging technology, product quality, cost and sales cycle time.\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, we continued our product diversification program by developing new silicon and packaging platforms\nto expand our serviceable available market, or SAM and offer higher performance products. Our metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, or MOSFET,\nand power IC product portfolio also expanded.\nOn March 29, 2016, we formed a joint venture (the “JV Company”) with two investment funds owned by the Municipality of Chongqing (the “Chongqing\nFunds”), for the purpose of constructing and operating a power semiconductor packaging, testing and 12-inch wafer fabrication facility (“Fab”) in the LiangJiang\nNew Area of Chongqing, China. As of December 1, 2021, we owned 50.9%, and the Chongqing Funds owned 49.1% of the equity interest in the JV Company.\nThe Joint Venture was accounted under the provisions of the consolidation guidance since we had controlling financial interests until December 1, 2021.\nOn December 1, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), Alpha & Omega Semiconductor (Shanghai) Ltd. (“AOS SH”) and Agape Package Manufacturing (Shanghai)\nLimited (“APM SH” and, together with AOS SH, the “Sellers”), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a share transfer agreement\n(“STA”) with a third-party investor to sell a portion of the Company's equity interest in the JV Company which consists of a power semiconductor packaging,\ntesting and 12-inch wafer\n31\nfabrication facility in Chongqing, China (the “Transaction”). The Transaction closed on December 2, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which reduced the Company’s\nequity interest in the JV Company from 50.9% to 48.8%. Also, the Company’s right to designate directors on the board of JV Company was reduced to three (3)\nout of seven (7) directors, from four (4) directors prior to the Transaction. As a result of the Transaction and other factors, the Company no longer had a\ncontrolling financial interest in the JV Company. The JV Company was deconsolidated from the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements effective as of the\nClosing Date.\nOn December 24, 2021, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement with another third-party investor, pursuant to which the Company sold to this\ninvestor 1.1% of outstanding equity interest held by the Company in the JV Company. In addition, the JV Company adopted an employee equity incentive plan\nand issued an equity interest equivalent to 3.99% of the JV Company in exchange for cash. As a result of these two transactions, the Company owned 45.8% of\nthe equity interest in the JV Company as of December 31, 2021.\nOn January 26, 2022, the JV Company completed a financing transaction pursuant to a corporate investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”)\nbetween the JV Company and certain third-party investors (the “New Investors”). Under the Investment Agreement, the New Investors purchased newly issued\nequity interest of the JV Company, representing approximately 7.82% of post-transaction outstanding equity interests of the JV Company, for a total purchase\nprice of RMB 509 million (or approximately USD 80 million based on the currency exchange rate as of January 26, 2022) (the “Investment”). Following the\nclosing of the January 26, 2022 Investment, the percentage of outstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was reduced to 42.2% at June\n30, 2022.\nIn February 2024, the JV Company repurchased certain shares that were previously issued to employees under the employee equity incentive plan, which\nincreased the Company’s percentage of equity ownership in the JV Company by 0.54%. As of September 30, 2024, the percentage of outstanding JV equity\ninterest beneficially owned by the Company was 42.8%.\nWe reduced our ownership of the JV Company to below 50% to increase the flexibility of the JV Company to raise capital to fund its future expansion. The\nJV Company is also contemplating an eventual listing on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, or STAR Market, of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The\nreduction of our ownership assists the JV Company in meeting certain regulatory listing requirements. A potential STAR Market listing may take several years to\nconsummate and there is no guarantee that such listing by the JV Company will be successful or will be completed in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, the\nJV Company will continue to provide us with significant level of foundry capacity to enable us to develop and manufacture our products. On July 12, 2022, the\ncurrent shareholders of the JV Company entered into a shareholders contract, pursuant to which the JV Company committed to provide us with a monthly wafer\nproduction capacity until December 2023, and additional commitment to provide wafer capacity after December 2023 if the JV Company’s production capacity\nreaches certain specified level.\nOther Factors affecting our Performance\nThe global, regional economic and PC market conditions: Because our products primarily serve consumer electronic applications, any significant changes\nin global and regional economic conditions could materially affect our revenue and results of operations. A significant amount of our revenue is derived from\nsales of products in the PC markets, such as notebooks, motherboards and notebook battery packs. Therefore, a substantial decline in the PC market could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. The PC markets have experienced a modest global decline in recent years due to continued\ngrowth of demand in tablets and smart phones, worldwide economic conditions and the industry inventory correction which had and may continue to have a\nmaterial impact on the demand for our products.\nA decline of the PC market may have a negative impact on our revenue, factory utilization, gross margin, our ability to resell excess inventory, and other\nperformance measures. We have executed and continue to execute strategies to diversify our product portfolio, penetrate other market segments, including the\nconsumer, communications and industrial markets, and improve gross margins and profit by implementing cost control measures. While making efforts to reduce\nour reliance on the computing market, we continue to support our computing business and capitalize on the opportunities in this market with a more focused and\ncompetitive PC product strategy to gain market share.\nManufacturing costs and capacity availability: Our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including our manufacturing costs, utilization of our\nmanufacturing facilities, the product mixes of our sales, pricing of wafers from third party foundries and pricing of semiconductor raw materials. Capacity\nutilization affects our gross margin because we have certain fixed costs at our Shanghai facilities and our Oregon Fab. If we are unable to utilize our\nmanufacturing facilities at a desired level, our gross margin may be adversely affected. In addition, from time to time, we may experience wafer capacity\nconstraints, particularly at third party foundries, that may prevent us from meeting fully the demand of our customers. While we can mitigate these constraints by\nincreasing and re-allocating capacity at our own fab, we may not be able to do so quickly or at sufficient level, which could adversely affect our financial\nconditions and results of operations. We also rely on the JV\n32\nCompany to provide foundry capacity to manufacture our products, therefore it is important that we maintain continuous access to such capacity, which may not\nbe available at sufficient level or at pricing terms favorable to us because of lack of control over the JV Company’s operation. We continue to maintain a business\nrelationship with the JV Company to ensure uninterrupted supply of manufacturing capacity. Because we continue to rely on the JV Company to provide us with\nmanufacturing capacity, if the JV Company take actions or make decisions that prevents us from accessing required capacity, our operations may be adversely\naffected.\nErosion and fluctuation of average selling price: Erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical in our industry. Consistent with this\nhistorical trend, we expect our average selling prices of our existing products to decline in the future. However, in the normal course of business, we seek to offset\nthe effect of declining average selling price by introducing new and higher value products, expanding existing products for new applications and new customers\nand reducing the manufacturing cost of existing products. These strategies may cause the average selling price of our products to fluctuate significantly from time\nto time, thereby affecting our financial performance and profitability.\nProduct introductions and customers’ product requirements: Our success depends on our ability to introduce products on a timely basis that meet or are\ncompatible with our customers' specifications and performance requirements. Both factors, timeliness of product introductions and conformance to customers'\nrequirements, are equally important in securing design wins with our customers. As we accelerate the development of new technology platforms, we expect to\nincrease the pace at which we introduce new products and seek and acquire design wins. If we were to fail to introduce new products on a timely basis that meet\ncustomers’ specifications and performance requirements, particularly those products with major OEM customers, and continue to expand our serviceable markets,\nthen we would lose market share and our financial performance would be adversely affected.\nDistributor ordering patterns, customer demand and seasonality: Our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their forecasts of end customer\ndemand, and this demand may vary significantly depending on the sales outlook and market and economic conditions of end customers. Because these forecasts\nmay not be accurate, channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly, which in turn may prompt distributors to make significant adjustments\nto their purchase orders placed with us. As a result, our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, because our\nproducts are used in consumer electronics products, our revenue is subject to seasonality. Our sales seasonality is affected by numerous factors, including global\nand regional economic conditions as well as the PC market conditions, revenue generated from new products, changes in distributor ordering patterns in response\nto channel inventory adjustments and end customer demand for our products and fluctuations in consumer purchase patterns prior to major holiday seasons. In\nrecent periods, broad fluctuations in the semiconductor markets and the global and regional economic conditions, in particular the changing PC market\nconditions, have had a more significant impact on our results of operations than seasonality. Furthermore, our revenue may be impacted by the level of demand\nfrom our major customers due to factors outside of our control. If these major customers experience significant decline in the demand of their products, encounter\ndifficulties or defects in their products, or otherwise fail to execute their sales and marketing strategies successfully, it may adversely affect our revenue and\nresults of operations.\n33\nPrincipal line items of condensed consolidated statements of income (loss)\nThe following describes the principal line items set forth in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (loss).\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of power semiconductors, consisting of power discretes and power ICs. Historically, a majority of our revenue\nhas been derived from power discrete products. Because our products typically have three-year to five-year life cycles, the rate of new product introduction is an\nimportant driver of revenue growth over time. We believe that expanding the breadth of our product portfolio is important to our business prospects, because it\nprovides us with an opportunity to increase our total bill-of-materials within an electronic system and to address the power requirements of additional electronic\nsystems. In addition, a small percentage of our total revenue is generated by providing packaging and testing services to third parties through one of our in-house\nfacilities.\nOur product revenue is reported net of the effect of the estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments that we expect to provide to our distributors.\nStock rotation returns are governed by contract and are limited to a specified percentage of the monetary value of products purchased by the distributor during a\nspecified period. At our discretion or upon our direct negotiations with the original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) or original equipment manufacturers\n(“OEMs”), we may elect to grant special pricing that is below the prices at which we sold our products to the distributors. In certain situations, we will grant price\nadjustments to the distributors reflecting such special pricing. We estimate the price adjustments for inventory at the distributors based on factors such as\ndistributor inventory levels, forecasted distributor selling prices, distributor margins and demand for our products.\nIn February 2023, we entered into a license agreement with a customer to license our proprietary SiC technology and to provide 24-months of engineering\nand development services for a total fee of $45.0 million, consisting of an upfront fee and milestone payments of $18.0 million, $6.8 million and $9.0 million\npaid to us in the March 2023, July 2023 and February 2024, respectively, with the remaining amount to be paid upon the achievement of specified engineering\nservices and product milestones. The license and development fee is determined to be one performance obligation and is recognized over the 24 months during\nwhich we perform the engineering and development services. We use the input method to measure progression of the transfer of services. During three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $5.6 million and $5.6 million of license and development revenue, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we\nhad recorded a total of $36.8 million of license and development revenue. When our performance under the contract precedes our receipt of consideration from\nthe customer, and the receipt of consideration is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time, a contract asset is recorded. We also entered an\naccompanying supply agreement to provide limited wafer supply to the customer.\nCost of goods sold\nOur cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs associated with semiconductor wafers, packaging and testing, personnel, including share-based\ncompensation expense, overhead attributable to manufacturing, operations and procurement, and costs associated with yield improvements, capacity utilization,\nwarranty and valuation of inventories. As the volume of sales increases, we expect cost of goods sold to increase. While our utilization rates cannot be immune to\nthe market conditions, our goal is to make them less vulnerable to market fluctuations. We believe our market diversification strategy and product growth will\ndrive higher volume of manufacturing which will improve our factory utilization rates and gross margin in the long run.\nOperating expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. We expect our operating expenses as a\npercentage of revenue to fluctuate from period to period as we continue to exercise cost control measures in response to the declining PC market as well as align\nour operating expenses to the revenue level.\nResearch and development expenses. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation\nexpense, expenses associated with new product prototypes, travel expenses, fees for engineering services provided by outside contractors and consultants,\namortization of software and design tools, depreciation of equipment and overhead costs. We continue to invest in developing new technologies and products\nutilizing our own fabrication and packaging facilities as it is critical to our long-term success. We also evaluate appropriate investment levels and stay focused on\nnew product introductions to improve our competitiveness. We expect that our research and development expenses will fluctuate from time to time.\n34\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based\ncompensation expense, product promotion costs, occupancy costs, travel expenses, expenses related to sales and marketing activities, amortization of software,\ndepreciation of equipment, maintenance costs and other expenses for general and administrative functions as well as costs for outside professional services,\nincluding legal, audit and accounting services. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to fluctuate in the near future as we continue to\nexercise cost control measures.\nIncome tax expense\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. The Company’s interim period tax provision for (benefit from) income taxes is determined using an\nestimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of the\nannual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment in such period. The Company’s\nquarterly tax provision and estimate of its annual effective tax rate are subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting its\npre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in how the Company does business.\nSignificant judgment and estimates are required in determining our worldwide income tax expense. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with\nuncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations of different jurisdictions globally. We establish accruals for potential liabilities and contingencies based\non a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of uncertain tax positions. If the recognition threshold is met, the applicable accounting\nguidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with a\ntaxing authority. If the actual tax outcome of such exposures is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, the differences will impact the income tax\nand deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Changes in the location of taxable income (loss) could result in significant changes\nin our income tax expense.\nWe record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on\nhistorical profitability and our estimate of future taxable income in a particular jurisdiction. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to\nchanges in market conditions, changes in tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the\nfuture, the deferred tax assets may increase or decrease, resulting in corresponding changes in income tax expense. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent\nupon the geographic distribution of our worldwide profits or losses, the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region where we have operations, the\navailability of tax credits and carry-forwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.\n“The Chip and Science Act of 2022”, Enacted August 2, 2022\nIn August 2022 the U.S. enacted the Chip and Science Act of 2022 (the Chips Act). The Chips Act provides incentives to semiconductor chip manufacturers\nin the United States, including providing manufacturing investment credits of 25% for investments in semiconductor manufacturing property placed in service\nafter December 31, 2022, for which construction begins before January 1, 2027. Property investments qualify for the 25% credit if, among other requirements, the\nproperty is integral to the operation of an advanced manufacturing facility, defined as having a primary purpose of manufacturing semiconductors or\nsemiconductor manufacturing equipment. Currently, we are evaluating the impact of the Chips Act to us..\n“The Inflation Reduction Act”, Enacted August 16, 2022\nIn August 2022 the United States enacted tax legislation through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA introduces a 15% corporate alternative\nminimum tax (CAMT) for corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) for any consecutive three-tax-year period preceding\nthe applicable tax year exceeds $1 billion. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after 31 December 2022. The CAMT is currently not applicable to the\nCompany.\nBermuda Corporate Income Tax for Tax Years Beginning in 2025\nThe Company is subject to income tax expense or benefit based upon pre-tax income or loss reported in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the\nprovisions of currently enacted tax laws. The parent company is incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and is subject to Bermuda law with respect to taxation.\nUnder current Bermuda law, the Company is not subject to any income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. As we have previously disclosed, the Government of\nBermuda announced in December 2023 that it enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023, potentially imposing a 15% corporate income tax (CIT) on Bermuda\ncompanies that are within the scope of the CIT, that will be effective for tax years beginning on or after\n35\nJanuary 1, 2025. In particular, the CIT applies to multinational companies with annual revenue of 750 million euros or more in the consolidated financial\nstatements of the ultimate parent entity for at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year when the CIT may apply.\nThe Company is not in a position to determine whether the annual revenues may meet and/or cross the 750 million Euro threshold for at least two of the\nfour fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year when CIT may apply. The Company continues to monitor and assess if and when it may be within the\nscope of the CIT. If we become subject to the Bermuda CIT, we may be subject to additional income taxes, which may adversely affect our financial position,\nresults of operations and our overall business.\nEquity method investment income/loss from equity investee\nWe use the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but we do not have control, as determined in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, over the operating and financial policies of the company. Effective December 2, 2021, we reduced our equity\ninterest in the JV Company below 50% of outstanding equity ownership and experienced a loss of control of the JV Company. As a result, we record our\ninvestment under equity method of accounting. Since we are unable to obtain accurate financial information from the JV Company in a timely manner, we record\nour share of earnings or losses of such affiliate on a one quarter lag.\nWe record our interest in the net earnings of the equity method investee, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions\nand amortization of basis differences, within earnings or loss from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Profits or losses related to intra-\nentity sales with the equity method investee are eliminated until realized by the investor or investee. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of\nthe\ninvestment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. Equity\nmethod goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment. Instead the total equity method investment balance, including equity method goodwill, is tested for\nimpairment. We review for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the\ndecrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth statements of income (loss), also expressed as a percentage of revenue, for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nOur historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (% of revenue)\nRevenue $ 181,887 $ 180,633 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold 137,361 129,708 75.5 % 71.8 %\nGross profit 44,526 50,925 24.5 % 28.2 %\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development 22,478 22,113 12.4 % 12.2 %\nSelling, general and administrative 22,300 19,431 12.3 % 10.8 %\nTotal operating expenses 44,778 41,544 24.7 % 23.0 %\nOperating income (loss) (252) 9,381 (0.2)% 5.2 %\nOther income (loss), net (650) 26 (0.4)% — %\nInterest income, net 453 229 0.2 % 0.1 %\nNet income (loss) before income taxes (449) 9,636 (0.4)% 5.3 %\nIncome tax expense 1,040 1,138 0.6 % 0.6 %\nNet income (loss) before loss from equity method investment (1,489) 8,498 (1.0)% 4.7 %\nEquity method investment loss from equity investee (1,007) (2,712) (0.6)% (1.5)%\nNet income (loss) $ (2,496) $ 5,786 (1.6)% 3.2 %\n36\nShare-based compensation expense was recorded as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (% of revenue)\nCost of goods sold $ 1,015 $ 212 0.6 % 0.1 %\nResearch and development 1,935 6 1.1 % — %\nSelling, general and administrative 3,952 700 2.2 % 0.4 %\nTotal $ 6,902 $ 918 3.9 % 0.5 %\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThe following is a summary of revenue by product type:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage)\nPower discrete $ 122,454 $ 121,500 $ 954 0.8 %\nPower IC 52,940 52,747 193 0.4 %\nPackaging and testing services and other 852 745 107 14.4 %\nLicense and development services 5,641 5,641 — — %\n$ 181,887 $ 180,633 $ 1,254 0.7 %\nThe following is a summary of revenue by end market:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (% of revenue)\nComputing $ 76,411 $ 70,350 42.0 % 38.9 %\nConsumer 31,696 31,090 17.4 % 17.2 %\nCommunication 35,426 31,027 19.5 % 17.2 %\nPower Supply and Industrial 31,861 41,780 17.5 % 23.2 %\nPackaging and testing services and other 852 745 0.5 % 0.4 %\nLicense and development services 5,641 5,641 3.1 % 3.1 %\n$ 181,887 $ 180,633 100.0 % 100.0 %\nTotal revenue was $181.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.3 million, or 0.7%, as compared to $180.6 million for\nthe same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.0 million and $0.2 million in sales of power discrete products and sales of power\nIC products, respectively. The increase in power discrete and power IC product sales was primarily due to a 15.8% increase in unit shipments, partially offset by a\n13.1% decrease in average selling prices compared to same quarter last year due to a shift in product mix. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by a\nsignificant increase in the computing markets, particularly in artificial intelligence and tablet products, as well as an increase in the communication markets,\nparticular in battery, partially offset by a decrease in power supply and industrial markets, particularly in quick chargers. The revenue of packaging and testing\nservices and other for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to same quarter last year, remained flat. The license and development services for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was related to the license agreement signed in February 2023 with a customer to license our proprietary SiC\ntechnology and to provide 24-month engineering and development services.\n37\nCost of goods sold and gross profit\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage)\nCost of goods sold $ 137,361 $ 129,708 $ 7,653 5.9 %\nPercentage of revenue 75.5 % 71.8 %\nGross profit $ 44,526 $ 50,925 $ (6,399) (12.6)%\nPercentage of revenue 24.5 % 28.2 %\nCost of goods sold was $137.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $7.7 million or 5.9%, as compared to $129.7 million\nfor the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to 0.7% increase in revenue. Gross margin decreased by 3.7 percentage points to 24.5% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 28.2% for the same quarter last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher material\ncosts and less favorable product mix during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nResearch and development expenses\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage)\nResearch and development expenses $ 22,478 $ 22,113 $ 365 1.7 %\nResearch and development expenses were $22.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $0.4 million, or 1.7%, as compared\nto $22.1 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributable to a $1.9 million increase in share-based compensation expense as a result\nof a modification of market-based restricted stock units in August 2024, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in product prototyping engineering expense as\na result of decreased engineering activities, as well as a $0.6 million decrease in employee compensation and benefit expense mainly due to decreased headcount\nand lower bonus expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage)\nSelling, general and administrative $ 22,300 $ 19,431 $ 2,869 14.8 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $22.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.9 million, or 14.8%, as\ncompared to $19.4 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to a $3.3 million increase in share-based compensation expense as a\nresult of a modification of market-based restricted stock units in August 2024, and $0.2 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expenses\nprimarily due to increased headcount, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in audit fees, a $0.2 million decrease in legal fees and $0.1 million decrease in\nconsulting fees.\nOther income (loss), net\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage)\nOther income (loss), net $ (650) $ 26 $ (676) (2,600.0)%\n38\nOther income (loss), net decreased by $0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year primarily due to\n$0.1 million of an impairment of a privately-held investment, as well as an increase in foreign currency exchange loss as a result of the depreciation of RMB\nagainst USD.\nInterest income, net\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage)\nInterest income, net $ 453 $ 229 $ 224 97.8 %\nInterest income (expense), net increased by $0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same quarter last year\nprimarily due to lower interest expense as a result of less outstanding loan balance in current quarter.\nIncome tax expense\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in percentage)\nIncome tax expense $ 1,040 $ 1,138 $ (98) (8.6)%\nThe Company recognized income tax expense of approximately $1.0 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The income tax expense of $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included a $0.08 million discrete tax expense. The income\ntax expense of $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a $0.05 million discrete tax expense. Excluding the discrete income tax\nitems, the income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (65.8)% and 15.7%, respectively. The changes in the tax expense and effective tax rate between the\nperiods resulted primarily from changes in the mix of earnings in various geographic jurisdictions between the current year and the same period of last year as\nwell as from reporting pretax book loss of $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $6.9 million of pretax book income for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Company files its income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The tax years 2004 to 2024 remain open to examination\nby U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The tax years 2018 to 2024 remain open to examination by foreign tax authorities.\nThe Company's income tax returns are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. In\naccordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting\nfrom these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $10.1 million, of which $6.9 million, if recognized, would reduce the\neffective income tax rate in future periods. If the Company's estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, then a further charge\nto expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in\ntax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. The Company does not anticipate any material\nchanges to its uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal need for liquidity and capital resources is to maintain sufficient working capital to support our operations and to invest adequate capital\nexpenditures to grow our business. To date, we finance our operations and capital expenditures primarily through funds generated from operations and\nborrowings under our term loans, financing lease and other debt agreements.\n39\nIn March 2024, Bank of Communications Limited in China provided a line of credit facility to one of the Company's\nsubsidiaries in China. The purpose of the credit facility is to provide working capital borrowings. The Company could borrow up to approximately RMB\n140 million or $20.0 million based on currency exchange rate between RMB and U.S. Dollar on September 30, 2024 with a maturity date of March 15, 2025. As\nof September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance for this loan.\nIn December 2023, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China provided a line of credit facility to one of the Company's\nsubsidiaries in China. The purpose of the credit facility was to provide working capital borrowings. The Company could borrow up to approximately RMB\n72.0 million, or $10.3 million based on currency exchange rate between RMB and U.S. Dollar on September 30, 2024, with a maturity date of December 31,\n2024. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance for this loan.\nIn September 2023, China Construction Bank provided a line of credit facility to one of the Company's subsidiaries in\nChina. The purpose of the credit facility is to provide working capital borrowings. The Company could borrow up to approximately RMB 50 million or\n$7.1 million based on currency exchange rate between RMB and U.S. Dollar on September 30, 2024 with a maturity date of September 8, 2025. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance for this loan.\nOn February 6, 2023, we entered into a license and engineering service agreement with a leading power semiconductor automotive supplier related to our\nSilicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET and diode technology. Pursuant to the agreement, we license and provide 24-month engineering support for our proprietary SiC\ntechnology to the supplier for a total fee of $45.0 million, consisted of an upfront fee and milestone payments of $18.0 million, $6.8 million and $9.0 million paid\nto us in the March, July 2023 and February 2024, respectively, and the remaining amount to be paid upon our achievements of specified business and product\nmilestones. In addition, we entered an accompanying supply agreement with the supplier to provide it with limited wafer supply.\nIn September 2021, Jireh Semiconductor Incorporated (“Jireh”), one of the wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a financing arrangement agreement with\na company (“Lender”) for the lease and purchase of a machinery equipment manufactured by a supplier. This agreement has a 5 years term, after which Jireh has\nthe option to purchase the equipment for $1. The implied interest rate was 4.75% per annum which was adjustable based on every five basis point increase in 60-\nmonth U.S. Treasury Notes, until the final installation and acceptance of the equipment. The total purchase price of this equipment was euro 12.0 million. In April\n2021, Jireh made a down payment of euro 6.0 million, representing 50% of the total purchase price of the equipment, to the supplier. In June 2022, the equipment\nwas delivered to Jireh after Lender paid 40% of the total purchase price, for euro 4.8 million, to the supplier on behalf of Jireh. In September 2022, Lender paid\nthe remaining 10% payment for the total purchase price and reimbursed Jireh for the 50% down payment, after the installation and configuration of the\nequipment. The title of the equipment was transferred to Lender following such payment. The agreement was amended with fixed implied interest rate of 7.51%\nand monthly payment of principal and interest effective in October 2022. Other terms remain the same. In addition, Jireh purchased hardware for the machine\nunder this financing arrangement. The purchase price of this hardware was $0.2 million. The financing arrangement is secured by this equipment and other\nequipment which had the net book value of $13.2 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of this debt financing was\n$8.5 million.\nOn August 18, 2021, Jireh entered into a term loan agreement with a financial institution (the “Bank”) in an amount up to $45.0 million for the purpose of\nexpanding and upgrading the Company’s fabrication facility located in Oregon. The obligation under the loan agreement is secured by substantially all assets of\nJireh and guaranteed by the Company. The agreement has a 5.5 year term and matures on February 16, 2027. Jireh is required to make consecutive quarterly\npayments of principal and interest. The loan accrues interest based on adjusted SOFR plus the applicable margin based on the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThis agreement contains customary restrictive covenants and includes certain financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain. Jireh drew down\n$45.0 million on February 16, 2022 with the first payment of principal beginning in October 2022. As of September 30, 2024, Jireh was in compliance with these\ncovenants and the outstanding balance of this loan was $27.0 million.\nOn August 9, 2019, one of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Borrower”) entered into a factoring agreement with Hongkong and Shanghai\nBanking Corporation Limited (“HSBC”), whereby the Borrower assigns certain of its accounts receivable with recourse. This factoring agreement allows the\nBorrower to borrow up to 70% of the net amount of its eligible accounts receivable of the Borrower with a maximum amount of $30.0 million. The interest rate is\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), plus 2.01% per annum. The Company is the guarantor for this agreement. The Company is accounting\nfor this transaction as a secured borrowing. In addition, any cash held in the restricted bank account controlled by HSBC has a legal right of offset against the\nborrowing. This agreement, with certain financial covenants required, has no expiration date. On August 11, 2021, the Borrower signed an agreement with HSBC\nto reduce the borrowing maximum amount to $8.0 million with certain financial covenants required. Other terms remain the same. As of September 30, 2024, the\n40\nBorrower was in compliance with these covenants. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance and the Company had unused credit of\napproximately $8.0 million.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including\nworking capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next twelve months. In the long-term, we may require additional capital due to changing business\nconditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our cash is insufficient to meet our needs, we may\nseek to raise capital through debt financing. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and may include operating and\nfinancial covenants that would restrict our operations. If we decide to raise capital through equity financing, the issuance of additional equity may result in\ndilution to our shareholders. We cannot be certain that any financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had $176.2 million and $175.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, respectively. Our\ncash, cash equivalents and restricted cash primarily consist of cash on hand, restricted cash, and short-term bank deposits with original maturities of three months\nor less. Of the $176.2 million and $175.5 million cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $92.7 million and $55.0 million, respectively, are deposited with\nfinancial institutions outside the United States.\nThe following table shows our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 11,021 $ 13,823\nNet cash used in investing activities (6,738) (12,510)\nNet cash used in financing activities (3,706) (2,999)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 105 (135)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 682 $ (1,821)\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from net loss of $2.5 million\nand non-cash expenses of $22.4 million, partially offset by net changes in assets and liabilities using cash of $8.8 million. The non-cash expenses of $22.4 million\nprimarily included $6.9 million of share-based compensation expense, $14.6 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $1.0 million of loss from equity\ninvestment, $0.1 million of impairment of a privately-held investment and $0.2 million of deferred income taxes. The net changes in assets and liabilities of $8.8\nmillion were primarily due to a $12.0 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of timing of the shipments and payments collected, a $3.1 million\nincrease in contract assets, a $0.1 million increase in other current and long-term assets due to increase in advance payments to vendors, a $2.6 million decrease\nin deferred revenue, a $4.7 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments, partially\noffset by $10.8 million decrease in inventories, a $3.5 million increase in net payable to equity investee, and $0.6 million increase in income taxes payable.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to $6.9 million in purchases\nof property and equipment, partially offset by $0.2 million government grants related to equipment.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to $2.9 million in repayments\nof borrowings, $0.2 million in payment of finance lease obligations, and $0.7 million in common shares acquired to settle withholding tax related to vesting of\nrestricted stock units, partially offset by $0.1 million of proceeds from exercise of stock options.\n41\nCommitments\nSee Note 12 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of\ncommitments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThere were no material changes outside of our ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recent\naccounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated\nherein by reference.\n42\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere have been no material changes in the market risks previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market\nRisk,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 23, 2024.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nManagement’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective and provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or\nsubmit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing\nsimilar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitation on Effectiveness of Controls\nWhile our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that their respective\nobjectives will be met, we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of\npreventing or detecting all errors and all fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the control system's objectives will be met.\n43\nPART II.
