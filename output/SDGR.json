(Nasdaq: SDGR), today announced that it is broadening and\naccelerating its initiative to expand the company’s computational platform to predict toxicology risk early in drug\ndiscovery. The goal of the initiative, announced earlier this year, is to develop a computational solution designed\nto improve the properties of novel drug development candidates and reduce the risk of development failure\nassociated with binding to o\u0000-target proteins, which can be associated with serious side e\u0000ects.\nIn conjunction with this expansion, Schrödinger received an additional $9.5 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates\nFoundation, which follows the initial $10 million grant from the Gates Foundation in July 2024. The additional\nfunding enables Schrödinger to more rapidly access relevant experimental structures and extends the funding for\nthis initiative to April 2026. Once developed, the technology will be available to the Gates Foundation’s grantees\naround the world to help speed the development of new drugs against diseases that disproportionately a\u0000ect\npeople in low- and middle-income countries. These tools will also be available to Schrödinger’s software customers\nand will be used to advance Schrödinger’s proprietary drug discovery programs and collaborations.\n“This additional funding allows us to accelerate and broaden the scope of our initiative to rapidly develop high-\nquality computational models to address o\u0000-target toxicity, a signi\u0000cant cause of drug development failure,” stated\nRamy Farid, Ph.D., chief executive o\u0000cer at Schrödinger. “We are grateful to the Gates Foundation for their\ncontinued support and shared vision of using computation to reduce the potential for safety issues in preclinical\nand clinical research and signi\u0000cantly lower the cost and risk of drug development.”\nSchrödinger has already generated several computational predictive models of o\u0000-target drug activity. The\n1\ncompany’s recent advances characterizing the structure of safety-related proteins such as hERG (recently published\nin Cell ) and cytochrome P450 enzymes are examples of these e\u0000orts.\nThe majority of revenue associated with the additional funding is expected to be recognized in 2025.\nAbout Schrödinger\nSchrödinger is transforming molecular discovery with its computational platform, which enables the discovery of\nnovel, highly optimized molecules for drug development and materials design.

(Nasdaq: SDGR) today announced financial results for the\nthird quarter of 2024 and provided a business update. In a separate press release issued earlier today,\nSchrödinger announced a multi-target research and licensing collaboration with Novartis. Under the terms of the\nagreement, Novartis will pay Schrödinger $150 million upfront, and Schrödinger will also be eligible to receive\nup to $2.3 billion in milestone payments. Schrödinger also announced an expanded three-year software\nagreement that substantially increases Novartis's access to Schrödinger’s computational predictive modeling\ntechnology and enterprise informatics platform.\n“We have continued to make important advances across our business this year. Recent progress, including the\ncollaboration with Novartis and milestones achieved by our co-founded companies underscore the strength of\nour business model,” said Ramy Farid, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Schrödinger. “While our third quarter\nsoftware revenue was slightly below our expectations, we are excited about the opportunities we have in the\nfourth quarter to drive software growth through increasing utilization among our customers. Our proprietary\npipeline is progressing, and we look forward to sharing the initial Phase 1 data from each of our three lead\nprograms next year.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n• Total revenue for the third quarter was $35.3 million, compared to $42.6 million in the third quarter of\n2023.\n• Software revenue for the third quarter increased 10% to $31.9 million, compared to $28.9 million in the\nthird quarter of 2023. The increase was due to the growing contribution of hosted licenses, partially\noffset by multi-year on-premise contracts signed in the third quarter of 2023.\n• Drug discovery revenue was $3.4 million for the third quarter, compared to $13.7 million in the third\nquarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2023 included accelerated recognition of deferred revenue\nassociated with programs no longer in the company’s collaborative portfolio.\n• Software gross margin decreased to 73% for the third quarter, compared to 76% in the third quarter of\n2023, reflecting lower profitability of revenue associated with the predictive toxicology initiative.\n• Operating expenses were $86.2 million for the third quarter, compared to $79.8 million for the third\nquarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher R&D expenses.\n• Other income, which includes changes in fair value of equity investments and interest income, was\n$30.2 million for the third quarter, compared to other expense of $8.7 million for the third quarter of\n2023, primarily reflecting changes in fair value of the company’s equity investments.\n• Net loss for the third quarter was $38.1 million, compared to net loss of $62.0 million in the third quarter\nof 2023.\n• At September 30, 2024, Schrödinger had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable\nsecurities of $398.4 million, compared to $468.8 million at December 31, 2023.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\n(in millions)\nTotal revenue $ 35.3 $ 42.6 (17)%\nSoftware revenue 31.9 28.9 10%\nDrug discovery revenue 3.4 13.7 (75)%\nSoftware gross margin 73 % 76 %\nOperating expenses $ 86.2 $ 79.8 7.9%\nOther income (expense) $ 30.2 $ (8.7) —\nNet loss $ (38.1) $ (62.0) —\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Schrödinger reported non-GAAP net losses of $63.7\nmillion and $174.2 million, respectively, compared to non-GAAP net losses of $50.4 million and $134.8 million\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. A reconciliation of non-GAAP net loss to GAAP net\n(loss) income can be found in “Non-GAAP Information” and financial tables below.\n2024 Financial Outlook\nToday Schrödinger updated its 2024 full-year financial guidance. The company’s updated financial expectations\nfor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, are as follows:\n• Software revenue growth is now expected to range from 8% to 13%.\n• Drug discovery revenue is now expected to range from $20 million to $30 million.\n• Software gross margin is expected to be slightly lower than 2023 and in the range of 2022 based on the\neffect of the research grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n• Operating expense growth in 2024 is expected to range from 8% to 10%.\n• Cash used for operating activities in 2024 is expected to be above cash used for operating activities in\n2023, depending on the timing of cash received from collaborations.\n“We have increased the lower end of our software revenue growth guidance for the year, reflecting our\nconfidence in the opportunities to meet our growth goals and the continued enthusiasm for the deployment of\ncomputation in drug discovery across the industry,” stated Geoff Porges, MBBS, chief financial officer of\nSchrödinger. “Collaborations continue to be an important element of our business model, and we are pleased\nNovartis has recognized the value of our platform and the capabilities of our team with this agreement. This\nquarter we added $48 million to our cash balance as a result of Lilly’s acquisition of Morphic and expect to add\neven more capital from the payments associated with the collaboration announced today.”\nRecent Highlights\nCollaborators, Partners, and Co-Founded Companies\n• Today Schrödinger announced a multi-target research and licensing collaboration and expanded\nsoftware licensing agreement with Novartis. The collaboration agreement is intended to advance\nmultiple development candidates into Novartis’s portfolio for further development and\ncommercialization. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis will pay Schrödinger $150 million\nupfront, and Schrödinger will also be eligible to receive up to $892 million in research, development and\nregulatory milestone payments. Additionally, Schrödinger is eligible for up to $1.38 billion in commercial\nmilestones and tiered mid single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net sales of each product\ncommercialized by Novartis. Schrödinger also announced an expanded three-year software agreement\nthat substantially increases Novartis's access to Schrödinger’s computational predictive modeling\ntechnology and enterprise informatics platform.\n• In November, Nimbus Therapeutics, a company co-founded by Schrödinger, announced updated data\nfrom its Phase 1/2 clinical study of NDI-101150 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual\nMeeting. NDI-101150 is a HPK1 inhibitor in development for the treatment of solid tumors.\n• In October, Ajax Therapeutics, a company co-founded by Schrödinger, announced the dosing of the first\npatient in the Phase 1 study of AJ1-11095, a novel JAK2 inhibitor, in patients with primary myelofibrosis,\npost-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocytopenia myelofibrosis.\n• In August, Lilly completed its acquisition of Morphic, a company co-founded by Schrödinger, at the\nannounced acquisition price of $57 per share, or approximately $3.2 billion. Schrödinger tendered\n834,968 shares for an aggregate of $47.6 million in cash. Schrödinger remains entitled to low single-\ndigit royalties on acquired Morphic clinical development programs, including MORF-057.\nProprietary Pipeline\n• In October, Schrödinger presented preclinical data on SGR-3515, its Wee1/Myt1 inhibitor, at the\nEORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium (ENA 2024). The data demonstrated that SGR-3515 had a favorable\npharmacological profile and dosing schedule that supports evaluating intermittent dosing in patients.\n• In October, Schrödinger presented preclinical data from the company’s discovery-stage PRMT5\nprogram at ENA 2024. The poster reviewed the discovery of a series of highly selective PRMT5-MTA\ninhibitors, following the use of Schrödinger’s computational platform to identify a novel molecular series\nwith potential for best-in-class pharmacological properties.\n• Schrödinger continues to advance SGR-1505, its MALT1 inhibitor, through the Phase 1 dose-escalation\nstudy in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. The company expects to report initial\nclinical data from this study in the first half of 2025.\n• SGR-2921, the company’s CDC7 inhibitor, is progressing through a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in\npatients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Schrödinger\nexpects to report initial clinical data from this study in the second half of 2025.\n• The Phase 1 study of SGR-3515 continues to enroll patients with advanced solid tumors at sites in the\nU.S. and Canada. Initial clinical data from this study is expected in the second half of 2025.\nPlatform\n• In the third quarter, Schrödinger scientists published five papers highlighting ongoing research to\nadvance the platform, including a method for treating significant conformational changes in free energy\nsimulations of protein-ligand binding, a model of coarse grained simulation of mRNA-loaded lipid\nnanoparticle self-assembly, and a review of recent developments and unique features in its quantum\nmechanics software package.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nSchrödinger will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and the recently\nannounced Novartis collaboration on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET. The live webcast can be\naccessed under “News & Events” in the investors section of Schrödinger’s website,\nhttps://ir.schrodinger.com/news-and-events/event-calendar. To participate in the live call, please register for the\ncall here. It is recommended that participants register at least 15 minutes in advance of the call. Once\nregistered, participants will receive the dial-in information. The archived webcast will be available on\nSchrödinger’s website for approximately 90 days following the event.\nNon-GAAP Information\nIncluded in this press release is certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The company presents non-GAAP net\nincome (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, which exclude gains and losses on equity\ninvestments, changes in fair value of equity investments, and income tax benefits and expenses. Adjusting net\nincome to exclude the impact of these items results in a financial presentation for the company without the\nimpact of our equity investments and tax benefits and expenses. Management believes non-GAAP net income\n(loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share are useful measures for investors, taken in conjunction with\nthe company’s GAAP financial statements because they provide greater period-over-period comparability with\nrespect to the company’s operating performance, by excluding non-cash mark-to-market and other valuation\nadjustments for the company’s equity investments, non-recurring cash distributions from the company’s equity\ninvestments and the tax impact of these distributions that are not reflective of the ongoing operating\nperformance of the business. However, the non-GAAP measures should be considered only in addition to, not\nas a substitute for or as superior to, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share or other financial\nmeasures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nOther companies in Schrödinger’s industry may calculate non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net\nincome (loss) per share differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. For a\nreconciliation of non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to GAAP net income\n(loss) and GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, please refer to the tables at the end of this press\nrelease.\nAbout Schrödinger\nSchrödinger is transforming molecular discovery with its computational platform, which enables the discovery of\nnovel, highly optimized molecules for drug development and materials design.

All statements, other than\nstatements of historical fact, contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue,\nprojected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, are forward-looking statements. The words “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,”\n“could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” or the negative of these\nwords or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\nThe forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report include, among other things, statements about:\n• the potential advantages of our physics-based computational platform;\n• our strategic plans to accelerate the growth of our software business and acquire new customers;\n• our research and development efforts for our proprietary drug discovery programs and our computational platform, including the initiative to expand\nthe application of our platform to predict toxicity associated with binding to off-target proteins;\n• our drug discovery collaborations, including the initiation, timing, progress and results of such collaborations;\n• our estimates or expectations regarding any milestone or other payments we may receive from drug discovery collaborations, including pursuant to\nour collaboration agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Novartis Pharma AG;\n• our proprietary drug discovery programs, including the initiation, timing, progress, and results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n• our plans to submit investigational new drug applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for our proprietary drug discovery programs;\n• our plans to discover and develop product candidates and to maximize their commercial potential by advancing such product candidates ourselves or\nin collaboration with others;\n• our plans to leverage the synergies between our businesses;\n• the timing of, the ability to submit applications for and the ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for any product candidates we or one of\nour collaborators may develop;\n• the potential advantages of our drug discovery collaborations and our proprietary drug discovery programs;\n• the rate and degree of market acceptance of our software solutions;\n• the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of any product we or any of our collaborators may develop;\n• our estimates regarding the potential market opportunity for our software solutions and any product candidate we or any of our collaborators may\ndevelop;\n• our sales and marketing capabilities and strategy;\n• our intellectual property position;\n• our ability to identify technologies with significant commercial potential that are consistent with our commercial objectives;\n• our expectations regarding our ability to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements with our cash, cash equivalents, and\nmarketable securities;\n• our expectations related to the use of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities;\n• our expectations related to the key drivers of our performance;\n• the impact of government laws and regulations;\n2\nTable of Contents\n• our competitive position and expectations regarding developments and projections relating to our competitors and any competing products,\ntechnologies, or therapies that are or become available;\n• our ability to maintain and establish collaborations or obtain additional funding;\n• our reliance on key personnel and our ability to identify, recruit, and retain skilled personnel;\n• the potential impact of public health epidemics or pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n• the potential impact of geopolitical and global economic developments.\nWe may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions, and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we\nmake. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this Quarterly Report, particularly in “Risk Factor Summary” below and Part II, Item\n1A. “Risk Factors”, that we believe could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Moreover, we operate in\na competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties\nthat could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of\nany future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, or investments we may make or enter into.\nYou should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission with the understanding that our actual\nfuture results may be materially different from what we expect. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are made as of the date of this\nQuarterly Report, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,\nexcept as required by applicable law.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon\ninformation available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information\nmay be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available\nrelevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, we use the terms “company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Quarterly Report to refer to Schrödinger, Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries.\n3\nTable of Contents\nRISK FACTOR SUMMARY\nOur business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. Below we summarize what we believe are\nthe principal risk factors but these risks are not the only ones we face, and you should carefully review and consider the full discussion of our risk factors in the section\ntitled “Risk Factors”, together with the other information in this Quarterly Report.\n• We have a history of significant operating losses, and we expect to incur losses over the next several years.\n• If we are unable to increase sales of our software, increase revenue from our drug discovery collaborations, or if we and our current and future\ncollaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize drug products, our revenues may be insufficient for us to achieve or maintain\nprofitability.\n• Our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\n• If our existing customers do not renew their licenses, do not buy additional solutions from us, or renew at lower prices, our business and operating\nresults will suffer.\n• A significant portion of our revenues are generated by sales to life sciences industry customers, and factors that adversely affect this industry could\nadversely affect our software sales.\n• The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be\nadversely affected.\n• We may never realize a return on our investment of resources and cash in our drug discovery collaborations.\n• Although we believe that our computational platform has the potential to identify more promising molecules than traditional methods and to accelerate\ndrug discovery, our focus on using our platform technology to discover and design molecules with therapeutic potential may not result in the\ndiscovery and development of commercially viable products for us or our collaborators.\n• We may not be successful in our efforts to identify, discover or develop product candidates and may fail to capitalize on programs, collaborations, or\nproduct candidates that may present a greater commercial opportunity or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n• As a company, we have very limited experience in clinical development, which may adversely impact the likelihood that we will be successful in\nadvancing our programs.\n• We will likely require additional capital to fund our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all or\ngenerate cash flows necessary to maintain or expand our operations, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business,\noperations, and financial condition.\n• Conducting successful clinical trials requires the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and\nrecruit.\n• We rely on, and plan to continue to rely on, third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including\nfailing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, which may prevent or delay our ability to seek or obtain marketing approval for or\ncommercialize our product candidates or otherwise harm our business.\n• The outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and the results of our clinical\ntrials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\n• If we fail to comply with our obligations under our existing license agreements with Columbia University, under any of our other intellectual property\nlicenses, or under any future intellectual property licenses, or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our current or any\nfuture licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\n4\nTable of Contents\n• If we are unable to obtain, maintain, enforce, and protect patent protection for our technology and product candidates or if the scope of the patent\nprotection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours,\nand our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our technology and product candidates may be adversely affected.\n• Our internal information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, contractors, or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, loss\nor leakage of data, and other disruptions, which could result in a material disruption of our services, compromise sensitive information related to our\nbusiness, or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\n• Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\n• We are pursuing multiple business strategies and expect to expand our development and regulatory capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter\ndifficulties in managing our multiple business units and our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\n• Our executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, have the ability to influence all matters submitted to\nstockholders for approval.\n• Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\n5\nTable of Contents\nPART I—FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands, except for share and per share amounts and note 3(c))\n(1) Description of Business\nSchrödinger, Inc. (the \"Company\") has developed a differentiated, physics-based computational platform that enables discovery of high-quality, novel\nmolecules for drug development and materials applications more rapidly and at a lower cost, compared to traditional methods. The Company's software platform is\nlicensed by biopharmaceutical and industrial companies, academic institutions, and government laboratories around the world. The Company is also applying its\ncomputational platform to advance a broad pipeline of drug discovery programs in collaboration with leading biopharmaceutical companies. In addition, the Company\nuses its computational platform to discover novel molecules for its pipeline of proprietary drug discovery programs, which the Company is advancing through\npreclinical and clinical development.\nIn February 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (\"Leerink Partners\"), as sales agent, with\nrespect to an at-the-market offering program (the \"ATM\") under which the Company could offer and sell, from time to time pursuant to its Registration Statement on\nForm S-3, shares of common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000, through Leerink Partners. The amended and restated sales agreement amends\nand restates the original sales agreement that the Company entered into with Leerink Partners with respect to the ATM in May 2023, which is no longer in effect. During\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, zero and 323,085 shares of common stock, respectively, were sold under the ATM for total net proceeds of zero\nand $8,691, respectively, and gross proceeds of zero and $8,868, respectively, before deducting sales agent commissions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had\n$241,132 of common stock remaining available for sale under the ATM.\n(2) Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic\n280) — Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet adopted ASU 2023-07 and is still evaluating the impact of the adoption on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) — Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public business\nentities to disclose specific categories in the tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. This\nstandard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, on a\nprospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet adopted ASU 2023-09 and is still evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\n(Subtopic 220-40) — Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. which requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of specified information about\ncertain costs and expenses. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2027, on a prospective basis, with early adoption and retrospective application permitted. The Company has not yet adopted ASU 2024-03 and is still\nevaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.\n(b) Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related interim disclosures have been prepared in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") and pursuant to the rules\n11\nTable of Contents\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") for the interim financial information. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ninclude all adjustments necessary, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, to fairly state the financial position and the results of the Company’s operations and\ncash flows for interim periods in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by the SEC’s rules and regulations for interim reporting. Interim period results are not\nnecessarily indicative of results of operations or cash flows for a full year or any subsequent interim period. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the assumptions used in the allocation of revenue and estimates regarding the progress of\ncompleting performance obligations under collaboration agreements. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n(c) Principles of Consolidation\nThe Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Schrödinger, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries, and its\nvariable interest entity. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional currency for foreign entities is the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company accounts for investments over which it has significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.\n(d) Restricted Cash\nRestricted cash primarily consists of letters of credit held with the Company’s financial institution related to facility leases and is classified as current in the\nCompany’s balance sheets based on the maturity of the underlying letters of credit. The Company also has restricted cash related to a certificate of deposit held as\ncollateral for its credit card facility. Additionally, funds received from certain grants are restricted as to their use and are therefore classified as restricted cash.\n(e) Concentrations\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and contract assets, which\nrepresent contracted unbilled receivables.\nThe Company does not require customers to provide collateral to support accounts receivable. If deemed necessary, credit reviews of significant new customers\nmay be performed prior to extending credit. The determination of a customer’s ability to pay requires judgment, and failure to collect from a customer can adversely\naffect revenue, cash flows, and results of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for 16% of total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, two customers accounted for 15% and 11%\nof total accounts receivable, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, two customers accounted for 39% and 18% of total contract assets, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, two customers accounted for 42% and 22% of total contract assets, respectively.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, one customer accounted for 28% and 29% of total revenue, respectively.\n(f) Income Taxes\nThe Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is estimated to become more likely than\nnot that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company currently maintains a full valuation allowance against existing net deferred\ntax assets.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if such positions are deemed \"more likely than not\" capable of being sustained. Interest and\npenalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are included within income tax expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n(g) Equity Investments\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has entered, and may continue to enter, into collaboration agreements with companies to perform drug design\nservices for such companies in exchange for equity ownership stakes in such companies. If it is determined that the Company has control over the investee, the investee\nis consolidated in the financial statements. If the investee is consolidated with the Company and less than 100% of the equity is owned by the Company, the Company\nwill present non-controlling interest to represent the portion of the investee owned by other investors. If it is determined that the Company does not have control over\nthe investee, the Company evaluates the investment for the ability to exercise significant influence.\nEquity investments over which the Company has significant influence may be accounted for under equity method accounting in accordance with Accounting\nStandards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 323 (\"Topic 323\"), Equity Method and Joint Ventures. If it is determined that the Company does not have significant influence\nover the investee, and there is no readily determinable fair value for the investment, the equity investment may be accounted for at cost less impairment, in accordance\nwith ASC Topic 321 (\"Topic 321\"), Investments - Equity Securities.\nFor further information regarding the Company’s equity investments, see Note 4, Fair Value Measurements and Note 10, Equity Investments.\n(h) Net (Loss) Income per Share Attributable to Common and Limited Common Stockholders\nThe outstanding equity of the Company consists of common stock and limited common stock. Under the Company’s certificate of incorporation, the rights of\nthe holders of common stock and limited common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Holders of limited common stock are precluded\nfrom voting such shares in any election of directors or on the removal of directors. Limited common stock may be converted into common stock at any time at the\noption of the stockholder.\nUndistributed earnings allocated to the participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income (loss) attributable to common and\nlimited common stockholders. Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common and limited common stockholders by\nthe weighted-average number of shares of common and limited common stock outstanding during the period.\nFor the calculation of diluted net income, net income attributable to common and limited common stockholders for basic net income is adjusted by the effect of\ndilutive securities, including awards under the Company’s equity compensation plans. Diluted net income per share attributable to common and limited common\nstockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net income attributable to common and limited common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully\ndiluted shares of common and limited common stock outstanding.\n(3) Revenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the\nCompany expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied either over time or at a point in time,\nwhich can result in different revenue recognition patterns.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe following table illustrates the timing of the Company’s revenue recognition patterns:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSoftware products and services – point in time 40.3 % 37.0 % 43.0 % 36.8 %\nSoftware products and services – over time 50.0 30.9 41.5 26.6\nDrug Discovery – point in time — — 7.6 19.1\nDrug Discovery – over time 9.7 32.1 7.9 17.5\n(a) Software Products and Services\nThe Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of licenses, products and services, some of which are distinct and are accounted for\nas separate performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each\nperformance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. Revenue is recognized net of any sale and value-added taxes collected from customers and\nsubsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nThe Company’s software business derives revenue from five sources: (i) on-premise software license fees, (ii) hosted software subscription fees, (iii) software\nmaintenance fees, (iv) professional services fees, and (v) contributions.\nOn-premise software. The Company’s on-premise software license arrangements grant customers the right to use its software on their own in-house servers or\ntheir own cloud instances for a specified term, typically for one year, though in recent years, the Company has entered into a small number of large multi-year on-\npremise software license agreements. The Company recognizes revenue for on-premise software license fees upfront, either upon transfer of control of the license or the\neffective date of the agreement, whichever is later. In instances where the timing of the transfer of control differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company considers\nwhether a significant financing component exists. The Company has elected the practical expedient to not assess for significant financing where the term is less than one\nyear. The Company’s updates and upgrades are not integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. Payments typically are received upfront or annually.\nHosted software. Hosted software revenue consists primarily of fees to provide the Company’s customers with hosted licenses, which allows these customers to\naccess the Company’s cloud-based software solution on their own hardware without taking control of the licenses, and is recognized ratably over the term of the\narrangement, which is typically one year, though in recent years, the Company has entered into a small number of large multi-year hosted software license agreements.\nWhen a customer enters into a hosted arrangement for which revenue is recognized over time, the amount paid upfront that is not recognized in the current period is\nincluded in deferred revenue in the Company's statement of financial position until the period in which it is recognized.\nSoftware maintenance. Software maintenance includes technical support, updates, and upgrades related to the Company's on-premise software licenses.\nSoftware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Software maintenance activities are performed in connection with the use of the\nCompany's on-premise software, and may fluctuate from period to period.\nProfessional services. Professional services include training, technical setup, installation or assisting customers with modeling services, where the Company\nuses its software to perform tasks such as virtual screening on behalf of the Company’s customers. These services are generally not related to the core functionality of\nthe Company’s software and are recognized as revenue when resources are consumed. Since each professional services agreement represents a unique, ad hoc\nengagement, professional services revenue may fluctuate from period to period.\nSoftware contribution revenue. Software contribution revenue consists of funds received under non-reciprocal agreements with Gates Ventures, LLC and the\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The agreement with Gates Ventures, LLC was originally entered into in June 2020 and further extended through August 2026. The\nagreement is an unconditional non-exchange contribution without restrictions. Revenue was recognized annually from June 2020 through June 2022 and upon extension\nof the agreement in August 2023, when invoiced, in accordance with ASC Topic 958, Not-for-Profit Entities (\"Topic 958\"), as the agreement is not an exchange\ntransaction.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe agreement with Gates Ventures, LLC initially covered the period from June 23, 2020 through June 22, 2023 for total consideration of up to $3,000. The\nCompany recognized revenue of $1,000 upon entry into the agreement and $1,000 upon each of the first and second anniversary of the agreement. The agreement was\nthen extended through August 13, 2026 and provides for total additional consideration of up to $6,000. The Company recognized revenue of $1,800 upon extension of\nthe agreement in August 2023 and $2,000 upon the first anniversary of the extension. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no deferred\nrevenue balance related to this agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no accounts receivable related to this agreement.\nThe Company entered into a one-year agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in July 2024 to fund the initiative to accelerate the expansion of the\nCompany's computational platform to predict toxicity associated with binding to off-target proteins. Revenue is recognized as conditions are met and on a cost\nreimbursement basis in accordance with Topic 958. The Company recognized revenue of $1,124 related to this agreement during the three months ended September 30,\n2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a $3,876 deferred revenue balance related to this agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no\naccounts receivable related to this agreement.\nThe following table presents the revenue recognized from the sources of software products and services revenue:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOn-premise software $ 12,250 $ 13,806 $ 48,627 $ 50,564\nHosted software 8,814 5,463 24,077 14,366\nSoftware maintenance 5,658 5,752 17,393 17,378\nProfessional services 2,038 2,083 7,482 6,361\nRevenue from contracts with customers 28,760 27,104 97,579 88,669\nSoftware contribution 3,124 1,800 3,124 1,800\nTotal software revenue $ 31,884 $ 28,904 $ 100,703 $ 90,469\n(b) Drug Discovery\nDrug discovery services. Revenue from drug discovery and collaboration services contracts is recognized either over time or at a point in time, typically by\nusing costs incurred, hours expended to measure progress, or based on the achievement of milestones. Payments for services are generally due upfront at the start of a\ncontract, upon achieving milestones stated in a contract, or upon consumption of resources. Services may at times include variable consideration, and the Company has\nestimated the amount of consideration that is variable using the most likely amount method. The Company evaluates milestones on a case-by-case basis, including\nwhether there are factors outside the Company’s control that could result in a significant reversal of revenue, and the likelihood and magnitude of a potential reversal. If\nachievement of a milestone is not considered probable, the Company constrains (reduces) variable consideration to exclude the milestone payment until it is probable of\nbeing achieved. Upon removal of the constraint on variable consideration, revenue may be recognized at a point in time or over time by applying the allocation guidance\nof ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"Topic 606\").\nAs of September 30, 2024, milestones not yet achieved that were determined to be probable of achievement totaled $500, of which $500 was recognized as\ndrug discovery milestone revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, there were no milestones not yet achieved that were\ndetermined to be probable of achievement, and no corresponding drug discovery milestone revenue was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nDrug discovery contribution revenue. Drug discovery contribution revenue consists of funds received under an agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates\nFoundation on a cost reimbursement basis, to perform services aimed at accelerating drug discovery in women’s health. The initial agreement began in November 2021\nand expired in September 2023. In September 2023, the Company entered into a new agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to perform services aimed at\naccelerating drug discovery in women's health that expires in October 2025. Revenue is recognized as conditions are met in accordance with Topic 958. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had deferred revenue balances related to these agreements of $74 and $1,581, respectively.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the revenue recognized from the sources of drug discovery revenue:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDrug discovery services revenue from contracts with customers $ 2,813 $ 12,730 $ 17,012 $ 49,765\nDrug discovery contribution 593 935 1,507 2,306\nTotal drug discovery revenue $ 3,406 $ 13,665 $ 18,519 $ 52,071\n(c) Collaboration and License Agreement\nOn November 22, 2020, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n(\"BMS\"), pursuant to which the Company and BMS agreed to collaborate in the discovery, research and preclinical development of new small molecule compounds for\ndisease indications in oncology, neurology, and immunology therapeutics areas. Under the agreement, the Company was initially responsible, at its own cost and\nexpense, for the discovery of small molecule compounds directed to five specified biological targets pursuant to a mutually agreed research plan for each such target.\nThe initial targets included HIF-2 alpha and SOS1, which were two of the Company’s proprietary programs. In November 2021, the Company and BMS mutually\nagreed to replace the HIF-2 alpha target with another precision oncology target. Following the replacement election, all rights to the HIF-2 alpha target program reverted\nto the Company. In September 2022, BMS elected not to proceed with further development of another target and all rights to this program reverted to the Company,\nwhich increased revenue recognition in the third quarter of 2022 due to the accelerated completion of the Company's obligations related to the program. In December\n2022, the Company and BMS entered into an amendment to the agreement to include an additional target in neurology on terms similar to the original agreement. In\nSeptember 2023, BMS elected not to proceed with further development of two related oncology programs and all rights to these programs reverted to the Company,\nwhich increased revenue recognition in the third quarter of 2023 due to the accelerated completion of the Company's obligations related to those programs. In the first\nquarter of 2024, BMS elected not to proceed with further development of the SOS1 program based on portfolio prioritization decisions and all rights to this program\nreverted to the Company. In July 2024, BMS elected not to proceed with further development of an immunology target and all rights to this program reverted to the\nCompany. There is one remaining neurology target under the agreement, as amended.\nOnce a development candidate meeting specified criteria for a target under the agreement has been identified by the Company, BMS will be solely responsible\nfor the further development, manufacturing and commercialization of such development candidate at its own cost and expense. The Company is solely responsible for\nthe development of any programs that have been returned by BMS.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, as amended, BMS paid the Company an initial upfront fee payment of $55.0 million in November 2020 and an additional\nupfront payment in December 2022. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is eligible to receive up to $482.0 million in total milestone payments for the one\nremaining neurology target currently subject to the collaboration, consisting of up to $257.0 million in the aggregate for the achievement of certain specified research,\ndevelopment, and regulatory milestones and $225.0 million in the aggregate for the achievement of certain specified commercial milestones. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe Company has recognized $32.0 million in revenue related to milestones under this agreement.\nThe Company is also entitled to a tiered percentage royalty on annual net sales ranging from mid-single digits to low-double digits, subject to certain specified\nreductions. Royalties are payable by BMS on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last valid claim\ncovering the licensed product in such country, expiration of all applicable regulatory exclusivities in such country for such licensed product and the tenth anniversary of\nthe first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.\nThe Company assessed the collaboration and license agreement in accordance with Topic 606 and concluded that BMS is a customer based on the agreement\nstructure. At inception, the Company identified one performance obligation for each of the five programs initially covered under the agreement, which includes research\nactivities for each program and a license grant for the underlying intellectual property. The Company determined that the license grant for intellectual property is not\nseparable from the research activities, as the research activities are expected to significantly modify or enhance the license grant over the period of service, and therefore\nare not distinct in the context of the contract.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe Company determined that the transaction price at the onset of the agreement is $55.0 million. Additional consideration to be paid to the Company upon the\nachievement of future milestone payments were excluded from the transaction price as they represent milestone payments that are not considered probable as of the\ninception date such that there is not a significant risk of revenue reversal.\nThe Company has allocated the transaction price of $55.0 million to each performance obligation based on the SSP of each performance obligation at\ninception, which was determined based on each performance obligation’s estimated SSP. The Company determined the estimated SSP at contract inception of the\nresearch activities based on internal estimates of the costs to perform the services, inclusive of a reasonable profit margin. Significant inputs used to determine the total\ncosts to perform the research activities included the length of time required, the internal hours expected to be incurred on the services and the number and costs of\nvarious studies that will be performed to complete the research plan.\nRevenue associated with the research activities is recognized on a proportional performance basis over the period of service for research activities, using input-\nbased measurements of total costs of research incurred to estimate the proportion performed. Progress towards completion is remeasured at the end of each reporting\nperiod.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $1.1 million and $10.1 million, respectively, of revenue associated with\nthe agreement based on the research activities performed and milestones achieved. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company\nrecognized $11.2 million and $40.0 million, respectively, of revenue associated with the agreement based on the research activities performed and milestones achieved.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was $3.6 million and $7.3 million, respectively, of deferred revenue related to the agreement, which was\nclassified as either current or non-current in the condensed consolidated balance sheet based on the period the services are expected to be performed. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding receivables for this collaboration.\n(d) Significant Judgments\nSignificant judgments and estimates are required under Topic 606. Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required\nunder Topic 606 for the Company’s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.\nThe Company’s contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software products and services, including training, professional services,\ntechnical support services, and rights to unspecified updates. Determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted\nfor separately, or are not distinct and therefore should be accounted for together, requires significant judgment. In some arrangements, such as most of the Company’s\nterm-based software license arrangements, the Company has concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. In other arrangements,\nincluding collaboration services arrangements, the licenses and certain services may not be distinct from each other. The Company’s time-based software arrangements\nmay include multiple software licenses and a right to updates or upgrades to the licensed software products, and technical support. The Company has concluded that\nsuch promised goods and services are separate distinct performance obligations.\nThe Company is required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers, including any variable consideration. For\ncollaborative arrangements, under which the Company is eligible to receive variable consideration in the form of milestones payments, judgment is required to evaluate\nwhether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the constraint is removed and\nvalue of the associated milestone is included in the estimated transaction price using the most likely amount method based on contractual requirements and historical\nexperience. Once the estimated transaction price is established, amounts are allocated to the performance obligations that have been identified. The transaction price is\nallocated to each separate performance obligation on a relative SSP basis consistent with the allocation objectives of Topic 606.\n17\nTable of Contents\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company rarely licenses or sells products on a standalone basis, so the\nCompany is required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable because the Company does\nnot sell the license, product, or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that includes historical discounting practices, market conditions,\ncost-plus analysis, and other observable inputs. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those\nitems by volume of sales, classes of customers and other relevant circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use information such as the size and geographic\nregion of the customer in determining the SSP. Professional service revenue is recognized as costs and hours are incurred, and judgment is required in estimating both\nthe project status and the costs incurred or hours expended.\nIf a group of agreements are so closely related to each other that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one\narrangement for revenue recognition purposes. The Company exercises significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the\nseparate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. The Company’s judgments about whether a group of contracts\ncomprises a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for\nthe periods involved.\nJudgment is required to determine the total costs to perform research activities, which include the length of time required, the internal hours expected to be\nincurred on the services, and the number and costs of various studies that may be performed by third parties to complete the research plan.\nGenerally, the Company has not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers.\nThe Company’s estimates related to revenue recognition may require significant judgment and a change in these estimates could have an effect on the\nCompany’s results of operations during the periods involved.\n(e) Contract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in receivables, contract assets, or\ncontract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company records a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to\ninvoicing. A deferred revenue liability is recorded when revenue is expected to be recognized subsequent to invoicing. For the Company’s time-based software\nagreements, customers are generally invoiced at the beginning of the arrangement for the entire term, though when the term spans multiple years the customers may be\ninvoiced on an annual basis. For certain drug discovery agreements where the milestones are deemed probable in a period prior to when the milestone is achieved, the\nCompany records a contract asset for the full value of the milestone.\nContract assets are included in unbilled and other receivables within the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are transferred to receivables when the\nCompany invoices the customer.\nContract balances were as follows:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nContract assets $ 30,528 $ 21,107\nDeferred revenue, short-term:\nSoftware products and services 32,978 44,218\nDrug discovery 8,795 12,013\nDeferred revenue, long-term:\nSoftware products and services 1,862 2,407\nDrug discovery 3,338 6,636\n18\nTable of Contents\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $16,959, $45,199, $25,439, and $55,807 of revenue, respectively,\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the end of the respective preceding periods. All other deferred revenue activity is due to the timing of invoices in relation to the\ntiming of revenue, as described above. The Company expects to recognize as revenue approximately 89% of its September 30, 2024 deferred revenue balance in the\nnext 12 months and the remainder thereafter. Additionally, contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations that had not yet been billed to the customer or included in\ndeferred revenue were $39,956 as of September 30, 2024.\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms typically require payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue\nrecognition differs from that of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary\npurpose of invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing the Company’s products and services, not to facilitate financing\narrangements.\n(f) Deferred Sales Commissions\nThe Company has applied the practical expedient for sales commission expense, as any material compensation paid to sales representatives to obtain a contract\nrelates to a period of one year or less. The Company has not capitalized any costs related to sales commissions.\n(4) Fair Value Measurements\nVarious inputs are used in determining the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities. These inputs are summarized into the following three\nbroad categories:\nLevel 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical securities\nLevel 2 – other significant observable inputs, including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.\nLevel 3 – significant unobservable inputs, including the Company’s own assumptions in determining fair value\nThe inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. Marketable\nsecurities, which consist primarily of corporate and U.S. government agency bonds, are classified as available for sale and fair value did not differ significantly from\ncarrying value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following table presents information about the Company’s assets measured at fair value as of\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 170,176 $ — $ — $ 170,176\nMarketable securities — 228,263 — 228,263\nEquity investments 58,588 — — 58,588\nTotal $ 228,764 $ 228,263 $ — $ 457,027\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 161,066 $ — $ — $ 161,066\nMarketable securities — 307,688 — 307,688\nEquity investments 79,623 — — 79,623\nTotal $ 240,689 $ 307,688 $ — $ 548,377\nUnrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of the Company’s equity investments are classified within change in fair value in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. Realized gains arising from\n19\nTable of Contents\ndistributions receivable from the Company's equity investments are classified within gain on equity investments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nFor further information regarding the Company’s equity investments, see Note 10, Equity Investments.\n(5) Commitments and Contingencies\n(a) Leases\nThe Company has multiple operating leases for office space and a finance lease for equipment that expire at various dates through 2037. The Company has\nelected the package of practical expedients under the transition guidance of ASC Topic 842, Leases, to exclude short-term leases from the balance sheet and to combine\nlease and non-lease components. The Company classifies finance lease right of use assets under property and equipment, net and finance short-term and long-term lease\nliabilities under other accrued liabilities and other liabilities, long-term, respectively.\nUpon inception of a lease, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, if it is classified as an operating or finance lease, if it includes options to\nextend or terminate the lease, and if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the options. Lease cost, representing lease payments over the term of the\nlease and any capitalizable direct costs less any incentives received, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as lease expense.\nIn determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease\ncommencement date if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Upon execution of a new lease, the Company performs an analysis to determine its\nincremental borrowing rate using its current borrowing rate, adjusted for various factors including level of collateralization and lease term. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe remaining weighted average lease term for operating and finance leases was 11 years.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating lease right of use assets increased by $2,952 due to contingency resolutions associated with\noffice leases.\nVariable and short-term lease costs for the Company's operating and finance leases were immaterial for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additional\ndetails of the Company’s operating and finance leases are presented in the following table:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLease costs $ 4,527 $ 4,393 $ 13,586 $ 12,318\nCash paid for leases 5,048 3,229 13,521 8,789\nMaturities of operating and finance lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 under noncancelable leases were as follows:\nYear ending December 31:\nRemainder of 2024 $ 4,259\n2025 17,579\n2026 17,264\n2027 16,080\n2028 14,979\nThereafter 112,033\nTotal future minimum lease payments 182,194\nLess: imputed interest (61,824)\nPresent value of future minimum lease payments 120,370\nLess: current portion of lease payments 17,010\nLease liabilities, long-term $ 103,360\n20\nTable of Contents\n(b) Legal Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the results of such litigation\ncannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of such matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial\nposition or results of operations or cash flows.\n(6) Income Taxes\nThe Company estimates an annual effective income tax rate based on projected results for the year and applies this rate to income before taxes to calculate\nincome tax expense. Any refinements made due to subsequent information that affects the estimated annual effective income tax rate are reflected as adjustments in the\ncurrent period.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s income tax benefit was $90. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s\nincome tax expense was $449.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's income tax benefit was $2,887. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the\nCompany’s income tax expense was $3,041. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate\nwas primarily attributed to the application of research and development credits and the change in the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are \"more likely than not\" capable of being sustained. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company had $3,667 of unrecognized tax benefits. Interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as tax expense within the\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect a significant increase or decrease to the total amounts of unrecognized tax\nbenefits within the next twelve months.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns and various state, local and foreign income tax returns. At September 30, 2024, the\nCompany’s statutes of limitations are open for all federal and state tax returns filed after the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net operating loss\n(\"NOL\") and credit carryforwards from all years are subject to examination and adjustments for the three years following the year in which the carryforwards are\nutilized. The Company is not currently under Internal Revenue Service or state examination.\nPursuant to Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, the utilization of NOLs and other tax attributes may be substantially limited due to cumulative\nchanges in ownership greater than 50% that may have occurred or could occur during applicable testing periods. The Company has performed an analysis through\nDecember 31, 2023 and determined that such an ownership change occurred on March 31, 2021. There was no material impact to the financial statements due to this\nownership change.\n(7) Stockholders’ Equity\n(a) Common Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. Holders of common stock\nare entitled to one vote per share, to receive dividends, if and when declared by the board of directors, and upon liquidation or dissolution, to receive a portion of the\nassets available for distributions to stockholders, subject to preferential amounts owed to holders of the Company’s preferred stock, if any.\nCommon stockholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such shares. The\nrights, preferences and privileges of holders of the common stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by the right of the holders of shares of any series of\npreferred stock that the Company may designate and issue in the future.\n(b) Limited Common Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had authorized 100,000,000 shares of limited common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. Holders of limited\ncommon stock are entitled to one vote per share, however, the holders of limited common stock shall not be entitled to vote such shares in any election of directors or on\nthe removal of directors. Holders of limited common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by the board of directors, and\n21\nTable of Contents\nupon liquidation or dissolution, to receive a portion of the assets available for distributions to stockholders, subject to preferential amounts owed to holders of the\nCompany’s preferred stock, if any. Holders of the Company’s limited common stock have the right to convert each share of limited common stock into one share of the\nCompany’s common stock.\nLimited common stockholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such\nshares. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of the limited common stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by the right of the holders of shares of\nany series of preferred stock that the Company may designate and issue in the future.\n(c) Preferred Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had authorized 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. The Company’s\nboard of directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights,\nredemption privileges, and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock.\n(8) Stock-Based Compensation\nStock Incentive Plans\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s stock incentive plans included the 2010 Stock Plan (the \"2010 Plan\"), the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2020\nPlan\"), the 2021 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the \"2021 Plan\"), and the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the \"2022 Plan\") (together, the\n\"Plans\").\nThe 2022 Plan provides for the award of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock\nunits, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards to employees, directors, consultants or advisors. Shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards granted\nunder the 2020 Plan and the 2010 Plan that expire, terminate, or are otherwise surrendered, cancelled, forfeited, or repurchased by the Company are available for\nissuance under the 2022 Plan.\nThe 2021 Plan provides for the award of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock\nunits, and other stock-based awards to persons who were not previously an employee or director of the Company or who are commencing employment with the\nCompany following a bona fide period of non-employment, in either case, as an inducement material to such person’s entry into employment with the Company and in\naccordance with the requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5635(c)(4). Neither consultants nor advisors are eligible to participate in the 2021 Plan.\nThe 2020 Plan provided for the award of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock\nunits, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors, consultants or advisors. As of June 15, 2022, the effective date of the 2022 Plan, no further awards will be\nmade under the 2020 Plan. Any options or awards outstanding under the 2020 Plan are governed by the terms of the 2020 Plan.\nThe 2010 Plan provided for the granting of incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options to employees, directors, consultants or advisors. As of the\neffective date of the 2020 Plan, no further awards will be made under the 2010 Plan. Any options or awards outstanding under the 2010 Plan are governed by the terms\nof the 2010 Plan.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 6,360,189 and 3,472,195 shares available for grant under the Plans, respectively. The following\ntable presents classification of stock-based compensation expense within the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of sales $ 1,238 $ 1,234 $ 3,733 $ 3,922\nResearch and development 4,218 4,101 12,512 11,422\nSales and marketing 971 914 2,913 2,705\nGeneral and administrative 5,971 6,405 18,266 17,258\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 12,398 $ 12,654 $ 37,424 $ 35,307\n22\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Units\nEach restricted stock unit (“RSU”) represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock upon vesting. The fair value of RSUs granted by\nthe Company was calculated based upon the Company’s closing stock price on the date of the grant, and the stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the\nvesting period. RSUs generally vest over four years with 25% of the grants vesting at the end of the first year and the remaining vesting annually over the following\nthree years.\nThere were 28,195, 1,217,503, 33,285, and 748,265 RSUs granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nweighted average grant date fair value for each RSU granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $20.88, $24.92, $41.08, and\n$26.07, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $35,031 of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs granted under the Plans, which is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted average period of 3.12 years. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 7,910, 220,518, 1,166, and 13,241 RSUs vested,\nrespectively. The fair value of RSUs vested during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $177, $5,632, $62, and $355, respectively.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nIn March 2024 and February 2023, the Company awarded performance-based restricted stock units (\"PRSUs\") under the 2022 Plan. Each PRSU represents a\ncontingent right to receive one share of common stock upon the achievement of specified performance goals. The fair value of PRSUs granted by the Company was\ncalculated based upon the Company's closing stock price on the date of the grant, and the stock-based compensation expense is recognized when the grant date is\ndetermined and performance conditions are probable of achievement. At the point where performance conditions are considered probable of achievement, the Company\nrecords stock-based compensation expense with a cumulative catch-up expense in the period first recognized and on a straight-line basis over the remaining period for\nwhich the performance criteria are expected to be completed.\nIn March 2024, the Company awarded to all executive officers PRSUs for a maximum of 180,000 shares (based on 150% achievement of the applicable\nperformance conditions outlined in the awards), with a target award of 120,000 PRSUs (based on 100% achievement of the applicable performance conditions), and a\nthreshold award of 60,000 PRSUs (based on 50% achievement of the applicable performance conditions). All such PRSUs were considered granted under ASC 718,\nCompensation—Stock Compensation (\"Topic 718\") in March 2024. Such PRSUs are scheduled to vest, if at all, upon the certification by the Company's compensation\ncommittee of the achievement of the applicable performance conditions following the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2026.\nIn February 2023, the Company awarded to certain executive officers PRSUs for a maximum of 62,693 shares (based on 150% achievement of the applicable\nperformance conditions outlined in the awards), with a target award of 41,795 PRSUs (based on 100% achievement of the applicable performance conditions), and a\nthreshold award of 20,898 PRSUs (based on 50% achievement of the applicable performance conditions). All such PRSUs were considered granted under Topic 718 in\nFebruary 2023. Such PRSUs are scheduled to vest, if at all, upon the certification by the Company's compensation committee of the achievement of the applicable\nperformance conditions following the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.\nIn August 2022, the Company awarded 90,000 PRSUs to an executive officer of which 30,150 PRSUs were considered granted under Topic 718 at the time the\nPRSUs were awarded. In March 2024 and 2023, of the 90,000 PRSUs awarded in August 2022, an additional 14,850 and 45,000 PRSUs were considered granted under\nTopic 718, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company's compensation committee determined the achievement of the awards set to vest\nupon the certification by the Company's compensation committee following the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Of the 36,000 PRSUs that were eligible to vest, the Company's compensation committee determined that the applicable performance conditions had\nbeen met for 9,000 of the PRSUs, which vested during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and that the applicable performance conditions had not been met for\n27,000 PRSUs, which were forfeited during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The remaining 54,000 PRSUs are scheduled to vest, if at all, upon the certification\nby the Company's\n23\nTable of Contents\ncompensation committee of the achievement of the applicable performance conditions following the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyears ending December 31, 2024 and 2025.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value for each PRSU granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was zero, $26.08,\nzero, and $22.48, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, zero and 9,000 PRSUs vested, respectively. No PRSUs vested during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nStock Options\nStock options must be granted at an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair market value per share at the grant date. The board of directors or\ncompensation committee determines the exercise price of the Company’s stock options based on the closing price of the common stock as reported on the Nasdaq\nGlobal Select Market on the date of the grant. The maximum contractual term of options granted under the Plans is typically 10 years, options generally vest over four\nyears with 25% of the shares underlying the option vesting at the end of the first year and the remaining vesting monthly over the following three years. In March 2024\nand February 2023, the Company granted the chief executive officer premium priced options to purchase 87,271 and 65,525 shares of common stock, respectively, with\nexercise prices equal to 110% of the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 52,783, 151,939, 119,885, and 646,315 options under the Plans were exercised for total\nproceeds of $406, $1,354, $1,534, and $7,099, respectively.\nThe fair value of each option award is determined on the date of grant using the Black Scholes Merton option-pricing model. The calculation of fair value\nincluded several assumptions that require management’s judgment. The expected terms of options granted to employees during 2024 and 2023 were calculated using an\naverage of historical exercises. Estimated volatility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 incorporated a calculated volatility derived from the\nhistorical closing prices of shares of common stock of similar entities whose share prices were publicly available for the expected term of the option. The risk-free\ninterest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option. The Company accounts for forfeitures\nas they occur; as such, the Company does not estimate forfeitures at the time of grant.\nFollowing are the weighted average valuation assumptions used for option awards during the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nValuation assumptions\nExpected dividend yield — % — %\nExpected volatility 65 % 67 %\nExpected term (years) 5.31 4.98\nRisk-free interest rate 4.22 % 3.80 %\nThe weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $11.24,\n$14.90, $24.75, and $15.99, respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $676,\n$2,125, $2,835, and $14,140, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $49,625 of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted under the Plans, which is expected\nto be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.15 years. The fair value of shares vested during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nwas $8,125, $31,763, $9,991, and $37,858, respectively.\n24\nTable of Contents\n(9) Net (Loss) Income per Share Attributable to Common and Limited Common Stockholders\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to common and limited common stockholders for the\nperiods presented (in thousands, except for share and per share data):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet (loss) income attributable to Schrödinger common and limited common\nstockholders $ (38,136) $ (62,024) $ (146,907) $ 71,390\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares used to compute net (loss) income per share of common and\nlimited common stockholders, basic: 72,813,006 71,924,451 72,606,033 71,679,765\nEffect of the exercise of common stock options and vested RSUs on weighted average\ncommon and limited common shares — — — 3,287,026\nWeighted average shares used to compute net (loss) income per share of common and\nlimited common stockholders, diluted: 72,813,006 71,924,451 72,606,033 74,966,791\nNet (loss) income per share of common and limited common stockholders, basic: $ (0.52) $ (0.86) $ (2.02) $ 1.00\nNet (loss) income per share of common and limited common stockholders, diluted: $ (0.52) $ (0.86) $ (2.02) $ 0.95\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, in order to calculate diluted net income per share, the weighted average shares used to compute net\nincome is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under the Plans. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the resulting net income\nby the weighted average number of fully diluted common and limited shares outstanding.\nSince the Company was in a loss position for the three and nine ended September 30, 2024, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share as\nthe inclusion of all potential common shares and limited common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities that were not included\nin the diluted per share calculations because they would be anti-dilutive were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nShares subject to outstanding common stock options and unvested RSUs and PRSUs 13,663,287 12,243,352 13,663,287 6,192,747\n(10) Equity Investments\n(a) Nimbus\nThe Company previously provided collaboration services for Nimbus Therapeutics, LLC (\"Nimbus\") under the terms of a master services agreement executed\non May 18, 2010, as amended. Collaboration agreements are separate from the transaction that resulted in equity ownership and related fees are paid in cash to the\nCompany. Nimbus was previously recorded as an equity method investment under the hypothetical liquidated book value method, as the entity is a limited liability\ncompany and the Company was determined to have significant influence due to the Company's collaboration with Nimbus on a number of drug discovery targets, as\nwell as the Company's level of ownership in Nimbus. During the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company's equity ownership in Nimbus was diluted to the point\nthat the Company no longer has significant influence over the entity. As the Company no longer has significant influence over Nimbus, after June 30, 2023, the equity\ninvestment in Nimbus is valued as a non-marketable equity security.\nThe carrying value of the Nimbus investment was $1,928 as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has no obligation to fund\nNimbus' losses in excess of its initial investment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported no gain or loss on the Nimbus\ninvestment. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported an unrealized gain of $2,165 on the Nimbus investment due to the change in\naccounting method. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a realized gain of $147,322 on\n25\nTable of Contents\nthe Nimbus investment, which reflected the total cash distribution the Company was eligible to receive from Nimbus on account of Takeda's acquisition of Nimbus\nLakshmi, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nimbus, and its tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor NDI-034858, as well as an unrealized gain of $2,165 on the Nimbus investment\ndue to the change in accounting method.\n(b) Morphic\nOn August 15, 2024, the Company disposed of its equity stake in Morphic Holding, Inc. (\"Morphic\") for aggregate consideration of $47,588 in connection with\nEli Lilly and Company's acquisition of Morphic. Prior to the disposition of the Morphic investment, the Company accounted for its investment in Morphic at fair value\nbased on the share price of Morphic’s common stock at the measurement date.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a mark-to-market gain of $19,140 and $23,474, respectively, on the\nMorphic investment. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a mark-to-market loss of $28,740 and $3,206, respectively, on\nthe Morphic investment.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Morphic was zero and $24,114, respectively.\n(c) Ajax\nIn May 2021, the Company purchased 631,377 shares of Series B preferred stock of Ajax Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Ajax\") for $1,700 in cash. In April 2024, the\nCompany purchased 1,416,450 shares of Series C preferred stock of Ajax for $3,000 in cash. The Company has concluded that its equity investment in Ajax should be\nvalued as a non-marketable equity security as the Company does not exercise significant influence over Ajax.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Ajax was $4,700 and $1,700, respectively.\n(d) Structure Therapeutics\nIn July 2021, the Company purchased 494,035 shares of Series B preferred stock of Structure Therapeutics for $2,000 in cash. In April 2022, the Company\npurchased an additional 148,210 shares of Series B preferred stock for $600 in cash. On February 7, 2023, Structure Therapeutics completed its initial public offering\n(\"IPO\"). Immediately upon the closing of Structure Therapeutics' IPO, all of the outstanding Series B preferred stock automatically converted into ordinary shares on a\none-for-one basis. The Company purchased 275,000 American Depository Shares (\"ADSs\") at $15.00 per ADS in the IPO. Each ADS represents three ordinary shares.\nThe Company accounts for its investment in Structure Therapeutics at fair value based on the closing price of Structure Therapeutics' ADSs as of the reporting date.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a mark-to-market gain of $6,318 and $4,289, respectively, on the Structure\nTherapeutics investment. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a mark-to-market gain of $12,052 and $62,910,\nrespectively, on the Structure Therapeutics investment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company's investment in Structure\nTherapeutics was $58,588 and $55,509, respectively.\n(11) Related Party Transactions\n(a) Board Member\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid consulting fees of $109, $319, $105, and $315, respectively, to a\nmember of its board of directors.\n(b) Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, an entity under common control with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, a stockholder of the Company, issued a\ngrant under which it agreed to pay the Company directly for certain licenses and services provided to a specified group of third-party organizations. Revenue recognized\nfor services provided by the Company under this grant was $21, $91, $63, and $183 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n26\nTable of Contents\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $593, $1,507, $935, and $2,306, respectively, in drug discovery\ncontribution revenue related to funds received under an agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed at accelerating drug discovery in women’s health.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, restricted cash on hand related to the arrangement was $139 and $2,251, respectively.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $1,124 in software contribution revenue related to funds received under an\nagreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to fund the initiative to accelerate the expansion of the Company's computational platform to predict toxicity\nassociated with binding to off-target proteins. As of September 30, 2024, restricted cash on hand related to the arrangement was $3,917.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had no receivables due from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation related to any of these agreements.\nGates Ventures, LLC is an entity under the control of William H. Gates III, who may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company’s\nvoting securities. The Company received $1,000 in contribution revenue in connection with its entry into an agreement with Gates Ventures, LLC annually from June\n2020 to June 2022. In August 2023, the Company renewed the agreement with Gates Ventures, LLC and recognized $1,800 in contribution revenue upon extension of\nthe agreement and $2,000 in contribution revenue upon the first anniversary of the extension. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no\nnet receivables due from Gates Ventures, LLC.\n(12) Segment Reporting\nThe Company has determined that its chief executive officer (\"CEO\") is its chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). The Company’s CEO evaluates the\nfinancial performance of the Company based on two reportable segments: Software and Drug Discovery. The Software segment is focused on licensing the Company’s\nsoftware to transform molecular discovery. The Drug Discovery segment is focused on building a portfolio of preclinical and clinical drug programs, internally and\nthrough collaborations.\nThe CODM reviews segment performance and allocates resources based upon segment revenue and segment gross profit of the Software and Drug Discovery\nreportable segments. Segment gross profit is derived by deducting operational expenditures, with the exception of research and development, sales and marketing, and\ngeneral and administrative activities from U.S. GAAP revenue. Operational expenditures are expenditures made that are directly attributable to the reportable segment.\nThese expenditures are allocated to the segments based on headcount. The reportable segment expenditures include compensation, supplies, and services from contract\nresearch organizations.\nCertain cost items are not allocated to the Company’s reportable segments. These cost items primarily consist of non-drug discovery program related\ncompensation and general operational expenses associated with the Company’s research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. These\ncosts are incurred by both segments and due to the integrated nature of the Company’s Software and Drug Discovery segments, any allocation methodology would be\narbitrary and provide no meaningful analysis.\nSegment revenue is primarily earned in the United States and there are no intersegment revenues. Additionally, the Company reports assets on a consolidated\nbasis and does not allocate assets to its reportable segments for purposes of assessing segment performance or allocating resources.\n27\nTable of Contents\nPresented below is financial information with respect to the Company’s reportable segments for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSegment revenues:\nSoftware $ 31,884 $ 28,904 $ 100,703 $ 90,469\nDrug discovery 3,406 13,665 18,519 52,071\nTotal segment revenues $ 35,290 $ 42,569 $ 119,222 $ 142,540\nSegment gross profit:\nSoftware $ 23,405 $ 21,870 $ 77,081 $ 69,625\nDrug discovery (5,677) 1,769 (9,128) 13,517\nTotal segment gross profit 17,728 23,639 67,953 83,142\nUnallocated:\nResearch and development (50,977) (46,833) (152,423) (130,279)\nSales and marketing (10,349) (9,109) (30,213) (27,276)\nGeneral and administrative (24,824) (23,890) (73,901) (73,414)\nGain on equity investments — — — 147,322\nChange in fair value 25,459 (14,522) 27,763 61,869\nOther income 4,737 5,804 14,363 13,067\nIncome tax benefit (expense) 90 2,887 (449) (3,041)\nConsolidated net (loss) income $ (38,136) $ (62,024) $ (146,907) $ 71,390\nRevenues by geographic area are determined based on the address provided by the Company's customers and partners.

The agreement is intended to advance multiple development candidates for development\nand commercialization by Novartis. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis agreed to pay to the Company an initial upfront fee of $150.0 million following\nexpiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period, and the Company will be eligible to receive up to $2.272 billion in total milestones across the initial programs.\nSuch milestones consist of up to $892.0 million in discovery and development milestones and up to $1.38 billion in commercial milestones. The Company is also\nentitled to a tiered percentage royalty ranging from mid single-digits to low double-digits on products commercialized by Novartis under the agreement, subject to\ncertain specified reductions. The Company also entered into an expanded three-year software agreement with Novartis that substantially increases Novartis' access to the\nCompany’s computational predictive modeling technology and enterprise informatics platform.\n28\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in\nthis Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report, our actual\nresults could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. For further\ninformation regarding our forward-looking statements, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Quarterly Report.\nOverview\nWe are transforming the way therapeutics and materials are discovered. Our differentiated, physics-based computational platform enables discovery of high-\nquality, novel molecules for drug development and materials applications more rapidly and at a lower cost, compared to traditional methods. Our software platform is\nlicensed by biopharmaceutical and industrial companies, academic institutions, and government laboratories around the world. We are applying our computational\nplatform to advance a broad pipeline of drug discovery programs in collaboration with leading biopharmaceutical companies. In addition, we use our computational\nplatform to discover novel molecules for our pipeline of proprietary drug discovery programs, which we are advancing through preclinical and clinical development.\nSince our founding, we have been primarily focused on developing our computational platform, which is capable of predicting critical properties of molecules\nwith a high degree of accuracy, as well as advancing drug discovery programs both with our collaborators and on our own. We have devoted substantially all of our\nresources to introducing new capabilities and refining our software, conducting research and development activities, recruiting skilled personnel, and providing general\nand administrative support for these operations.\nOver the last decade, we have entered into a number of collaborations with leading biopharmaceutical companies that have provided us with significant\nrevenue and have the potential to produce additional milestone payments, option fees, and future royalties. In 2018, we began to develop a pipeline of proprietary drug\ndiscovery programs with the goal of using our platform to produce a portfolio of novel, high value therapeutics. In June 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,\nor FDA, cleared our first investigational new drug application, or IND, for our MALT1 inhibitor, which we refer to as SGR-1505. We have initiated dosing in a Phase 1\nclinical trial of SGR-1505, which is designed as an open-label, multi-center dose escalation trial in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas. The trial is\ndesigned to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose of SGR-1505. Exploratory cohorts will\nevaluate additional pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, preliminary anti-tumor activity and safety to establish the recommended dose. We anticipate reporting initial\ndata from the trial in the first half of 2025.\nWe also completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of SGR-1505 in 73 healthy volunteers to gather additional data, including data relating to the safety, tolerability and\npharmacokinetics of SGR-1505, as well as the effect of food and drug-drug interactions. In the healthy volunteer trial, SGR-1505 was generally well tolerated with no\ndrug-related serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities observed. In the trial, we observed that SGR-1505 achieved greater than 90 percent inhibition of IL-2\nsecretion in an activated T cell whole blood assay at 100mg twice a day (n=4), confirming target engagement and meeting the pharmacodynamic goals for the trial.\nInhibition of IL-2 secretion is a marker for target engagement and pathway modulation as it is tightly linked to MALT1 and the downstream NF-κB signaling. The data\nsupported continued evaluation of SGR-1505 in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas. In addition, the FDA\nrecently granted orphan drug designation to SGR-1505 for the potential treatment of mantle cell lymphoma.\nIn July 2023, the FDA cleared our IND for our CDC7 inhibitor, which we refer to as SGR-2921. In July 2024, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to SGR-\n2921 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. We have initiated dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of SGR-2921, which is designed as an open-\nlabel, multi-center dose-escalation clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. The trial is\ndesigned to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SGR-2921 as a monotherapy and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose, including the maximum tolerated dose.\nSecondary and exploratory objectives of the trial include evaluating\n29\nTable of Contents\nthe pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SGR-2921 and investigating preliminary anti-tumor activity. We anticipate reporting initial data from the trial in the\nsecond half of 2025.\nIn March 2024, we also submitted an IND to the FDA for our novel WEE1/MYT1 inhibitor, which we refer to as SGR-3515, and the FDA cleared the IND in\nApril 2024. We recently initiated dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of SGR-3515 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial is a dose-escalation trial designed to\nevaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, preliminary anti-tumor activity and recommended Phase 2 dose of SGR-3515, and we anticipate reporting\ninitial data from the trial in the second half of 2025.\nIn July 2024, we launched an initiative to expand our computational platform to predict toxicity associated with binding to off-target proteins. The goal of this\ninitiative is to develop a computational solution to improve the properties of drug development candidates and reduce the risk of development failure. The project will\nbe funded initially by a $10 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\nWe have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of our equity securities, including our initial public offering and our follow-on public offering,\nand to a lesser extent, from sales of our software solutions and from upfront payments, research funding and milestone payments from our drug discovery\ncollaborations, and from distributions on account of, or proceeds from the sale of, our equity stakes in our collaborators. On February 13, 2023, April 6, 2023, and\nNovember 9, 2023, on account of our equity stake in Nimbus Therapeutics, LLC, or Nimbus, we received cash distributions of $111.3 million, $35.8 million, and $0.1\nmillion, respectively, from Nimbus in connection with Takeda’s acquisition of Nimbus Lakshmi, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nimbus, and its TYK2 inhibitor\nNDI-034858.\nOn August 15, 2024, Morphic Holding, Inc., or Morphic, one of our drug discovery collaborators and co-founded companies, was acquired by Eli Lilly and\nCompany, or Lilly, for $57.00 per share, or approximately $3.2 billion. In connection with the acquisition, we received $47.6 million for the 834,968 shares of Morphic\nwe owned. We are also entitled to low single-digit royalties on our clinical development programs under our collaboration agreement with Morphic, including MORF-\n057.\nWe currently conduct our operations through two reportable segments: software and drug discovery. The software segment is focused on selling our software to\ntransform drug discovery across the life sciences industry, as well as to customers in materials science industries. The drug discovery segment is focused on generating\nrevenue from a diverse portfolio of preclinical and clinical programs, internally and through collaborations, that have advanced to various stages of discovery and\ndevelopment.\nOur software segment generates revenue from software product licenses, hosted software subscriptions, software maintenance, professional services, and\ncontributions. The revenue we generate through our software solutions from each of our customers varies largely depending on the type and number of software licenses\nour customers purchase from us. The licenses that our customers purchase from us provide them the ability to perform a certain number of calculations used in the\ndesign of molecules for drug discovery or materials science. The amount we charge per license depends on the specific software products our customers purchase from\nus, and the number of licenses needed to perform calculations per software product varies. With the exception of certain limited products, the number of licenses a\ncustomer requires is typically based on the scale at which they are running our software products and is not based on how many users have access to the software. As\ncustomers increase the number of licenses they purchase from us, they will typically be able to run a greater number of simultaneous instances of our products, thereby\nincreasing the number of calculations they will be able to perform in parallel, subject to having enough computational capacity. We deliver our software through either\n(i) a product license that permits our customers to install the software solution directly on their own in-house hardware and use it for a specified term, or (ii) a\nsubscription that allows our customers to access our cloud-based software solution on their own hardware without taking control of licenses.\nWe currently generate drug discovery revenue from our collaborations, including as a result of upfront payments, conducting research and development\nactivities and upon achievement of discovery and development milestones. In the future, we may also derive drug discovery revenue from our collaborations from\noption fees, the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones, and royalties on commercial drug sales. In addition to revenue from our collaborations, we may\nalso derive drug discovery revenue from collaborating on or out-licensing our proprietary drug discovery programs when we believe it will help maximize the clinical\nand commercial opportunities for the program.\nWe are party to an exclusive, worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS\nagreed to collaborate in the discovery, research and development of\n30\nTable of Contents\nsmall molecule compounds for biological targets in the oncology, neurology and immunology therapeutic areas. After mutual agreement on the targets(s) of interest, the\nSchrödinger therapeutics group is responsible for the discovery of development candidates. Once a development candidate meeting specified criteria for a target has\nbeen identified, BMS will be solely responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of such development candidate. We are eligible to receive\nup to $482.0 million in total milestone payments for the one remaining neurology target currently subject to the collaboration, as well as a tiered percentage royalty on\nnet sales of each product commercialized by BMS ranging from mid-single digits to low-double digits, subject to certain specified reductions. We have recognized a\ntotal of $32.0 million in milestone payments from BMS as of September 30, 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, BMS elected not to proceed with further development of\nthe SOS1 program based on portfolio prioritization decisions and all rights to this program reverted to us. Given the potential of SOS1 inhibition to be used in\ncombination with KRAS and other inhibitors, our current plan is to seek to advance this program through a collaboration. In July 2024, BMS elected not to proceed with\nfurther development of an immunology target and all rights to this program reverted to the Company. Based on the project viability and competitive positioning of the\ninitial target product profile, we do not intend to further advance this program. See \"Collaboration and License Agreement\" in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for additional information relating to this agreement.\nIn September 2022, we entered into a collaboration with Lilly under which we are responsible for the discovery and optimization of small molecule compounds\naddressing an immunology target. Lilly will be responsible for the completion of preclinical development, clinical development and commercialization. Under the terms\nof the agreement, we received an upfront payment and we are eligible to receive up to $425.0 million in discovery, development and commercial milestone payments.\nWe are also eligible to receive low single- to low double-digit royalties on net sales of any products emerging from the collaboration in all markets.\nOn November 11, 2024, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, pursuant to which, following\nexpiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period, we and Novartis will collaborate on the discovery, research and pre-clinical development of small molecule\ncompounds for targets in certain specified therapeutic areas. The agreement is intended to advance multiple development candidates for development and\ncommercialization by Novartis. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis has agreed to pay us an initial upfront fee of $150.0 million following expiration of the\nHart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period, and we will be eligible to receive up to $2.272 billion in total milestones across the initial programs. Such milestones consist of\nup to $892.0 million in discovery and development milestones and up to $1.38 billion in commercial milestones. We are also entitled to a tiered percentage royalty\nranging from mid single-digits to low double-digits on products commercialized by Novartis under the agreement, subject to certain specified reductions. We also\nentered into an expanded three-year software agreement with Novartis that substantially increases Novartis' access to our computational predictive modeling technology\nand enterprise informatics platform.\nWe generated revenue of $35.3 million and $42.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a year-over-\nyear decrease of 17%. Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $38.1 million and $62.0 million, respectively.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nSoftware Products and Services Revenue\nOur software business generates revenue from five sources: (i) on-premise software license fees, (ii) hosted software subscription fees, (iii) software\nmaintenance fees, (iv) professional services fees, and (v) contributions.\nOn-premise software. Our on-premise software license arrangements grant customers the right to use our software on their own in-house servers or their own\ncloud instances for a specified term, typically for one year, though in recent years, we have entered into a small number of large multi-year on-premise software license\nagreements. We recognize revenue for on-premise software license fees upfront, either upon transfer of control of the license or the effective date of the agreement,\nwhichever is later.\nHosted software. Hosted software revenue consists primarily of fees to provide our customers with hosted licenses, which allows these customers to access our\ncloud-based software solution on their own hardware without taking control of the licenses, and is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, which is\ntypically one year, though in recent years, we have entered into a small number of large multi-year hosted software license agreements. When a customer enters into a\nhosted arrangement for which revenue is recognized over time, the amount paid upfront that is not recognized in the current period is included in deferred revenue in our\nstatement of financial position until the period in which it is recognized.\n31\nTable of Contents\nSoftware maintenance. Software maintenance includes technical support, updates, and upgrades related to our on-premise software licenses. Software\nmaintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Software maintenance activities are performed in connection with the use of our on-\npremise software, and may fluctuate from period to period.\nProfessional services. Professional services include training, technical setup, installation or assisting customers with modeling services, where we use our\nsoftware to perform tasks such as virtual screening on behalf of our customers. These services are generally not related to the core functionality of our software and are\nrecognized as revenue when resources are consumed. Since each professional services agreement represents a unique, ad hoc engagement, professional services revenue\nmay fluctuate from period to period.\nSoftware contribution revenue. Software contribution revenue consists of funds received under non-reciprocal agreements with Gates Ventures, LLC and the\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The agreement with Gates Ventures, LLC was originally entered into in June 2020 and further extended through August 2026. The\nagreement is an unconditional non-exchange contribution without restrictions. Revenue was recognized annually from June 2020 through June 2022 and upon extension\nof the agreement in August 2023, when invoiced, in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 958, Not-for-Profit Entities, or Topic 958, as the\nagreement is not an exchange transaction.\nWe entered into a one-year agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in July 2024 to initially fund our initiative to accelerate the expansion of our\ncomputational platform to predict toxicity associated with binding to off-target proteins. Revenue is recognized as conditions are met and on a cost reimbursement basis\nin accordance with Topic 958.\nDrug Discovery Revenue\nDrug discovery services. We currently generate drug discovery revenue from discovery collaboration arrangements, including as a result of upfront payments,\nconducting research and development activities and upon achievement of discovery and development milestones. The majority of our current collaborations are in the\ndiscovery and preclinical development stages. Milestone payments typically increase in magnitude as a program advances. However, our focus is increasingly on\ninvesting in our proprietary drug discovery programs, which may result in a smaller number of collaborative programs over time and, as a result, fewer milestone\npayments on account of those collaborative programs. In addition to revenue from our collaborations, we may also derive drug discovery revenue from out-licensing our\nproprietary drug discovery programs when we believe it will help maximize the probability of clinical and commercial success of the program. Overall, we expect that\nour drug discovery revenue will fluctuate from period to period due to the inherently uncertain nature of the timing of milestone achievements and our dependence on\nthe program decisions of our collaborators.\nDrug discovery contribution revenue. Contribution revenue consists of funds received under agreements with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on a cost\nreimbursement basis, to perform services aimed at accelerating drug discovery in women’s health. Revenue is recognized as conditions are met in accordance with Topic\n958.\nCost of Revenues\nSoftware products and services. Cost of revenues for software includes personnel-related expenses (comprised of salaries, benefits, and stock-based\ncompensation) for employees directly involved in the delivery of software solutions, maintenance and professional services, royalties paid for products sold and services\nperformed using third-party licensed software functionality, and allocated overhead (facilities and information technology support) costs. Pursuant to various third-party\narrangements, we license technology that is used in our software. These arrangements require us to pay royalties based on sales volume.\nDrug discovery. Costs of revenue for drug discovery includes personnel-related expenses and costs of third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, that\nsupport discovery activities in our collaborations, royalties paid for services performed using third-party licensed software functionality, allocated compute capacity and\noverhead costs. While we have incurred costs associated with discovery efforts since late 2017, we have recognized and expect to continue to recognize revenues in the\nfuture if and when milestones are deemed probable or achieved. Generally, drug discovery costs of revenue for collaborations are incurred in advance of the revenue\nmilestone achievement.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe expect our drug discovery costs of revenue to trend lower over time as we shift our focus to proprietary drug discovery programs. However, these trends\nwill be impacted by the number and stage of our collaborative programs, especially in the case of new collaborative programs.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit represents revenue less cost of revenues. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our software products and services\ngross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates, and as a result of changes in sales mix between on-premise and hosted software solutions\ndue to timing of recognition. For example, the cost of royalties due for sales of our hosted software arrangements are recognized upfront, whereas the associated hosted\nsoftware revenue for these arrangements is recognized over the term of the underlying agreement.\nWhile the gross margin of our drug discovery business will fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on factors such as the timing of recognition\nof milestones, the number and mix of collaborative programs and their respective stages of development, we expect the gross margins to generally trend higher over\ntime as more programs advance to later stages of development, the milestones increase in size and our ongoing research and development obligations to such programs\ndecline in cost.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense accounts for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We recognize research and development expense as incurred.\nResearch and development expense consists of drug discovery and development program costs and costs incurred for continuous development of the technology and\nscience that supports our computational platform, primarily:\n• personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in research and development\nfunctions;\n• expenses incurred under agreements with third-party CROs and consultants involved in our proprietary drug discovery programs; and\n• allocated compute capacity on our proprietary drug discovery programs and overhead (facilities and information technology support) costs.\nWe expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in activities related to discovery and development of\nour proprietary drug discovery programs, in advancing our computational platform, and as we incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel directly\ninvolved in such efforts. The amount to which our research and development expense may increase in the future will also be dependent on our development plans for\nour proprietary drug discovery programs, including the timing of any partnering or out-licensing decisions. At this time, we do not know, nor can we reasonably\nestimate, the nature, timing, or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any of our proprietary drug discovery programs.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs for our sales and marketing staff and application scientists supporting our sales\nefforts, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Other sales and marketing costs include promotional events that promote and expand\nknowledge of our company and platform, including industry conferences and events and our annual user group meetings in the United States and Europe, advertising,\nand allocated overhead costs. Due to the inherent scientific complexity of our software solutions, a high level of scientific expertise is needed to support our sales and\nmarketing efforts. We plan to make focused investments in sales and marketing over the foreseeable future to foster the growth of our business as we aim to expand\nsoftware sales to existing customers and increase our customer base.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists of personnel-related expenses associated with our executive, legal, finance, human resources, information\ntechnology, and other administrative functions, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. General and administrative expense also includes\nprofessional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, allocated overhead costs, and other general operating expenses.\n33\nTable of Contents\nWe expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations\napplicable to companies listed on a U.S. securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In addition, as a public company, we expect to continue to incur increased expenses such as insurance and professional\nservices. As a result, we expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expense to increase for the foreseeable future.\nGain on Equity Investments\nGain on equity investments consists of realized gains in the form of cash distributions from our equity investments.\nChange in Fair Value\nFair value gains and losses consist of adjustments to the fair value of our equity investments, which may include Nimbus, Structure Therapeutics Inc., or\nStructure Therapeutics, and Morphic. We remeasure our investments at each period end.\nWe expect that fair value gains and losses will fluctuate significantly in future periods.\nOther Income\nOther income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense, and transactional foreign exchange gains and\nlosses.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax (benefit) expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We\nmaintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be\nrealized.\n34\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our unaudited results of operations data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nRevenues:\nSoftware products and services $ 31,884 $ 28,904 $ 2,980 10% $ 100,703 $ 90,469 $ 10,234 11%\nDrug discovery 3,406 13,665 (10,259) (75)% 18,519 52,071 (33,552) (64)%\nTotal revenues 35,290 42,569 (7,279) (17)% 119,222 142,540 (23,318) (16)%\nCost of revenues:\nSoftware products and services 8,479 7,034 1,445 21% 23,622 20,844 2,778 13%\nDrug discovery 9,083 11,896 (2,813) (24)% 27,647 38,554 (10,907) (28)%\nTotal cost of revenues 17,562 18,930 (1,368) (7)% 51,269 59,398 (8,129) (14)%\nGross profit 17,728 23,639 (5,911) (25)% 67,953 83,142 (15,189) (18)%\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 50,977 46,833 4,144 9% 152,423 130,279 22,144 17%\nSales and marketing 10,349 9,109 1,240 14% 30,213 27,276 2,937 11%\nGeneral and administrative 24,824 23,890 934 4% 73,901 73,414 487 1%\nTotal operating expenses 86,150 79,832 6,318 8% 256,537 230,969 25,568 11%\nLoss from operations (68,422) (56,193) (12,229) 22% (188,584) (147,827) (40,757) 28%\nOther income (expense)\nGain on equity investments — — — N/M — 147,322 (147,322) N/M\nChange in fair value 25,459 (14,522) 39,981 N/M 27,763 61,869 (34,106) N/M\nOther income 4,737 5,804 (1,067) N/M 14,363 13,067 1,296 N/M\nTotal other income (expense) 30,196 (8,718) 38,914 N/M 42,126 222,258 (180,132) N/M\n(Loss) income before income taxes (38,226) (64,911) 26,685 N/M (146,458) 74,431 (220,889) N/M\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (90) (2,887) 2,797 N/M 449 3,041 (2,592) N/M\nNet (loss) income $ (38,136) $ (62,024) $ 23,888 N/M $ (146,907) $ 71,390 $ (218,297) N/M\nN/M – not meaningful\n35\nTable of Contents\nRevenues\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nRevenues:\nSoftware\nOn-premise software $ 12,250 $ 13,806 $ (1,556) (11)% $ 48,627 $ 50,564 $ (1,937) (4)%\nHosted software 8,814 5,463 3,351 61% 24,077 14,366 9,711 68%\nSoftware maintenance 5,658 5,752 (94) (2)% 17,393 17,378 15 —%\nProfessional services 2,038 2,083 (45) (2)% 7,482 6,361 1,121 18%\nRevenue from contracts with\ncustomers 28,760 27,104 1,656 6% 97,579 88,669 8,910 10%\nSoftware contribution 3,124 1,800 1,324 74% 3,124 1,800 1,324 74%\nTotal software products and\nservices 31,884 28,904 2,980 10% 100,703 90,469 10,234 11%\nDrug discovery\nDrug discovery services 2,813 12,730 (9,917) (78)% 17,012 49,765 (32,753) (66)%\nDrug discovery contribution 593 935 (342) (37)% 1,507 2,306 (799) (35)%\nTotal drug discovery 3,406 13,665 (10,259) (75)% 18,519 52,071 (33,552) (64)%\nTotal revenues $ 35,290 $ 42,569 $ (7,279) (17)% $ 119,222 $ 142,540 $ (23,318) (16)%\nSoftware Products and Services Revenue\nOn-premise software. The decrease in revenues for on-premise software for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in multi-year customer contracts with upfront revenue recognition in the current period\nversus the comparable period.\nHosted software. The increase in revenues for hosted software for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increased spend from existing customers, as well as growth in new customers purchasing hosted software\nsubscriptions, for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.\nSoftware maintenance. The decrease in revenues for software maintenance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to fluctuations in the length of renewal periods. The increase in revenues for software maintenance for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the fluctuation of on-premise software renewal periods,\nincluding multi-year customer arrangements, in the current period versus the comparable period, as well as increased spend from existing customers. Software\nmaintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.\nProfessional services. The decrease in revenues from professional services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to fluctuations in the timing of progress and completion of technology and modeling service projects. The increase in\nrevenues from professional services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to\nthe progress and completion of technology and modeling service projects.\nSoftware contribution revenue. The increase in revenues from software contribution during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared\nto the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation entered into in July 2024, and the\nconsideration received for the extension of the agreement with Gates Ventures, LLC.\n36\nTable of Contents\nDrug Discovery Revenue\nDrug discovery services. The decrease in revenues for drug discovery services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to BMS electing not to proceed with further development for two programs during 2023, which resulted in increased\nrevenue recognition due to the accelerated completion of our obligations related to such programs during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is\noffset by an increase in revenue due to the progress of existing and new collaborations.\nThe decrease in revenues for drug discovery services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 was primarily due to the timing and amount of collaboration milestones achieved, including $25.0 million recognized from BMS in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, as well as BMS electing not to proceed with further development for two programs during 2023. The decrease is offset by an increase in revenue\nfrom collaboration milestones achieved in 2024, as well as the progress of existing and new collaborations. We expect that our drug discovery revenue will fluctuate\nfrom period to period due to the inherently uncertain nature of the timing of milestone achievements and our dependence on the program decisions of our collaborators.\nDrug discovery contribution revenue. The decrease in contribution revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to fluctuation in allotted funds spent under an agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed at\naccelerating drug discovery in women’s health, which began in November 2021.\nCost of Revenues\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nCost of revenues:\nSoftware products and services $ 8,479 $ 7,034 $ 1,445 21% $ 23,622 $ 20,844 $ 2,778 13%\nGross margin 73 % 76 % 77 % 77 %\nDrug discovery 9,083 11,896 (2,813) (24)% 27,647 38,554 (10,907) (28)%\nSoftware products and services.

Our income\ntax expense primarily represents our income tax obligations in certain states and taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, our income tax benefit represented a reduction of our federal and state tax liability due to a decrease in our\nestimated annual effective income tax rate driven by loss before income tax.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our income tax expense primarily represented the federal and state tax liability, which was driven by our\ncash distributions received from Nimbus and the impact of capitalizing research and development costs for tax purposes. We have sufficient deferred tax assets which\nwe plan to utilize to offset the majority of the cash impact of these taxes.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nDetailed information about our critical accounting estimates is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. There were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Funding Requirements\nWe have a history of significant operating losses and have incurred negative cash flows from operations from inception through the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $485.3 million.\nWe have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of our equity securities, including our initial public offering and our follow-on public offering,\nand to a lesser extent, from sales of our software solutions and from upfront payments, research funding and milestone payments from our drug discovery\ncollaborations, and from distributions on account of, or proceeds from the sale of, our equity stakes in our collaborators. Our operating cash flows are impacted by the\nmagnitude and timing of our software sales and by the magnitude and timing of our drug discovery milestone achievements and research funding fees.\nOn February 28, 2024, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which allows us to offer and sell an indeterminate number of shares of\ncommon stock, preferred stock, depositary shares or warrants, or an indeterminate principal amount of debt securities, from time to time pursuant to one or more\nofferings at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the sale.\nIn February 2024, we entered into an amended and restated sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (formerly SVB Securities LLC), or Leerink Partners, as\nsales agent, with respect to an at-the-market offering program, or the ATM, under which we could offer and sell, from time to time pursuant to our Registration\nStatement on Form S-3, shares of common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million through Leerink Partners. The amended and restated sales\nagreement amends and restates the original sales agreement that we entered into with Leerink Partners with respect to the ATM in May 2023, which is no longer in\neffect. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, zero and 323,085 shares of common stock, respectively, were sold under the ATM for total net\nproceeds of zero and $8.7 million, respectively, and gross proceeds of zero and $8.9 million, respectively, before deducting sales agent\n41\nTable of Contents\ncommissions. As of September 30, 2024, we had $241.1 million of common stock remaining available for sale under the ATM.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities of $398.4 million.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital\nexpenditure requirements through at least the next 24 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the growth of our software\nrevenue, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the continued expansion of software sales and marketing activities, the timing\nand receipt of milestone payments from our collaborations, as well as spending to support, advance, and broaden our proprietary drug discovery programs. Furthermore,\nour capital requirements will also change depending on the timing and receipt of any distributions we may receive from our equity stakes in our drug discovery\ncollaborators. The potential for these distributions, and the amounts which we may be entitled to receive, are difficult to predict due to the inherent uncertainty of the\nevents which may trigger such distributions.\nWe plan to utilize the existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand primarily to fund our software and drug discovery activities. With\nrespect to our proprietary drug discovery programs, as part of our strategy we may choose to advance them into preclinical and clinical development ourselves, enter\ninto collaborations to co-develop them with leading industry partners, or out-license them to maximize their clinical and commercial opportunities.\nWe may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on\nterms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to maintain or expand our operations and invest in our\nplatform, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition. In addition, we may seek additional capital\ndue to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 include lease obligations of $182.2 million, consisting of our continuing rent obligations through\nDecember 2037, primarily for our offices located in New York, New York for $138.4 million, Cambridge, Massachusetts for $15.2 million, Framingham, Massachusetts\nfor $10.5 million and San Diego, California for $5.5 million, which expire in December 2037, June 2032, March 2033 and January 2031, respectively. In addition, see\nNote 5, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for information relating to our operating lease obligations.\nIn December 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third-party to establish an exclusive integrated drug discovery dedicated facility in Hyderabad, India.\nThe agreement contains a minimum payment obligation, which totals $21.8 million over five years after the date of first occupancy.\nIn December 2020, we entered into a five-year agreement with a third-party cloud provider for compute power. The agreement contains a minimum payment\nobligation, which totals $60.0 million over the five years after the date we entered into the agreement. There is no annual commitment.\nWe also enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CRO vendors for research, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, professional consultants\nfor expert advice, and other vendors for various products and services. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancellable at any\ntime by us, generally upon 30 days prior written notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. We have\nalso agreed to pay volume-based royalties to third-parties for use of software functionality under various licensing and related agreements. See Note 2, \"Significant\nAccounting Policies\" to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\nfor more information relating to our royalty obligations.\n42\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods shown:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (126,255) $ (99,478)\nNet cash provided by investing activities 125,361 252,648\nNet cash provided by financing activities 10,004 6,721\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 9,110 $ 159,891\nOperating activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities used approximately $126.3 million of cash, primarily due to a net loss of $146.9\nmillion, which included a $27.8 million non-cash gain on changes in fair value and $1.8 million of non-cash operating expenses, depreciation and investment accretion\ncosts.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThere have been no material changes in our reported market risks or risk management policies since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2024.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The term “disclosure\n43\nTable of Contents\ncontrols and procedures,” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange\nCommission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its\nprincipal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their\nobjectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred\nduring the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report and our\nother public filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. The occurrence of any of the following risks, or of additional\nrisks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could cause our business, prospects, operating results, and financial\ncondition to suffer materially.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have a history of significant operating losses, and we expect to incur losses over the next several years.\nWe have a history of significant operating losses. Our net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $38.1 million and $146.9 million,\nrespectively. Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $62.0 million. Our net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $71.4\nmillion. Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $40.7 million. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $149.2 million. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $485.3 million. The net income we generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year\nended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the $147.2 million cash distributions we received from Nimbus Therapeutics, LLC, or Nimbus, on account of our equity\nstake in Nimbus, following the acquisition by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company, Limited, or Takeda, of Nimbus Lakshmi, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nimbus,\nand its TYK2 inhibitor NDI-034858 and the non-cash gain on our investment in Structure Therapeutics Inc., or Structure Therapeutics, which, following Structure\nTherapeutics' initial public offering in February 2023, we valued based on the closing price of its American Depositary Shares as of December 31, 2023. However, the\npotential for future distributions from, or gains in the fair value of, our equity stakes in our drug discovery collaborators are difficult to predict due to the inherent\nuncertainty of the events which may trigger such distributions or gains. We therefore expect that gain on equity investments and fair value gains and losses will fluctuate\nsignificantly in future periods.\nWe anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in our proprietary drug discovery\nprograms, sales and marketing infrastructure, and our computational platform. We are still in the early stages of development of our own proprietary drug discovery\nprograms. We have no drug products approved or licensed for commercial sale, and as such, have not generated any revenue from our own drug product sales to date.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our operating expenses and net income or loss may fluctuate\nsignificantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and you should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or annual periods as indications of future results. We\nanticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n• continue to invest in and develop our computational platform and software solutions;\n• continue our research and development efforts for our proprietary drug discovery programs;\n• conduct preclinical studies and initiate and conduct clinical trials for any of our product candidates;\n• prepare and make regulatory submissions for any of our product candidates;\n• maintain, expand, enforce, defend, and protect our intellectual property;\n• hire additional software engineers, programmers, sales and marketing, and other personnel to support our software business and other commercial\noperations;\n• hire additional clinical, quality control, regulatory, chemical, manufacturing and control and other scientific personnel; and\n• add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel to support our operations as a public company.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to increase sales of our software, increase revenue from our drug discovery collaborations, or if we and our current and future collaborators are\nunable to successfully develop and commercialize drug products, our revenues may be insufficient for us to achieve or maintain profitability.\nTo achieve and maintain profitability, we must succeed in significantly increasing our software sales and increasing revenue from our drug discovery\ncollaborations, or we and our current or future collaborators must succeed in developing, and eventually commercializing, a drug product or drug products that generate\nsignificant revenue. We currently generate revenues from the sales of our software solutions and from achieving milestones under our collaborative drug discovery\nprograms, and we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from sales of our software and from achieving such milestones until such time as our or our\ncollaborators’ drug development and commercialization efforts are successful, if ever. As such, increasing sales of our software to existing customers, successfully\nmarketing our software to new customers, and achieving milestones under our drug discovery collaborations are critical to our success. Demand for our software\nsolutions may be affected by a number of factors, including continued market acceptance by the biopharmaceutical industry, market adoption of our software solutions\nbeyond the biopharmaceutical industry including for materials science applications, the ability of our platform to identify more promising molecules and accelerate and\nlower the costs of discovery as compared to traditional methods, timing of development and release of new offerings by our competitors, technological change, and the\nrate of growth in our target markets. If we are unable to continue to meet the demands of our customers, our business operations, financial results, and growth prospects\nwill be adversely affected.\nAchieving success in drug development will require us or our current or future collaborators to be effective in a range of challenging activities, including\ncompleting preclinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing, and\nselling any products for which we or they may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the early stages of most of these activities, and none of our current drug\ndiscovery collaborators have completed clinical development of any product candidate. We and our drug discovery collaborators may never succeed in these activities\nand, even if we do, we may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve and sustain profitability, or even if our collaborators do, we may not receive\noption fees, milestone payments, or royalties from them that are significant enough for us to achieve and sustain profitability. Because of the intense competition in the\nmarket for our software solutions and the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict\nwhen, or if, we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain\nprofitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts,\nincrease sales of our software, develop a pipeline of product candidates, enter into collaborations, or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our\ncompany could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nOur revenue has and may continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. For example, our total revenues decreased by 16% from $142.5\nmillion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $119.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and increased by 20% from $181.0 million in the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022 to $216.7 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Although we have experienced revenue growth in certain periods,\nwe have also experienced revenue loss in certain periods, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth and we may experience certain periods of revenue decline. You\nshould not consider our revenue growth in prior periods as indicative of our future performance. As we grow our business, our revenue growth rates may slow in future\nperiods.\nOur quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nOur results of operations, including our revenues, gross margin, profitability, and cash flows, have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that\nthey will continue to do so. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and our quarterly and annual results should not be\nrelied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside\nof our control. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial results include, without limitation, those listed elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\"\nsection and those listed below:\n• customer renewal rates and the timing and terms of customer renewals, including the seasonality of customer renewals of our on-premise software\narrangements, for which revenue historically has been recognized at a single point in time in the first and fourth quarter of each fiscal year;\n• our ability to attract new customers for our software;\n46\nTable of Contents\n• the addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations of such customers;\n• the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure;\n• network outages or security breaches;\n• industry and market conditions, including within the life sciences industry;\n• general economic conditions, including the impact of increasing or decreasing inflation and interest rates;\n• our ability to collect receivables from our customers;\n• the amount of software purchased by our customers, including the mix of on-premise and hosted software sold during a period;\n• variations in the timing of the sales of our software, which may be difficult to predict;\n• changes in the pricing of our solutions and in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n• the timing and success of the introduction of new software solutions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our\nindustry, including consolidation among competitors, customers, or strategic collaborators;\n• changes in the fair value of or receipt of distributions or proceeds on account of the equity interests we hold in our drug discovery collaborators, such as\nStructure Therapeutics and Nimbus;\n• the success of our drug discovery collaborators in developing and commercializing drug products for which we are entitled to receive milestone\npayments or royalties;\n• the timing of the recognition of milestones achieved under our collaborative programs;\n• variations in the number and size of milestones achieved under our collaborative programs;\n• the timing of recognition of revenue from any payments from entering into collaborations or out-licensing our proprietary drug discovery programs, such\nas under our collaboration agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, and Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis; and\n• the timing of expenses related to our drug discovery programs, the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges\nfor impairment of goodwill from acquired companies.\nIn addition, because we recognize revenues from our hosted software solutions ratably over the term of the agreement, a significant upturn or downturn in sales\nof our hosted software solutions may not be reflected immediately in our operating results. As a result of these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of\nour operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and that our interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year or\nfor any subsequent interim period.\nWe will likely require additional capital to fund our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all or generate cash flows\nnecessary to maintain or expand our operations, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations, and financial condition.\nWe expect to devote substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities, including the development of drug discovery programs and continued\ninvestment in our computational platform. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we\nadvance our proprietary drug discovery programs, initiate or progress preclinical and IND-enabling studies, submit IND applications, initiate and progress clinical trials\nand invest in the further development of our computational platform. In addition, if we decide to complete clinical development and seek regulatory approval on our\nown, we expect to incur significant additional expenses. Furthermore, we incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, as compared to when we\nwere a private company.\nOur current drug discovery collaborators, from whom we are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of various development, regulatory, and\ncommercial milestones as well as royalties on commercial sales, if any, under the collaboration agreements that we have entered into with them, face numerous risks in\nthe development of drugs, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approval, and achieving product sales. In addition, the amounts\nwe are entitled to receive upon the achievement of such milestones tend to be smaller for near-\n47\nTable of Contents\nterm development milestones and increase if and as a collaborative product candidate advances through regulatory development to commercialization and will vary\ndepending on the level of commercial success achieved, if any. We do not anticipate receiving significant milestone payments from many of our drug discovery\ncollaborators for several years, if at all, and our drug discovery collaborators may never achieve milestones that would result in significant cash payments to us. In\naddition, while we have equity stakes in a number of our collaborators, the value of these equity stakes can vary significantly based on a number of factors beyond our\ncontrol, and there can be no assurance that we can rely on such equity as capital to fund our operations. For these reasons we may need, or choose, to obtain additional\ncapital to fund our continuing operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities of $398.4 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash\nequivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least\nthe next 24 months. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plans may change as a result of many factors\ncurrently unknown to us. As a result, we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n• the growth of our software revenue;\n• the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts;\n• the continued expansion of software sales and marketing activities;\n• the timing and receipt of payments from our drug discovery collaborations;\n• spending to support, advance, and broaden our proprietary drug discovery programs; and\n• the timing and receipt of any distributions or proceeds we may receive from our equity stakes in our drug discovery collaborators.\nIn the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may seek\nadditional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If\nwe are unable to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all or generate cash flows necessary to maintain or expand our operations and invest in our\ncomputational platform, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations, and financial condition.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations, or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug programs.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders’ ownership interests will be diluted, and\nthe terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights as common stockholders. Debt financing and\npreferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring\nadditional debt, selling or licensing our assets, making product acquisitions, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to\nrelinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to\nus or agree to exploit a drug development target exclusively for one of our collaborators when we may prefer to pursue the drug development target for ourselves.\nIf our estimates, judgments or assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations\nchange, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make\njudgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience, known trends and events, our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information and various other factors that we\n48\nTable of Contents\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Part II, Item 7. \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations—Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Critical Accounting Estimates\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent\nfrom other sources. Significant judgment, assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include, with respect to revenue,\ndetermining the allocation of the transaction price and measurement of progress, including (1) the constraint on variable consideration, (2) the allocation of the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations using their standalone selling price basis, and (3) the appropriate input or output based method to recognize\ncollaboration revenue and the extent of progress to date.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could\ncause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are\nrelevant to us. As a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies,\nalter our operational policies, and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required\nto restate our published financial statements. Such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation,\nbusiness, financial position, and profit.\nRisks Related to Our Software\nIf our existing customers do not renew their licenses, do not buy additional solutions from us, or renew at lower prices, our business and operating results will\nsuffer.\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our software revenues from renewal of existing license agreements. As a result, maintaining the renewal\nrate of our existing customers and selling additional software solutions to them is critical to our future operating results. Factors that may affect the renewal rate for our\ncustomers and our ability to sell additional solutions to them include:\n• the price, performance, and functionality of our software solutions;\n• the availability, price, performance, and functionality of competing software solutions;\n• the effectiveness of our professional services;\n• our ability to develop or acquire complementary software solutions, applications, and services;\n• the success of competitive products or technologies;\n• the stability, performance, and security of our technological infrastructure;\n• the business environment of our customers;\n• the willingness of our customers to continue to adopt computational approaches to drug discovery, which can be impacted by changes in our customer’s\nmanagement and/or scientific personnel; and\n• the decisions of our customers to discontinue or reduce the amount of drug discovery they undertake internally.\nWe deliver our software through either (i) a product license that permits our customers to install the software solution directly on their own in-house hardware\nand use it for a specified term, or (ii) a subscription that allows our customers to access the cloud-based software solution on their own hardware without taking control\nof the licenses. Our customers have no obligation to renew their product licenses or subscriptions for our software solutions after the license term expires, which is\ntypically after one year, and many of our contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. In addition, our customers may negotiate\nterms less advantageous to us upon renewal, which may reduce our revenues from these customers. Factors that are not within our control may contribute to a reduction\nin our software revenues. For instance, our customers may reduce the number of their employees who are engaged in research and who would have use of our software,\nwhich would result in a corresponding reduction in the number of user licenses needed for some of our solutions and thus a lower aggregate renewal fee. The loss,\nreduction in scope, or delay of a large contract, or the loss or delay of multiple contracts, could materially adversely affect our business.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOur future operating results also depend, in part, on our ability to sell new software solutions and licenses to our existing customers. For example, the\nwillingness of existing customers to license our software will depend on our ability to scale and adapt our existing software solutions to meet the performance and other\nrequirements of our customers, which we may not do successfully. If our customers fail to renew their agreements, renew their agreements upon less favorable terms or\nat lower fee levels, or fail to purchase new software solutions and licenses from us, our revenues may decline and our future revenues may be constrained.\nOur software sales cycle can vary and be long and unpredictable.\nThe timing of sales of our software solutions is difficult to forecast because of the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle. We sell our solutions primarily\nto biopharmaceutical companies, and our sales cycles can be as long as nine to twelve months or longer. Further, the length of time that potential customers devote to\ntheir testing and evaluation, contract negotiation, and budgeting processes varies significantly, depending on the size of the organization and the nature of their needs. In\naddition, we might devote substantial time and effort to a particular unsuccessful sales effort, and as a result, we could lose other sales opportunities or incur expenses\nthat are not offset by an increase in revenue, which could harm our business.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated by sales to life sciences industry customers, and factors that adversely affect this industry could adversely affect\nour software sales.\nA significant portion of our current software sales are to customers in the life sciences industry, in particular the biopharmaceutical industry. Demand for our\nsoftware solutions could be affected by factors that adversely affect the life sciences industry. The life sciences industry is highly regulated and competitive and has\nexperienced periods of considerable consolidation. Consolidation among our customers could cause us to lose customers, decrease the available market for our\nsolutions, and adversely affect our business. In addition, changes in regulations that make investment in the life sciences industry less attractive or drug development\nmore expensive could adversely impact the demand for our software solutions. For these reasons and others, selling software to life sciences companies can be\ncompetitive, expensive, and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully complete a software\nsale. Accordingly, our operating results and our ability to efficiently provide our solutions to life sciences companies and to grow or maintain our customer base could\nbe adversely affected as a result of factors that affect the life sciences industry generally.\nWe also intend to continue leveraging our solutions for broad application to industrial challenges in molecule design, including in the fields of aerospace,\nenergy, semiconductors, and electronic displays. However, we believe the materials science industry is in the very early stages of recognizing the potential of\ncomputational methods for molecular discovery, and there can be no assurance that the industry will adopt computational methods such as our platform. Any factor\nadversely affecting our ability to market our software solutions to customers outside of the life sciences industry, including in these new fields, could increase our\ndependence on the life sciences industry and adversely affect the growth rate of our revenues, operating results, and business.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe overall market for molecular discovery and design software is global, rapidly evolving, competitive, and subject to changing technology and shifting\ncustomer interests and priorities. Our software solutions face competition from competitors in the business of selling or providing simulation and modeling software to\nbiopharmaceutical companies. These competitors include BIOVIA, a brand of Dassault Systèmes SE, or BIOVIA, Chemical Computing Group (US) Inc., Cresset\nBiomolecular Discovery Limited, Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Optibrium Limited, Cyrus Biotechnology, Inc., Molsoft LLC, Insilico Medicine, Inc., Iktos, XtalPi\nInc., Inductive Bio, Inc., Chemaxon, PerkinElmer, Inc., and Simulations Plus, Inc.\nWe also have competitors in materials science, such as BIOVIA and Materials Design, Inc., and in enterprise software for the life sciences, such as BIOVIA,\nCertara USA, Inc., Chemaxon, Revvity, Inc., and Dotmatics, Inc. In some cases, these competitors are well-established providers of these solutions and have long-\nstanding relationships with many of our current and potential customers, including large biopharmaceutical companies. In addition, there are academic consortia that\ndevelop physics-based simulation programs for life sciences and materials applications. In the life sciences industry, the most prominent academic simulation packages\ninclude AMBER, CHARMm, GROMACS, GROMOS,\n50\nTable of Contents\nOpenMM, and OpenFF. These packages are primarily maintained and developed by graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, often without the intent of\ncommercialization.\nWe also face competition from solutions that biopharmaceutical companies develop internally and from smaller companies that offer products and services\ndirected at more specific markets than we target, enabling these smaller competitors to focus a greater proportion of their efforts and resources on these markets, as well\nas a large number of companies that have been founded with the goal of applying machine learning technologies to drug discovery.\nMany of our competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their software solutions and services. It is possible that\nour focus on proprietary drug discovery will result in loss of management focus and resources relating to our software business, thereby resulting in decreasing revenues\nfrom our software business. Furthermore, third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition could acquire\nour current or potential competitors. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their\nproduct offerings or resources. If our competitors’ products, services, or technologies become more accepted than our solutions, if our competitors are successful in\nbringing their products or services to market earlier than ours, if our competitors are able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities,\ntechnologies, or customer requirements, or if their products or services are more technologically capable than ours, then our software revenues could be adversely\naffected.\nIn addition, we are facing increasing competition from companies utilizing artificial intelligence, or AI, and other computational approaches for drug discovery.\nSome of these competitors are involved in drug discovery themselves and/or with partners, and others develop software or other tools utilizing AI which can be used,\ndirectly or indirectly, in drug discovery. To the extent these other AI approaches to drug discovery prove to be successful, or more successful, than our approach, the\ndemand for our platform could be adversely affected, which could affect our software demand as well as reduce the demand for us as a collaborator in drug discovery.\nWe may be required to decrease our prices or modify our pricing practices in order to attract new customers or retain existing customers due to increased\ncompetition. Pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or a failure to maintain or improve our competitive\nmarket position, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts that further enhance our computational platform. Such investments may\naffect our operating results, and, if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect, our revenue and operating results may suffer.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts that further enhance our computational platform, often in response to our\ncustomers’ requirements. These investments may involve significant time, risks, and uncertainties, including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments\nmay affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with\nthese new investments. The software industry changes rapidly as a result of technological and product developments, which may render our solutions less desirable. For\nexample, in recent years, a number of companies have entered the drug discovery industry utilizing different AI approaches. While we believe we compete favorably\nand are meaningfully differentiated from such approaches with the combination of our physics-based computational platform and machine learning capabilities, the\nsuccess of other such AI approaches to drug discovery could impact the demand for our solutions. We believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of\ntime and resources in our platform and software solutions to maintain and improve our competitive position. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these\ninvestments, if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, if technological developments render our solutions less desirable, or if a slowdown in general computing\npower impacts the rate at which we expect our physics-based simulations to increase in power and domain applicability, our revenue and operating results may be\nadversely affected.\nIf we are unable to collect receivables from our customers, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWhile the majority of our current customers are well-established, large companies and universities, we also provide software solutions to smaller companies.\nOur financial success depends upon the creditworthiness and ultimate collection of amounts due from our customers, including our smaller customers with fewer\nfinancial resources. If we are not able to collect amounts due from our customers, we may be required to write-off significant accounts receivable and recognize bad\ndebt expenses, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\n51\nTable of Contents\nDefects or disruptions in our solutions could result in diminishing demand for our solutions, a reduction in our revenues, and subject us to substantial liability.\nOur software business and the level of customer acceptance of our software depend upon the continuous, effective, and reliable operation of our software and\nrelated tools and functions. Our software solutions are inherently complex and may contain defects or errors. Errors may result from our own technology or from the\ninterface of our software solutions with legacy systems and data, which we did not develop. The risk of errors is particularly significant when a new software solution is\nfirst introduced or when new versions or enhancements of existing software solutions are released. We have from time to time found defects in our software, and new\nerrors in our existing software may be detected in the future. Any errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our software could hurt our reputation\nand may damage our customers’ businesses. If that occurs, our customers may delay or withhold payment to us, cancel their agreements with us, elect not to renew,\nmake service credit claims, warranty claims, or other claims against us, and we could lose future sales. The occurrence of any of these events could result in diminishing\ndemand for our software, a reduction of our revenues, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable, require us to increase our warranty provisions, or incur\nthe expense of litigation or substantial liability.\nWe rely upon third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure to host our software solutions. Any disruption in the operations of these third-party providers,\nlimitations on capacity, or interference with our use could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe outsource substantially all of the infrastructure relating to our hosted software solutions to third-party hosting services. Customers of our hosted software\nsolutions need to be able to access our computational platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance, and we provide them with service-level\ncommitments with respect to uptime. Our hosted software solutions depend on protecting the virtual cloud infrastructure hosted by third-party hosting services by\nmaintaining its configuration, architecture, features, and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers, which is\ntransmitted by third-party internet service providers. Any limitation on the capacity of our third-party hosting services could impede our ability to onboard new\ncustomers or expand the usage of our existing customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any\nincident affecting our third-party hosting services’ infrastructure that may be caused by cyber-attacks, natural disasters, fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss,\ntelecommunications failures, terrorist or other attacks, and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect our cloud-based solutions. A prolonged\nservice disruption affecting our cloud-based solutions for any of the foregoing reasons would negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and could damage our\nreputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs\nfor using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the third-party hosting services we use.\nIn the event that our service agreements with our third-party hosting services are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of services or features\nthat we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as\nsignificant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our hosted software solutions for deployment on a\ndifferent cloud infrastructure service provider, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers\nmay reduce the use of or stop using our solutions, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur solutions involve the collection, analysis, and storage of our customers’ proprietary information and sensitive proprietary data related to the discovery\nefforts of our customers. As a result, unauthorized access or security breaches, as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise could result in\nthe loss of information, litigation, indemnity obligations, damage to our reputation, and other liability. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or\nsabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to\nimplement adequate preventative measures. In addition, if our employees fail to adhere to practices we have established to maintain a firewall between our drug\ndiscovery group, which we refer to as the Schrödinger therapeutics group, and our teams that work with software customers, or if the technical solutions we have\nadopted to maintain the firewall malfunction, our customers and collaborators may lose confidence in our ability to maintain the confidentiality of their intellectual\nproperty, we may have trouble attracting new customers and collaborators, we may be subject to breach of contract claims by our customers and collaborators, and we\nmay suffer reputational and other harm as a result. Any or all of these issues could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing\n52\nTable of Contents\ncustomers to elect to not renew their licenses, result in reputational damage or subject us to third-party lawsuits or other action or liability, which could adversely affect\nour operating results. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover losses associated with such events, and in any case, such insurance may not cover all of the types of\ncosts, expenses, and losses we could incur to respond to and remediate a security breach.\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our operating results.\nOur customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our solutions, as our software requires expert usage to fully exploit its\ncapabilities. Certain of our customers also rely on us to troubleshoot problems with the performance of the software, introduce new features requested for specific\ncustomer projects, inform them about the best way to set up and analyze various types of simulations and illustrate our techniques for drug discovery using examples\nfrom publicly available data sets. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for these support services.\nIncreased customer demand for our services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales\nprocess is highly dependent on the reputation of our solutions and business and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to offer high-\nquality technical support, or a market perception that we do not offer high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our solutions to\nexisting and prospective customers and our business and operating results.\nOur solutions utilize third-party open-source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open-source software licenses could\nadversely affect our business or our ability to sell our software solutions, subject us to litigation, or create potential liability.\nOur solutions include software licensed by third parties under any one or more open-source licenses, including the GNU General Public License, the GNU\nLesser General Public License, the Affero General Public License, the BSD License, the MIT License, the Apache License, and others, and we expect to continue to\nincorporate open-source software in our solutions in the future. Moreover, we cannot ensure that we have effectively monitored our use of open-source software or that\nwe are in compliance with the terms of the applicable open-source licenses or our current policies and procedures. There have been claims against companies that use\nopen-source software in their products and services asserting that the use of such open-source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights. As a result,\nwe and our customers could be subject to suits by third parties claiming that what we believe to be licensed open-source software infringes such third parties’\nintellectual property rights, and we may be required to indemnify our customers against such claims. Additionally, if an author or other third party that distributes such\nopen-source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we or our customers could be required to incur\nsignificant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contain the open-\nsource software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these solutions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these solutions.\nLitigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, or require us to devote additional\nresearch and development resources to change our solutions.\nUse of open-source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties\nor other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code, including with respect to security vulnerabilities. In addition, certain open-\nsource licenses require that source code for software programs that interact with such open-source software be made available to the public at no cost and that any\nmodifications or derivative works to such open-source software continue to be licensed under the same terms as the open-source software license. The terms of various\nopen-source licenses have not been interpreted by courts in the relevant jurisdictions, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes\nunanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our solutions. By the terms of certain open-source licenses, we could be required to release the source\ncode of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open-source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open-source\nsoftware in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open-source license, we could be required to\npublicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our solutions, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our solutions, each of\nwhich could reduce or eliminate the value of our solutions. Disclosing our proprietary source code could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower\ndevelopment effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales. Any of these events could create liability for us and damage our reputation, which could have\na material adverse effect on our revenue, business, results of operations, and financial condition and the market price of our shares.\n53\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Drug Discovery\nWe may never realize a return on our investment of resources and cash in our drug discovery collaborations.\nWe use our computational platform to provide drug discovery services to collaborators who are engaged in drug discovery and development. These\ncollaborators include start-up companies, pre-commercial biotechnology companies, and large-scale pharmaceutical companies. When we engage in drug discovery\nwith these collaborators, we typically provide access to our platform and platform experts who assist the drug discovery collaborator in identifying molecules that have\nactivity against one or more specified protein targets. We historically have not received significant initial cash consideration for these services, except for the upfront\npayment of $55.0 million we received from BMS upon entry into our collaboration agreement with BMS and the upfront payment of $150.0 million that we expect to\nreceive from Novartis in connection with our entry into the research collaboration and license agreement with Novartis. However, we have received equity consideration\nin certain of our collaborators and/or the right to receive option fees, cash milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory, and\ncommercial sales milestones for the drug discovery targets, and potential royalties. From time to time, we have also made additional equity investments in our drug\ndiscovery collaborators.\nWe may never realize a return on our investment of resources and cash in our drug discovery collaborations. Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and\nexpensive process, with an uncertain outcome. Our drug discovery collaborators may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable\nto complete, the development and commercialization of any product candidates. In addition, our ability to realize return from our drug discovery collaborations is\nsubject to the following risks:\n• drug discovery collaborators have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to our\ncollaborations and may not perform their obligations as expected;\n• drug discovery collaborators may not pursue development or commercialization of any product candidates for which we are entitled to option fees,\nmilestone payments, or royalties or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on results of clinical trials or\nother studies, changes in the collaborator’s strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create\ncompeting priorities;\n• drug discovery collaborators may delay clinical trials for which we are entitled to milestone payments;\n• we may not have access to, or may be restricted from disclosing, certain information regarding our collaborators’ product candidates being developed or\ncommercialized and, consequently, may have limited ability to inform our stockholders about the status of, and likelihood of achieving, milestone\npayments or royalties under such collaborations;\n• drug discovery collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with any product\ncandidates and products for which we are entitled to milestone payments or royalties if the collaborator believes that the competitive products are more\nlikely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive;\n• product candidates discovered in drug discovery collaborations with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product\ncandidates or products, which may cause our collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of any such product candidates;\n• existing drug discovery collaborators and potential future drug discovery collaborators may begin to perceive us to be a competitor more generally,\nparticularly as we advance our proprietary drug discovery programs, and therefore may be unwilling to continue existing collaborations with us or to\nenter into new collaborations with us;\n• a drug discovery collaborator may fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the development, manufacture, distribution, or\nmarketing of a product candidate or product, which may impact our ability to receive milestone payments;\n• disagreements with drug discovery collaborators, including disagreements over intellectual property or proprietary rights, contract interpretation, or the\npreferred course of development, might cause delays or terminations of the research, development, or commercialization of product candidates for which\nwe are eligible to receive milestone payments, or might result in litigation or arbitration;\n• drug discovery collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, enforce, defend or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights or may use our\nproprietary information in such a way as to potentially lead to\n54\nTable of Contents\ndisputes or legal proceedings that could jeopardize or invalidate our or their intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us and them to\npotential litigation;\n• drug discovery collaborators may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties, which may\nexpose us to litigation and potential liability;\n• drug discovery collaborators could suffer from operational delays as a result of global health impacts, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic; and\n• drug discovery collaborations may be terminated prior to our receipt of any significant value from the collaboration, which has happened to us in the\npast and may happen to us again in the future.\nOur drug discovery collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates that results in our receipt of option fees, milestone\npayments, or royalties in a timely manner, or at all. If any drug discovery collaborations that we enter into do not result in the successful development and\ncommercialization of drug products that result in option fees, milestone payments, or royalties to us, we may not receive return on the resources we have invested in the\ndrug discovery collaboration. Moreover, even if a drug discovery collaboration initially leads to the achievement of milestones that result in payments to us, it may not\ncontinue to do so.\nWe also rely on collaborators for the development and potential commercialization of product candidates we discover internally when we believe it will help\nmaximize clinical and commercial opportunities for the product candidate. For example, under our collaboration agreement with BMS, after mutual agreement on the\ntargets of interest, the Schrödinger therapeutics group is responsible for the discovery of development candidates. Once a development candidate meeting specified\ncriteria for a target has been identified, BMS will be solely responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of such development candidate. We\ncannot be certain that we will successfully identify additional development candidates for BMS to develop and commercialize under our collaboration agreement.\nFurther, BMS may not achieve the research, development, regulatory and sales milestones for those development candidates that would result in additional payments to\nus. In addition, under our research collaboration and license agreement with Novartis, we will be responsible, together with Novartis, for the discovery of small\nmolecule compounds directed against specified targets pursuant to mutually agreed research plans. After the identification of a development candidate in any project\nplan, Novartis will be solely responsible for the further pre-clinical and clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of products containing all\ncompounds resulting from such project plan. We cannot be certain that we will successfully identify development candidates for Novartis to develop and commercialize\nunder our research collaboration and license agreement. Further, Novartis may not achieve the discovery, development, and commercial milestones for those\ndevelopment candidates that would result in additional payments to us.\nWe may not realize returns on our equity investments in our drug discovery collaborators.\nWe may not realize returns on our equity investments in our drug discovery collaborators. None of the drug discovery collaborators in which we hold equity\ngenerate revenue from commercial sales of drug products. They are therefore dependent on the availability of capital on favorable terms to continue their operations. In\naddition, if the drug discovery collaborators in which we hold equity raise additional capital, our ownership interest in and degree of control over these drug discovery\ncollaborators will be diluted, unless we have sufficient resources and choose to invest in them further or successfully negotiate contractual anti-dilution protections for\nour equity investment. The financial success of our equity investment in any collaborator will likely be dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,\nacquisition, or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation in the value of the equity we hold. The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are\ndynamic, and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies in which we hold equity interests could significantly worsen. Further, valuations of privately held\ncompanies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a\ndecline in value, we may be required to record an impairment, which could negatively impact our financial results. The fair value of our equity interests in public\ncompanies, such as Structure Therapeutics, may fluctuate significantly in future periods since we determine the fair value of such equity interests based on the market\nvalue of such companies’ common stock as of a given reporting date. All of the equity we hold in our drug discovery collaborators is subject to a risk of partial or total\nloss of our investment.\n55\nTable of Contents\nOur drug discovery collaborators have significant discretion in determining when to make announcements, if any, about the status of our collaborations, including\nabout clinical developments and timelines for advancing collaborative programs, and the price of our common stock may decline as a result of announcements of\nunexpected results or developments.\nOur drug discovery collaborators have significant discretion in determining when to make announcements about the status of our collaborations, including\nabout preclinical and clinical developments and timelines for advancing the collaborative programs. While as a general matter we intend to periodically report on the\nstatus of our collaborations, our drug discovery collaborators, and in particular, our privately-held collaborators, may wish to report such information more or less\nfrequently than we intend to or may not wish to report such information at all. The price of our common stock may decline as a result of the public announcement of\nunexpected results or developments in our collaborations, or as a result of our collaborators withholding such information.\nAlthough we believe that our computational platform has the potential to identify more promising molecules than traditional methods and to accelerate drug\ndiscovery, our focus on using our platform technology to discover and design molecules with therapeutic potential may not result in the discovery and development\nof commercially viable products for us or our collaborators.\nOur scientific approach focuses on using our platform technology to conduct \"computational assays\" that leverage our deep understanding of physics-based\nmodeling and theoretical chemistry to design molecules and predict their key properties without conducting time-consuming and expensive physical experiments. Our\ncomputational platform underpins our software solutions, our drug discovery collaborations and our own proprietary drug discovery programs.\nWhile the results of certain of our drug discovery collaborators suggest that our platform is capable of accelerating drug discovery and identifying high quality\nproduct candidates, these results do not assure future success for our drug discovery collaborators or for us with our proprietary drug discovery programs.\nEven if we or our drug discovery collaborators are able to develop product candidates that demonstrate potential in preclinical studies, we or they may not\nsucceed in demonstrating safety and efficacy of product candidates in human clinical trials. For example, in collaboration with us, Nimbus was able to identify a unique\nseries of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, or ACC, allosteric protein-protein interaction inhibitors with favorable pharmaceutical properties that inhibit the activity of the ACC\nenzyme. Nimbus achieved proof of concept in a Phase 1b clinical trial of its ACC inhibitor, firsocostat, and later sold the program to Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead\nSciences, in a transaction valued at approximately $1.2 billion, comprised of an upfront payment and earn outs. Of this amount, $601.3 million has been paid to Nimbus\nto date, and we received a total of $46.0 million in cash distributions in 2016 and 2017. In December 2019, Gilead Sciences announced topline results from its Phase 2\nclinical trial which included firsocostat, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other investigational therapies for advanced fibrosis due to nonalcoholic\nsteatohepatitis, in which the primary endpoint was not met. Gilead Sciences is currently evaluating firsocostat in a Phase 2b clinical trial in combination with Novo\nNordisk A/S’s semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, for compensated cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often\nsusceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and\nclinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidates.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify, discover or develop product candidates and may fail to capitalize on programs, collaborations, or product\ncandidates that may present a greater commercial opportunity or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nResearch programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. As an organization, we are advancing\nSGR-1505, our clinical-stage MALT1 inhibitor, SGR-2921, our clinical-stage CDC7 inhibitor, and SGR-3515, our clinical-stage WEE1/MYT1 inhibitor. We have not\nyet advanced any other programs into clinical development or IND-enabling studies, and we may fail to identify additional product candidates for development.\nSimilarly, a key element of our business plan is to expand the use of our computational platform through an increase in software sales and drug discovery collaborations.\nA failure to demonstrate the utility of our platform by successfully using it ourselves to discover internal product candidates could harm our business prospects.\n56\nTable of Contents\nBecause we have limited resources, we focus our research programs on protein targets where we believe our computational assays are a good substitute for\nexperimental assays, where we believe it is theoretically possible to discover a molecule with properties that are required for the molecule to become a drug and where\nwe believe there is a meaningful commercial opportunity, among other factors. The focus of our initial proprietary drug discovery programs was in the area of oncology,\nand we have only recently begun expanding into other therapeutic areas, including neurology and immunology. We may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with\ncertain programs, collaborations, or product candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. However, the development of any\nproduct candidate we pursue may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful or less successful than another potential product candidate that we might have chosen to pursue on\na more aggressive basis with our capital resources. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish\nvaluable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, partnership, licensing, or other arrangements in cases in which it would have been more\nadvantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. Alternatively, we may allocate internal resources to a product\ncandidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a collaboration.\nOur research programs may show initial promise in identifying potential product candidates internally or with collaborators, yet fail to yield product candidates\nfor clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n• our research methodology or that of any collaborator may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates that are successful in clinical\ndevelopment;\n• potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the product candidates\nunmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval;\n• our current or future collaborators may change their development profiles for potential product candidates or abandon a therapeutic area; or\n• new competitive developments may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, which would have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\nWe rely on contract research organizations to synthesize any molecules with therapeutic potential that we discover. If such organizations do not meet our supply\nrequirements, or if such organizations do not otherwise perform satisfactorily, development of any product candidate we may develop may be delayed.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to synthesize any molecules with therapeutic potential that we discover, including SGR-1505, SGR-2921\nand SGR-3515. Reliance on third parties may expose us to different risks than if we were to synthesize molecules ourselves. Our reliance on these third parties will\nreduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet\nexpected deadlines, or synthesize molecules in accordance with regulatory requirements, if there are disagreements between us and such parties or if such parties are\nunable to expand capacities, we may not be able to fulfill, or may be delayed in producing sufficient product candidates to meet, our supply requirements, and we may\nnot be able to complete, or may be delayed in completing, the necessary preclinical studies to enable us to progress viable product candidates for IND submissions or\nthe necessary clinical trials and we will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully develop and commercialize such product candidates. The\nfacilities of these third parties may also be affected by natural disasters, such as floods or fire, or geopolitical developments or public health pandemics, such as COVID-\n19, or such facilities could face production issues, such as contamination or regulatory concerns following a regulatory inspection of such facility. In such instances, we\nmay need to locate an appropriate replacement third-party facility and establish a contractual relationship, which may not be readily available or on acceptable terms,\nwhich would cause additional delay and increased expense, and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe or any third party may also encounter shortages in the raw materials or active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, necessary to synthesize any molecule we\nmay discover in the quantities needed for preclinical studies or clinical trials, as a result of capacity constraints or delays or disruptions in the market for the raw\nmaterials or API. Even if raw materials or API are available, we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities at an acceptable cost or quality. The failure by us or the\nthird parties to obtain the raw materials or API necessary to synthesize sufficient quantities of any molecule we may discover could delay, prevent, or impair our\ndevelopment efforts and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n57\nTable of Contents\nIf we are not able to establish or maintain collaborations to develop and commercialize any of the product candidates we discover internally, we may have to alter\nour development and commercialization plans for those product candidates and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe expect to rely on future collaborators for the development and potential commercialization of product candidates we discover internally when we believe it\nwill help maximize the clinical and commercial opportunities of the product candidate. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators for these\nactivities, and a number of more established companies may also be pursuing such collaborations. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over\nus due to their size, financial resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization expertise. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for such\ncollaborations will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed\ncollaboration, and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of preclinical studies and clinical trials,\nthe likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and\ncomplexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our\nownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions\ngenerally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether\nsuch a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and\ndocument. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large biopharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced\nnumber of potential future collaborators.\nIf we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a\nproduct candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, or increase our expenditures and undertake\ndevelopment or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may\nneed to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not\nhave sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop any product\ncandidates or bring them to market.\nAs a company, we have very limited experience in clinical development, which may adversely impact the likelihood that we will be successful in advancing our\nprograms.\nWe only began conducting our own proprietary drug discovery efforts in 2018, and as a company, we have very limited experience in clinical development.\nOur limited experience in designing, conducting and completing clinical development activities may adversely impact the likelihood that we will be successful in\nadvancing our programs. Further, any predictions you make about the future success or viability of our proprietary drug discovery programs may not be as accurate as\nthey could be if we had a history of conducting and completing clinical trials and developing our own product candidates.\nFurther, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies governing clinical trials, our\ndevelopment plans may be impacted. For example, in December 2022, with the passage of Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, Congress required\nsponsors to develop and submit a diversity action plan for each phase 3 clinical trial or any other \"pivotal study\" of a new drug or biological product. These plans are\nmeant to encourage the enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. Specifically, action plans must include the\nsponsor’s goals for enrollment, the underlying rationale for those goals, and an explanation of how the sponsor intends to meet them. In addition to these requirements,\nthe legislation directs the FDA to issue new guidance on diversity action plans.\n58\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the European Union, or EU, recently evolved. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR,\nbecame applicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state,\nto both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a\nsingle application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in\neach member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by\nall member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules.\nEach member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. The\nCTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was\nmade under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally,\nsponsors were still permitted to choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be\ngoverned by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.\nAs our proprietary drug discovery business grows, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other known and unknown\nfactors. Our proprietary drug discovery business will need to transition to a business capable of supporting significant clinical development activities. We may not be\nsuccessful in such a transition.\nConducting successful clinical trials requires the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit.\nConducting successful clinical trials requires the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in future clinical trials for any other product candidate we develop is critical to our success. Patient enrollment in\nclinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the severity of disease; size of the patient population; the nature\nof the trial protocol; the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects; the availability of clinical trial\ninvestigators with appropriate competencies and experience; support staff; the number of ongoing clinical trials in the same indication that compete for the same\npatients; proximity of patients to clinical sites; the number and availability of trial sites; the ability to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation\nin the clinical trial; ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; patient compliance; the ability to monitor patients during and after treatment; and the impact of any\nhealth pandemic or epidemic. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-\ntreatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates. Patients may also not participate in our clinical trials if they choose to\nparticipate in contemporaneous clinical trials of competitive products with competitors that have more clinical development experience than we do.\nOur inability to locate and enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays, could require us to abandon one or\nmore clinical trials altogether and could delay or prevent our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased\ndevelopment costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nWe rely on, and plan to continue to rely on, third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to\nmeet deadlines for the completion of such trials, which may prevent or delay our ability to seek or obtain marketing approval for or commercialize our product\ncandidates or otherwise harm our business.\nWe rely on, and plan to continue to rely on, third-party clinical research organizations, in addition to other third parties such as research collaboratives and\nconsortia, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our ongoing, planned and future clinical trials, including for\nSGR-1505, SGR-2921 and SGR-3515. These contract research organizations and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct and timing of these trials and\nsubsequent collection and analysis of data. These third-party arrangements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If\nwe need to enter into alternative arrangements, our product development activities might be delayed.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOur reliance on third parties for research and development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For\nexample, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, and legal, regulatory and scientific standards,\nand our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our responsibility to comply with any such standards. We and these third parties are required to comply with\ncurrent good clinical practices, or cGCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory\nauthorities in Europe and other jurisdictions have similar requirements. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors,\nprincipal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be\ndeemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing\napplications. We cannot assure you that a given regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCP regulations. We also are required to\nregister ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a U.S. government-sponsored database, clinicaltrials.gov, within certain timeframes.\nFailure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nFurthermore, third parties on whom we rely may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. In addition, these third\nparties are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote\nsufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or\nobligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised, our clinical trials may be\nextended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able\nto, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our medicines.\nIn addition, we currently rely on foreign CROs and CMOs, and will likely continue to rely on foreign CROs and CMOs in the future. Foreign CMOs may be\nsubject to U.S. legislation, including sanctions, trade restrictions and other foreign regulatory requirements which could increase the cost or reduce the supply of\nmaterial available to us, delay the procurement or supply of such material or have an adverse effect on our ability to secure significant commitments from governments\nto purchase our potential therapies. Moreover, in September 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the BIOSECURE Act (H.R. 7085), and the Senate\nadvanced a substantially similar bill (S.3558), which legislation, if passed and enacted into law, would restrict the ability of U.S. biopharmaceutical companies like us to\npurchase services or products from, or otherwise collaborate with, specifically named Chinese biotechnology companies and authorizes the U.S. government to impose\nsuch restrictions on entities transacting with additional Chinese biotechnology companies as a condition of U.S. government contract, grant, and loan funding. The\nlegislation passed by the House of Representatives contains a grandfathering provision that would prevent disruption to the provision of services or products furnished\nunder contracts with the targeted biotechnology companies entered before the effective date of the legislation until January 1, 2032. It is possible some of our\ncontractual counterparties could be impacted by this legislation.\nOur reliance on third parties to manufacture our product candidates increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or\nproducts or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing\noperations. We rely and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance, and finished drug product\nfor the preclinical and clinical development of any product candidates we develop ourselves and for any commercial supply of approved products, if any. We have\nlimited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or\ncommercial scale.\nIn order to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, we will need to identify suitable manufacturers with the capabilities to\nmanufacture our compounds in large quantities in a manner consistent with existing regulations. Our third-party manufacturers may be unable to successfully increase\nthe manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up\nactivities and at any other time. If our manufacturers are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the\ndevelopment, testing and clinical trials of that product candidate may be delayed or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate\nmay be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business.\n60\nTable of Contents\nWe do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term supply of any of our product candidates. In the future, we may be\nunable to enter into agreements with third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies of our product candidates, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms.\nEven if we are able to establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party; the possible\nmisappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third\nparty at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the\nfailure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties,\ndelays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions,\nany of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. If the third parties that we engage\nto supply any materials or manufacture product for our preclinical tests and clinical trials should cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience\ndelays in advancing these trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers, and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to\nus. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the substances used to manufacture them or any approved drug we may use in\ncombination trials, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future results of operations\nand our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nIf serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development or commercialization of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or\nlimit our development and/or commercialization efforts for such product candidates.\nIf serious adverse events or undesirable side effects are observed in any of our clinical trials, we may have difficulty recruiting patients to our clinical trials,\npatients may drop out of our trials, or we may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts of one or more product candidates altogether or limit\ndevelopment to certain uses or subpopulations in which the serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more\nacceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. We, the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities or an independent institutional review board may suspend clinical\ntrials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects or patients in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or\nadverse side effects. Some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in early-stage trials have later been\nfound to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Even if the side effects do not preclude the product candidate from obtaining or maintaining\nmarketing approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability versus other therapies. In addition, adverse\nevents which had initially been considered unrelated to the study treatment may later, even following approval and/or commercialization, be found to be caused by the\nstudy treatment. Any of these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\n61\nTable of Contents\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and the results of our clinical trials may not\nsatisfy the requirements of the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we will be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence\nthrough well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to\ncomplete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Success in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical\ntrials does not mean that future clinical trials will be successful. The results of our product candidates in preclinical studies may not be indicative of future results in our\nongoing or later stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA\nand other comparable foreign regulatory authorities despite having progressed through preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to\nnumerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, differences in and adherence to the dosing regimen and\nother trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Patients treated with our product candidates may also be undergoing surgical, radiation and\nchemotherapy treatments and may be using other approved products or investigational new drugs, which can cause side effects or adverse events that are unrelated to\nour product candidate. As a result, assessments of efficacy can vary widely for a particular patient, and from patient to patient and site to site within a clinical trial. This\nsubjectivity can increase the uncertainty of, and adversely impact, our clinical trial outcomes. We do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will\ndemonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain marketing approval to market our product candidates. Most product candidates that begin\nclinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization.\nMoreover, preclinical studies and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that believed their product\ncandidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority approval. We\ncannot guarantee that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will interpret trial results as we do, and more trials than we anticipated could be required\nbefore we are able to submit applications seeking approval of our product candidates. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us,\nto conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates. Even if regulatory approval is secured for any of our product candidates, the terms\nof such approval may limit the scope and use of our product candidate, which may also limit its commercial potential. Furthermore, the approval policies or regulations\nof the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval, which may lead to\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities delaying, limiting or denying approval of our product candidates.\nInterim, initial, \"topline\", and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish in the future may change as more patient data become\navailable and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, initial, preliminary or topline data from our clinical trials, which are based on a preliminary analysis of\nthen-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the\nparticular trial. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient\nenrollment continues and more patient data become available or as patients from our clinical trials continue other treatments for their disease. We will also have to make\nassumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully\nevaluate all data. As a result, the interim, initial, topline or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same trials, or different conclusions or\nconsiderations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Preliminary or topline data also remain subject to audit and\nverification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary or topline data we previously published. As a result, interim,\ninitial, topline and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nAdverse differences between interim data and final data could significantly harm our reputation and business prospects and may cause volatility in the price of\nour common stock.\n62\nTable of Contents\nWe conduct, and we intend to continue to conduct, clinical trials for our product candidates at sites outside the United States. The FDA may not accept data from\ntrials conducted in such locations, and the conduct of trials outside the United States could subject us to additional delays and expense.\nWe conduct, and we intend to continue to conduct, clinical trials for our product candidates at trial sites that are located outside the United States. Although the\nFDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of these data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA.\nIn cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not\napprove the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (ii) the trials were\nperformed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to cGCP regulations; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-\nsite inspection by the FDA, or if the FDA considers such inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other\nappropriate means.\nIn addition, even where the foreign study data are not intended to serve as the sole basis for approval, the FDA will not accept the data as support for an\napplication for marketing approval unless the study satisfies certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by\nqualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs. The FDA must be able to validate the data from the trial, including, if necessary, through an onsite inspection. The\ntrial population must also have a similar profile to the U.S. population and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the\nFDA deems clinically meaningful, except to the extent the disease being studied does not typically occur in the United States. In addition, while these clinical trials are\nsubject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and\nregulations. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from any\ntrial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or\npermanently halt our development of our product candidates or potential product candidates in the future.\nIn addition, the conduct of clinical trials outside the United States could have a significant adverse impact on us. Risks inherent in conducting international\nclinical trials include: clinical practice patterns and standards of care that vary widely among countries; non-U.S. regulatory authority requirements that could restrict or\nlimit our ability to conduct our clinical trials; administrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple non-U.S. regulatory authority schema; foreign exchange\nrate fluctuations; and diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nIf we and any current or future collaborators are unable to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize any\nproduct candidates, or experience delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe are early in our development efforts for our own proprietary drug discovery programs. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect\nwill occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. The success of our and\nany current or future collaborators’ development and commercialization programs will depend on several factors, including the following:\n• successful completion of necessary preclinical studies to enable the initiation of clinical trials;\n• successful enrollment of patients in, and the completion of, the clinical trials;\n• acceptance by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of regulatory filings for any product candidates we and our current or future collaborators may\ndevelop;\n• expanding and maintaining a workforce of experienced scientists and other technical specialists to continue to develop any product candidates;\n• obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for any product candidates we and our current or future\ncollaborators may develop;\n• making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing, clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n• establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for drug products and successfully launching commercial sales, if and when approved;\n63\nTable of Contents\n• acceptance of any product candidates we and our current or future collaborators may develop, if and when approved, by patients, the medical\ncommunity, and third-party payors;\n• effectively competing with other therapies;\n• obtaining and maintaining coverage, adequate pricing, and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;\n• patients’ willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;\n• any restrictions resulting from a health epidemic or pandemic and its collateral consequences may result in internal and external operational delays and\nlimitations; and\n• maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile following receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, including clinical outcomes, the regulatory review process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights,\nand the manufacturing, marketing, and sales efforts of any current or future collaborator. Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an\nuncertain outcome. If we or our current or future collaborators are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize any product\ncandidates, or if we or they experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, we may need to spend significant additional time and resources, which\nwould adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if any product candidate that we may develop receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients,\nthird-party payers and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any product candidate we may develop receives marketing approval, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients,\nthird-party payers and others in the medical community. Sales of medical products depend in part on the willingness of physicians to prescribe the treatment, which is\nlikely to be based on a determination by these physicians that the products are safe, therapeutically effective and cost-effective. In addition, the inclusion or exclusion of\nproducts from treatment guidelines established by various physician groups and the viewpoints of influential physicians can affect the willingness of other physicians to\nprescribe the treatment. We cannot predict whether physicians, physicians’ organizations, hospitals, other healthcare providers, government agencies or private insurers\nwill determine that any of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, is safe, therapeutically effective and cost-effective as compared with competing\ntreatments. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of any product candidates we may develop may require significant resources\nand may not be successful. If any product candidates we may develop do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues\nand we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of any product candidates we may develop, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a\nnumber of factors, including:\n• the efficacy and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n• the potential advantages and limitations compared to alternative treatments;\n• the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;\n• the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n• the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n• the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n• the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n• the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n• the timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n• the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n• the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n• any restrictions on the use of our products, if approved, together with other medications.\n64\nTable of Contents\nClinical trial and product liability lawsuits against us could divert our resources, could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of\nour product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of clinical trial and product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in clinical trials, and we will face an even\ngreater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. While we currently have no product candidates that have been approved for commercial sale, the\nuse of product candidates by us in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products in the future, may expose us to liability claims. These claims might be made by\npatients that use the product, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling such products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims\nthat our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n• decreased demand for any product candidates we may develop;\n• injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n• withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n• significant costs to defend any related litigation;\n• substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n• loss of revenue;\n• reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n• the inability to commercialize any product candidates we may develop.\nWe have insurance coverage in countries in which we conduct clinical trials and will need to increase our insurance coverage if we conduct clinical trials in\nadditional countries or of additional product candidates or if we commence commercialization of any product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive.\nWe may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. If a successful clinical trial or\nproduct liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such\nclaims and our business operations could be impaired.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do, thus\nrendering our products non-competitive, obsolete or reducing the size of our market.\nWe face competition with respect to our and our collaborators’ product candidates from many biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The\nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel\nproducts and product candidates. Our competitors have developed, are developing or may develop products, product candidates that are competitive with or superior to\nour product candidates. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize, internally or with our collaborators, will compete with existing\ntherapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nIn particular, there is intense competition in the field of oncology, which is a focus of our drug discovery efforts. We have competitors both in the United States\nand internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, emerging and\nstart-up companies, universities and other research institutions. We also compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development\npersonnel, which could negatively affect our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan. We also face competition in finding and establishing clinical\ntrial sites, enrolling subjects for clinical trials, assessing combination studies and recruiting credible principal investigators and advisors from key clinical disciplines\nand academic centers.\nFor example, with respect to our MALT1 inhibitor, SGR-1505, which we are advancing for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell\nlymphomas, we are aware of several MALT1 inhibitors in clinical development, including by AbbVie Inc., Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., HotSpot Therapeutics, and\nExelixis, Inc. In addition, we are also aware of other therapeutics, such as bi-specifics and CAR-Ts, both approved and in clinical development, for the treatment of B-\ncell lymphomas.\nWith respect to our CDC7 inhibitor, SGR-2921, which we are advancing for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk\nmyelodysplastic syndrome, we are aware of several CDC7 inhibitors in\n65\nTable of Contents\nPhase 1 clinical development, including by Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Lin BioScience, Inc., and Cancer Research UK.\nWith respect to our WEE1/MYT1 inhibitor, SGR-3515, which we are advancing for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, we are aware of several WEE1\ninhibitors in clinical development, including by Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, Debiopharm International SA, IMPACT Therapeutics, Inc., Shouyao Holdings Co. Ltd.,\nBioCity Biopharma, and Aprea Therapeutics, Inc., as well as a MYT1 inhibitor in clinical development being advanced by Repare Therapeutics Inc. Furthermore, we\nare also aware of a WEE1/MYT1 inhibitor in preclinical development being advanced by Acrivon Therapeutics, Inc.\nLarge pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in particular, have extensive experience in building and accessing networks of expert investigators,\ndesigning and conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and commercializing biotechnology products. These companies also have\nsignificantly greater research and development and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of\ndevelopment, and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical and biotechnology\ncompanies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the product\ncandidates that we develop obsolete. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer,\nmore effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than our products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to\nbe significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary\nto, or necessary for, our programs. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA or other comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities or in discovering, developing and commercializing products in our field before we do.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nDoing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our business.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for\napproximately 30%, 34%, and 25% of our total revenues, respectively. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and\nsubjects us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. We have limited operating experience in some international\nmarkets, and we cannot assure you that our expansion efforts into other international markets will be successful. Our experience in the United States and other\ninternational markets in which we already have a presence may not be relevant to our ability to expand in other markets. Our international expansion efforts may not be\nsuccessful in creating further demand for our solutions outside of the United States or in effectively selling our solutions in the international markets we enter. In\naddition, we face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n• the need to localize and adapt our solutions for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages;\n• data privacy laws which require that customer data be stored and processed in a designated territory or handled in a manner that differs significantly\nfrom how we typically handle customer data;\n• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including employee laws and regulations;\n• different pricing environments, longer sales cycles, and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n• differences in healthcare systems, drug regulation and reimbursement, and drug discovery and development practices and technologies;\n• new and different sources of competition;\n• weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and\nother rights outside of the United States;\n• laws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n66\nTable of Contents\n• compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting, and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax,\nreimbursement and pricing, privacy and data protection, and anti-bribery laws and regulations;\n• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n• restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade\nembargoes, and other trade barriers;\n• changes in social, political, and economic conditions or in laws, regulations, and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development, and\ninvestment both domestically as well as in the other countries and jurisdictions;\n• adverse tax consequences, including the potential for required withholding taxes;\n• global health pandemics or epidemics, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic; and\n• unstable regional, economic and political conditions.\nOur international agreements may provide for payment denominated in local currencies and our local operating costs are denominated in local currencies.\nTherefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars.\nFurthermore, with respect to our proprietary drug discovery programs, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may impact the ability of our contract\nresearch organizations, or CROs, in the region to produce materials we require to conduct certain of our preclinical studies. If we are unable to obtain alternative sources\nfor such materials that we require, the ability for us to timely execute and complete certain of our preclinical studies may be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, we could face heightened risks as a result of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit.\nAs of January 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, is now the sole decision maker for marketing authorizations of\npharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom, except for Northern Ireland, which is subject to European Union rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The United\nKingdom and the European Union have however agreed to the Windsor Framework which fundamentally changes the existing system under the Northern Ireland\nProtocol, including with respect to the regulation of medicinal products in the United Kingdom. Once implemented, the changes introduced by the Windsor Framework\nwill result in the MHRA being responsible for approving all medicinal products destined for the United Kingdom market (including Northern Ireland), and the European\nMedicines Agency, or the EMA, will no longer have any role in approving medicinal products destined for Northern Ireland. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to\nobtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom for our\nproduct candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nA widespread outbreak of an illness or other public health pandemic or epidemic such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively affect various aspects of\nour business and make it more difficult to meet our obligations to our customers, and could result in reduced demand from our customers as well as delays in our\ndrug discovery and development programs.\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected by public health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the markets and\nindustries in which we and our customers and collaborators operate.\nThe public health emergency declarations related to COVID-19 ended on May 11, 2023. The FDA ended certain COVID-19-related policies when the public\nhealth emergency ended and retained others. At this point, it is unclear how, if at all, these developments will impact our efforts to develop and commercialize our\nproduct candidates.\n67\nTable of Contents\nPublic health epidemics or pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, may cause delays in the progress of certain of our and our collaborators’ drug\ndiscovery and development programs, particularly those that are in preclinical studies and clinical trials or that are preparing to enter clinical trials. Relative to our and\nour collaborators’ drug discovery programs, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may in the future result in, disruptions in current and future IND-\nenabling studies and clinical trials, manufacturing disruptions, trial site disruptions and impact the ability to obtain necessary institutional review board, institutional\nbiosafety committee, or other necessary site approvals. These disruptions have caused and may in the future cause delays in certain of our and our collaborators’ drug\ndiscovery programs. For example, our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and our CROs had experienced reductions in the capacity to undertake research-\nscale production and had experienced delays in executing preclinical studies, including our completed IND-enabling studies for SGR-2921. These reductions and delays\nmay reoccur in the future. Furthermore, if our collaborators experience similar delays with their drug discovery and development programs, that could cause additional\ndelays in our achievement of milestones and related revenue. Certain of our customers could experience downturns or uncertainty in their own business because of the\neconomic effects resulting from public health pandemics, which could decrease their spending on our software products and services.\nThe ultimate impact of a resurgence of COVID-19, the emergence of a variant of the COVID-19 virus or an outbreak of any other widespread public health\nepidemic is highly uncertain, not predictable and subject to change, and a resurgence of the recent COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure, our existing customers, and our internal drug discovery team, may experience service outages, and our\nnew customers may experience delays in the deployment of our solutions.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of users and data that our operations infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess\ncapacity in our operations infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers and to support our proprietary drug discovery programs. We also seek to maintain\nexcess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments. In addition, we need to properly\nmanage our technological operations infrastructure in order to support version control, changes in hardware and software parameters and the evolution of our solutions.\nHowever, the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires adequate lead-time. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages,\nand other performance problems. These types of problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses,\nsecurity attacks, fraud, spikes in usage, and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure requirements, our existing customers may experience service outages\nthat may subject us to financial penalties, financial liabilities, and customer losses. If our operations infrastructure fails to keep pace with increased sales and usage,\ncustomers and our internal drug discovery team may experience delays in the deployment of our solutions as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could\nadversely affect our reputation and adversely affect our revenues.\nChanges in tax laws or in their implementation or interpretation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nChanges in tax law may adversely affect our business or financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017 Tax Act, as amended by the Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The 2017 Tax Act, among\nother things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21% and\nlimitation of the deduction for net operating losses, or NOLs, to 80% of current-year taxable income for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31,\n2017 (though any such NOLs may be carried forward indefinitely). In addition, beginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act eliminates the option to deduct research and\ndevelopment expenditures currently and requires corporations to capitalize and amortize them over five years or 15 years (for expenditures attributable to foreign\nresearch).\n68\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the CARES Act, as part of Congress’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic relief legislation was enacted in 2020 and 2021 containing\ntax provisions. The Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, was also signed into law in August 2022. The IRA introduced new tax provisions, including a one percent excise\ntax imposed on certain stock repurchases by publicly traded companies. The one percent excise tax generally applies to any acquisition of stock by the publicly traded\ncompany (or certain of its affiliates) from a stockholder of the company in exchange for money or other property (other than stock of the company itself), subject to a de\nminimis exception. Thus, the excise tax could apply to certain transactions that are not traditional stock repurchases. Regulatory guidance under the 2017 Tax Act, the\nIRA, and such additional legislation is and continues to be forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen the impact of these laws on our business\nand financial condition. Additional tax legislation may be enacted, and any such additional legislation could have an impact on our company. In addition, it is uncertain\nif and to what extent various states will conform to the 2017 Tax Act, the IRA, and additional tax legislation.\nOur ability to use our NOLs and research and development tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had federal NOLs of approximately $179.1 million and state NOLs of approximately $98.6 million, which, if not utilized,\ngenerally begin to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2023, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $23.3 million and\nstate research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.6 million. Unused credits began to expire in 2024 and generally expire over time if they\nremain unused. These NOLs and research and development tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nIn addition, under Section 382 and 383 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change,\" generally\ndefined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, is subject to limitations on its\nability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and research and development tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income. We have performed an analysis through\nDecember 31, 2023 and determined that such an ownership change occurred on March 31, 2021. As a result of such ownership change or future ownership changes, our\nability to use our NOLs and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be materially limited.\nThere is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspension of the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or\notherwise become unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. As described above in \"Changes in tax laws or in their implementation or interpretation could\nadversely affect our business and financial condition,\" the 2017 Tax Act, as amended by the CARES Act, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates and rules governing\nNOL carryforwards that may significantly impact our ability to utilize NOLs to offset taxable income in the future. In addition, state NOLs generated in one state cannot\nbe used to offset income generated in another state. For these reasons, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes.\nOur international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. These jurisdictions include\nGermany, United Kingdom, Japan, India and South Korea. The international nature and organization of our business activities are subject to complex transfer pricing\nregulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and\nexpenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes,\ninterest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added, or similar taxes, and we could be\nsubject to tax liabilities with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added, and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable\nor that we are not required to collect such taxes with respect to the jurisdiction. Sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction.\nCertain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and\nwe may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties, and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations.\n69\nTable of Contents\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could harm our future results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the\nallocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material\ndifferences between our forecasted and actual tax rates. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in federal, state,\nor international tax laws and accounting principles. Increases in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability or in some cases increase our losses.\nIn addition, we may be subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Although we believe our income tax liabilities are\nreasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period\ncould have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.\nWe have acquired, and we may again in the future acquire, companies, businesses, solutions or technologies, which could divert our management’s attention, result\nin additional dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have acquired, and we may again in the future acquire, businesses, solutions, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our solutions,\nenhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, in January 2022, we acquired XTAL BioStructures, Inc., or XTAL, a company\nthat provides structural biology services, including biophysical methods, protein production and purification, and X-ray crystallography, which has augmented our\nability to produce high quality target structures for our drug discovery programs. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause\nus to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nIn addition, other than our acquisition of XTAL, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be\nable to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies successfully, effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition or preserve the\noperational synergies between our business units that we believe currently exist. We cannot assure you that following any acquisition we would achieve the expected\nsynergies to justify the transaction, due to a number of factors, including:\n• inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n• unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n• acquisition-related costs;\n• difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations, and personnel of the acquired business;\n• difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n• difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our solutions and contract terms, including disparities in the revenues, licensing,\nsupport, or professional services model of the acquired company;\n• diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;\n• adverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n• the potential loss of key employees;\n• use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n• use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must\nbe assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results\nbased on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n70\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition,\nif an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial position may suffer.\nOur operations may be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event at our primary facilities.\nOur operations are primarily conducted at our facilities in New York, New York, Portland, Oregon, and Hyderabad, India, and our internal hosting facility\nlocated in Clifton, New Jersey. The occurrence of natural disasters or other catastrophic events could disrupt our operations. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event in\nour facilities or the areas in which they are located could have a significant negative impact on our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our existing license agreements with Columbia University, under any of our other intellectual property licenses, or\nunder any future intellectual property licenses, or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our current or any future licensors, we could\nlose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to a number of license agreements pursuant to which we have been granted exclusive and non-exclusive worldwide licenses to certain patents,\nsoftware code, and software programs to, among other things, reproduce, use, execute, copy, operate, sublicense, and distribute the licensed technology in connection\nwith the marketing and sale of our software solutions and to develop improvements thereto. In particular, the technology that we license from Columbia University\npursuant to our license agreements with them are used in and incorporated into a number of our software solutions which we market and license to our customers. For\nfurther information regarding our license agreements with Columbia University, see \"Item 1. Business—License Agreements with Columbia University\" in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 12, 2024. Our license\nagreements with Columbia University and other licensors impose, and we expect that future licenses will impose, specified royalty and other obligations on us.\nIn spite of our best efforts, our current or any future licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our license agreements with them and might\ntherefore terminate the license agreements, thereby delaying our ability to market and sell our existing software solutions and develop and commercialize new software\nsolutions that utilize technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying intellectual property fails to provide the\nintended exclusivity, competitors could market products and technologies similar to ours. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position,\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nDisputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n• the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation related issues;\n• the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n• the sublicensing of patent and other rights under any collaborative development relationships;\n• the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our current or future\nlicensors and us and our collaborators; and\n• the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, license agreements are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any\ncontract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or\nincrease what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement. For example, our counterparties have in the past and may in the future\ndispute the amounts owed to them pursuant to payment obligations. If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to\nmaintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may experience delays in the development and commercialization of new software\nsolutions and in our ability to market and sell existing software solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects.\n71\nTable of Contents\nOur obligations under our existing or future drug discovery collaboration agreements may limit our intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nFurther, if we fail to comply with our obligations under our existing or future collaboration agreements, or otherwise experience disruptions to our business\nrelationships with our prior, current, or future collaborators, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to collaboration agreements with biopharmaceutical companies, pursuant to which we provide drug discovery services but have no ownership\nrights, or only co-ownership rights, to certain intellectual property generated through the collaborations. We are also party to a collaboration agreement with BMS for\nthe development and potential commercialization of product candidates we discover internally, which also provides for co-ownership rights to certain intellectual\nproperty generated through the collaboration in certain scenarios. We may enter into additional collaboration agreements in the future, pursuant to which we may have\nno ownership rights, or only co-ownership rights, to certain intellectual property generated through the future collaborations. If we are unable to obtain ownership or\nlicense of such intellectual property generated through our prior, current, or future collaborations and overlapping with, or related to, our own proprietary technology or\nproduct candidates, then our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nOur existing collaboration agreements contain certain exclusivity obligations that require us to design compounds exclusively for our collaborators with respect\nto certain specific targets over a specified time period. Our future collaboration agreements may grant similar exclusivity rights to future collaborators with respect to\ntarget(s) that are the subject of such collaborations. Existing or future collaboration agreements may also impose diligence obligations on us. For example, existing or\nfuture collaboration agreements may impose restrictions on us from pursuing the drug development targets for ourselves or for our other current or future collaborators,\nthereby removing our ability to develop and commercialize, or to jointly develop and commercialize with other current or future collaborators, product candidates, and\ntechnology related to the drug development targets. Under our collaboration with BMS, for example, we are prohibited from developing and commercializing product\ncandidates anywhere in the world that are directed at the target specified under the agreement, until the earlier of such target ceasing to be included under the agreement\nor the expiration of the last to expire royalty term for the program related to the target. In spite of our best efforts, our prior, current, or future collaborators might\nconclude that we have materially breached our collaboration agreements. If these collaboration agreements are terminated, or if the underlying intellectual property, to\nthe extent we have ownership or license of such intellectual property, fails to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory\napproval of, and to market, products and technology identical to ours. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and prospects.\nDisputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a collaboration agreement, including:\n• the scope of ownership or license granted under the collaboration agreement and other interpretation related issues;\n• the extent to which our technology and product candidates infringe on intellectual property of the collaborator of which we do not have ownership or\nlicense under the collaboration agreement;\n• the assignment or sublicense of intellectual property rights and other rights under the collaboration agreement;\n• our diligence obligations under the collaboration agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and\n• the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our current or\nfuture collaborators.\nIn addition, collaboration agreements are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of\nany contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property, or increase what\nwe believe to be our obligations under the relevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have owned, co-owned, or in-licensed under the collaboration agreements prevent or\nimpair our ability to maintain our current collaboration arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize\nthe affected technology or product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n72\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain, enforce, and protect patent protection for our technology and product candidates or if the scope of the patent protection\nobtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to\nsuccessfully develop and commercialize our technology and product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection of the intellectual property we may own solely and jointly with others or may\nlicense from others, particularly patents, in the United States and other countries with respect to any proprietary technology and product candidates we develop,\nincluding SGR-1505, SGR-2921, and SGR-3515, and any trade secrets and know-how relevant to our product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by\nfiling patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our technology and any product candidates we may develop that are important to our business and by\nin-licensing intellectual property related to our technology and product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or maintain patent protection with respect to any\nproprietary technology or product candidate, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, defend, or license all\nnecessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and\ndevelopment output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, and\nprosecution of patent applications, or to maintain, enforce, and defend the patents, covering technology that we co-own with third parties or license from third parties.\nTherefore, these co-owned and in-licensed patents and applications may not be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained, defended, and enforced in a manner consistent\nwith the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of software and biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has in recent\nyears been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the scope of patent protection outside of the United States is uncertain, and laws of non-U.S. countries may not\nprotect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or vice versa. With respect to both owned and in-licensed patent rights, we cannot predict whether\nthe patent applications we, our collaborators, and our licensors are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any\nissued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors.\nFor example, in jurisdictions outside the United States, a license may not be enforceable unless all the owners of the intellectual property agree or consent to\nthe license. Accordingly, any actual or purported co-owner of our patent rights could seek monetary or equitable relief requiring us to pay it compensation for, or refrain\nfrom, exploiting these patents due to such co-ownership.\nFurthermore, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, and most other jurisdictions in which we have undertaken patent filings, the natural\nexpiration of a patent is generally twenty years after it is filed, assuming all maintenance fees are paid. Various extensions may be available, on a jurisdiction-by-\njurisdiction basis; however, the life of a patent, and thus the protection it affords, is limited. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and\nregulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result,\npatents we may own or in-license may not provide us with adequate and continuing patent protection sufficient to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or\nidentical to our current or future product candidates, including generic versions of such drugs.\nFurther, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights or prior art potentially relating to our computational platform, technology, and any\nproduct candidates we may develop. In addition, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in\nthe United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing of the priority application, or in some cases not published at all.\nTherefore, neither we nor our collaborators, or our licensor can know with certainty whether either we, our collaborators, or our licensor were the first to make the\ninventions claimed in the patents and patent applications we own or in-license now or in the future, or that either we, our collaborators, or our licensor were the first to\nfile for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our owned, co-owned, and in-licensed\npatent rights are highly uncertain. Moreover, our owned, co-owned, and in-licensed pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that\nprotect our technology and product candidates, in whole or in part, or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our owned, co-owned, or in-\nlicensed current or future patents and our ability to obtain, protect, maintain, defend, and enforce our patent rights, narrow the scope of our patent protection and, more\ngenerally, could affect the value of, or narrow the\n73\nTable of Contents\nscope of, our patent rights. For example, recent Supreme Court decisions have served to curtail the scope of subject matter eligible for patent protection in the United\nStates, and many software patents have since been invalidated on the basis that they are directed to abstract ideas.\nIn order to pursue protection based on our pending provisional patent applications, we will need to file Patent Cooperation Treaty applications, non-U.S.\napplications, and/or U.S. non-provisional patent applications prior to applicable deadlines. Even then, as highlighted above, patents may never issue from our patent\napplications, or the scope of any patent may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage.\nMoreover, we, our collaborators, or our licensors may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,\nor USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review, or interference proceedings challenging our\npatent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding, or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent\nrights or allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us. If the breadth or strength of\nprotection provided by our owned, co-owned, or in-licensed current or future patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade\ncompanies from collaborating with us to license, develop, or commercialize current or future technology or product candidates.\nAdditionally, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after\nissuance. Even if our owned, co-owned, and in-licensed current and future patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any\nmeaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive\nas to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability, and our owned and in-licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and\nabroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit\nour ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and\nproduct candidates. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our management and employees, even if the eventual outcome\nis favorable to us. In particular, given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting\nsuch candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned, co-\nowned, or in-licensed current or future patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. As a result, our owned, co-\nowned, and in-licensed current or future patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing technology and products\nsimilar or identical to any of our technology and product candidates.\nIn addition, we may in the future be subject to claims by our former employees or consultants asserting an ownership right in our patents or patent applications,\nas a result of the work they performed on our behalf. Although we generally require all of our employees, consultants and advisors, and any other third parties who have\naccess to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to assign or grant similar rights to their inventions to us, we cannot be certain that we have executed\nsuch agreements with all parties who may have contributed to our intellectual property, nor can we be certain that our agreements with such parties will be upheld in the\nface of a potential challenge, or that they will not be breached, for which we may not have an adequate remedy.\nChanges to patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our\nproducts.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of patent laws in the United States, including patent reform legislation such as the Leahy-Smith America\nInvents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned and in-licensed patent applications and the\nmaintenance, enforcement or defense of our owned and in-licensed issued patents. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States\npatent law. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues\nfor competitors to challenge the validity of patents, and enable third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to\nattack the validity of a patent at USPTO-administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. Assuming\nthat other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while\noutside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to a\n74\nTable of Contents\nfirst-to-file system in which, assuming that the other statutory requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the\npatent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. As such, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could\nincrease the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of software, biologics and pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain.\nRecent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain\nsituations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents once obtained. Depending on future actions by\nthe U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse\neffect on our patent rights and our ability to protect, defend and enforce our patent rights in the future.\nA number of cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court have involved questions of when claims reciting abstract ideas, laws of nature, natural phenomena\nand/or natural products are eligible for a patent, regardless of whether the claimed subject matter is otherwise novel and inventive. These cases include Association for\nMolecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569 U.S. 12-398 (2013) or Myriad; Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. 13-298 (2014); and Mayo\nCollaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., or Prometheus, 566 U.S. 10-1150 (2012). In response to these cases, federal courts have held numerous patents\ninvalid as claiming subject matter ineligible for patent protection. Moreover, the USPTO has issued guidance to the examining corps on how to apply these cases during\nexamination. As a result of these decisions, obtaining broad patents in the United States covering software innovations is more challenging than before.\nIn addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain future patents, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the\nvalue of patents, once obtained. Depending on these and other decisions by Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents\ncould change or be interpreted in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce any patents that may issue to us in the future. In\naddition, these events may adversely affect our ability to defend any patents that may issue in procedures in the USPTO or in courts.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various deadlines and procedural, document submission, fee payment and other\nrequirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated if we fail to comply with these deadlines and\nrequirements. We may miss a filing deadline for patent protection on these inventions.\nThe USPTO and foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar\nprovisions during the patent application process and after issuance of any patent. In addition, periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and/or various other\ngovernment fees are required to be paid. While an inadvertent lapse can be cured in some cases by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the\napplicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss\nof patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent include, but are not limited to, failure to respond\nto official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event, our competitors\nmight be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or platforms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and financial\ncondition.\nIntellectual property rights do not guarantee commercial success of current or future product candidates or other business activities. Numerous factors may limit\nany potential competitive advantage provided by our intellectual property rights.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights, whether owned or in-licensed, is uncertain because intellectual property rights have\nlimitations, and may not adequately protect our business, provide a barrier to entry against our competitors or potential competitors, or permit us to maintain our\ncompetitive advantage.\n75\nTable of Contents\nMoreover, if a third-party has intellectual property rights that cover the practice of our technology, we may not be able to fully exercise or extract value from our\nintellectual property rights. The following examples are illustrative:\n• patent applications that we own or may in-license may not lead to issued patents;\n• patents, should they issue, that we may own or in-license, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, may be narrowed in scope, or may be\nchallenged and held invalid or unenforceable;\n• others may be able to develop and/or practice technology, including compounds that are similar to the chemical compositions of our current or future\nproduct candidates, that is similar to our technology or aspects of our technology but that is not covered by the claims of any patents we may own or in-\nlicense, should any patents issue;\n• third parties may compete with us in jurisdictions where we do not pursue and obtain patent protection;\n• we, or our future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by a patent application that we own or may in-\nlicense;\n• we, or our future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering a particular invention;\n• others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual\nproperty rights;\n• our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent\ninfringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and may then use the\ninformation learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n• we may not be able to obtain and/or maintain necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all;\n• third parties may assert an ownership interest in our intellectual property and, if successful, such disputes may preclude us from exercising exclusive\nrights, or any rights at all, over that intellectual property;\n• we may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third-party may subsequently file a patent covering such\ntrade secrets or know-how;\n• we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or other proprietary information;\n• we may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n• the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n76\nTable of Contents\nWe, our prior, existing, or future collaborators, and our existing or future licensors, may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patent or other\nintellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors and other third parties may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our, our prior, current and future collaborators’, or our current and future\nlicensors’ issued patents or other intellectual property. As a result, we, our prior, current, or future collaborators, or our current or future licensor may need to file\ninfringement, misappropriation, or other intellectual property related claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived\ninfringers could provoke such parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property. In\naddition, in a patent infringement proceeding, such parties could assert that the patents we, our collaborators, or our licensors have asserted are invalid or unenforceable.\nIn patent litigation in the United States, defenses alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to\nmeet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation\nthat someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third\nparties may institute such claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-\nexamination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in non-U.S. jurisdictions (e.g.,\nopposition proceedings). The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.\nAn adverse result in any such proceeding could put one or more of our owned, co-owned, or in-licensed current or future patents at risk of being invalidated or\ninterpreted narrowly and could put any of our owned, co-owned, or in-licensed current or future patent applications at risk of not yielding an issued patent. A court may\nalso refuse to stop the third party from using the technology at issue in a proceeding on the grounds that our owned, co-owned, or in-licensed current or future patents do\nnot cover such technology. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that\nsome of our confidential information or trade secrets could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Any of the foregoing could allow such third\nparties to develop and commercialize competing technologies and products in a non-infringing manner and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and prospects.\nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties, or brought by us or by our collaborators or licensor, or declared by the USPTO may be\nnecessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related\ntechnology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Our defense of litigation or\ninterference or derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the\nuncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to conduct clinical trials, continue our research\nprograms, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development collaborations that would help us bring any product candidates to market.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of\nwhich would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators and licensor to develop, manufacture, market, and sell any product\ncandidates we may develop and for our collaborators, licensor, customers, and partners to use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating, or\notherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable patent and other intellectual property litigation in the software,\npharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights\nwith respect to our technology and product candidates, including interference proceedings, post grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings before the\nUSPTO and similar proceedings in non-U.S. jurisdictions such as oppositions before the European Patent Office. Numerous U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and\npending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. As the biotechnology and\npharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our technologies or product candidates that we may identify may be subject to\nclaims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\n77\nTable of Contents\nThe legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings is low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be\ninitiated and require significant resources to defend. Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these\nproceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can. The risks of being involved in such litigation\nand proceedings may increase if and as any product candidates near commercialization and as we gain the greater visibility associated with being a public company.\nThird parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of merit. We may not be aware\nof all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our technology and product candidates and their uses, or we may incorrectly conclude that third-party\nintellectual property is invalid or that our activities and product candidates do not infringe such intellectual property. Thus, we do not know with certainty that our\ntechnology and product candidates, or our development and commercialization thereof, do not and will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any third\nparty’s intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with\nclaims to materials, formulations or methods, such as methods of manufacture or methods for treatment, related to the discovery, use or manufacture of the product\ncandidates that we may identify or related to our technologies. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent\napplications which may later result in issued patents that the product candidates that we may identify may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the\nfuture and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. Moreover, as noted above, there may be existing patents that we are not aware of or that we\nhave incorrectly concluded are invalid or not infringed by our activities. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover, for example,\nthe manufacturing process of the product candidates that we may identify, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the\nholders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until\nsuch patents expire.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize\nthe product candidates that we may identify. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial\ndiversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including\ntreble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products, be forced to indemnify our customers, licensor, or\ncollaborators or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nWe may choose to take a license or, if we are found to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could also be\nrequired to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our technology and product candidates. However, we may not be\nable to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our\ncompetitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us and could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We could be\nforced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology or product. A finding of infringement could prevent\nus from commercializing any product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. In addition, we may be\nforced to redesign any product candidates, seek new regulatory approvals and indemnify third parties pursuant to contractual agreements. Claims that we have\nmisappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees, consultants, or contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of\nthird parties, or we have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting we have misappropriated their\nintellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nCertain of our employees, consultants, and contractors were previously employed at universities or other software or biopharmaceutical companies, including\nour competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how\nof others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other\nproprietary information, of any such individual’s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\n78\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require that our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to\nexecute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual\nproperty that we regard as our own. Our intellectual property assignment agreements with them may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to\nbring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our competitive business position and prospects. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and\nwe could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products, which license may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all, or such license may be non-exclusive. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in\nsubstantial costs and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for any product candidates and technology, we also rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our unpatented\nknow-how, technology, and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary technology, in\npart, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside\nscientific collaborators, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, collaborators, and other third parties. We also enter into\nconfidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, but we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements\nwith each party that may have or has had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may inadvertently or\nintentionally breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such\nbreaches. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is\ndifficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling\nto protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right\nto prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to\nor independently developed by a competitor or other third party, our competitive position may be materially and adversely harmed.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may\nprevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or if, and in which\nterritories, we will obtain marketing approval to commercialize a product candidate.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing, promotion and distribution of products are subject to extensive regulation by the\nFDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States or in other countries until we receive\napproval of a new drug application from the FDA or marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities outside the United States. Our product candidates are in\nvarious stages of development and are subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. We have not submitted an application for or received marketing\napproval for any of our product candidates in the United States or in any other jurisdiction. We have no experience as a company in filing and supporting the\napplications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party CROs to assist us in this process.\n79\nTable of Contents\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It may take many years, if approval is\nobtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Securing\nmarketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information, including manufacturing information, to regulatory\nauthorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that our\nproduct candidates are not safe and effective, only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude\nour obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nIn addition, changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment or promulgation of additional statutes,\nregulations or guidance or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application.\nRegulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could\ndelay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-\napproval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nFurther, our ability to develop and market new products may be impacted by litigation challenging the FDA’s approval of mifepristone. In April 2023, the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas stayed the approval by the FDA of mifepristone, a drug product which was originally approved in 2000 and whose\ndistribution is governed by various conditions adopted under a REMS. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit declined to order the removal of mifepristone from the\nmarket, but did hold that plaintiffs were likely to prevail in their claim that changes allowing for expanded access of mifepristone that FDA authorized in 2016 and 2021\nwere arbitrary and capricious. In June 2024, the Supreme Court reversed that decision after unanimously finding that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring this\nlegal action against the FDA. On October 11, 2024, the Attorneys General of three states filed an amended complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof Texas challenging the FDA’s actions. Depending on the outcome of this litigation, our ability to develop and market new drug products could be delayed, undermined\nor subject to protracted litigation.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with\nnumerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval\nmay differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks\nassociated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the\nFDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not\nensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may file for marketing approvals but not receive necessary approvals to\ncommercialize our products in any market.\nWe may seek certain designations for our product candidates, including Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track and Priority Review designations in the United States,\nand PRIME Designation in the European Union, but we might not receive such designations, and even if we do, such designations may not lead to a faster\ndevelopment or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek certain designations for one or more of our product candidates that could expedite review and approval by the FDA. A Breakthrough Therapy\nproduct is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence\nindicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment\neffects observed early in clinical development. For products that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and\nthe sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control\nregimens.\n80\nTable of Contents\nThe FDA may also designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the\ntreatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast\nTrack products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the\napplication is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast\nTrack product may be effective. In July 2024, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to SGR-2921 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.\nWe may also seek a priority review designation for one or more of our product candidates. If the FDA determines that a product candidate offers major\nadvances in treatment or provides a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, the FDA may designate the product candidate for priority review. A priority review\ndesignation means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review period of ten months.\nThese designations are within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for these\ndesignations, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Further, even if we receive a designation, the receipt of such designation for a\nproduct candidate may not result in a faster development or regulatory review or approval process compared to products considered for approval under conventional\nFDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualifies for these designations, the FDA\nmay later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be\nshortened.\nIn the EU, we may seek PRIME designation for our product candidates in the future. PRIME is a voluntary program aimed at enhancing the EMA’s role to\nreinforce scientific and regulatory support in order to optimize development and enable accelerated assessment of new medicines that are of major public health interest\nwith the potential to address unmet medical needs. The program focuses on medicines that target conditions for which there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in\nthe EU or even if such a method exists, it may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments. PRIME is limited to medicines under development and not\nauthorized in the EU and the applicant intends to apply for an initial marketing authorization application through the centralized procedure. To be accepted for PRIME, a\nproduct candidate must meet the eligibility criteria in respect of its major public health interest and therapeutic innovation based on information that is capable of\nsubstantiating the claims. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use rapporteur to provide\ncontinued support and help to build knowledge ahead of a marketing authorization application, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and\nthe potential to qualify products for accelerated review, meaning reduction in the review time for an opinion on approvability to be issued earlier in the application\nprocess. PRIME enables an applicant to request parallel EMA scientific advice and health technology assessment advice to facilitate timely market access. Even if we\nreceive PRIME designation for any of our product candidates, the designation may not result in a materially faster development process, review or approval compared to\nconventional EMA procedures. Further, obtaining PRIME designation does not assure or increase the likelihood of EMA’s grant of a marketing authorization.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain reimbursement for any of our product candidates that do receive marketing\napproval.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare\nsystem that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any\nproduct candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future,\nmay result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved products. If reimbursement of our\nproducts is unavailable or limited in scope, our business could be materially harmed.\n81\nTable of Contents\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability\nReconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the\nBudget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with\nrecommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the\nlegislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per\nfiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through the first half of 2032 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act,\nor the CARES Act. Pursuant to subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions were suspended and reduced in 2021 and 2022 but, as of July 1, 2022, the\nfull 2% cut has resumed. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of\nlimitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and\nother healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency\nwith which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.\nIndeed, under current legislation, the actual reductions in Medicare payments may vary up to 4%. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was signed into\nlaw by President Biden in December 2022, made several changes to sequestration of the Medicare program. Section 1001 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act delays\nthe 4% Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 sequester for two years, through the end of 2024. Triggered by enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the\n4% cut to the Medicare program would have taken effect in January 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act’s health care offset title includes Section 4163, which\nextends the 2% Budget Control Act of 2011 Medicare sequester for six months into 2032 and lowers the payment reduction percentages in 2030 and 2031.\nSince enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the\nlaw. For example, with enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, Congress repealed the \"individual mandate.\" The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to\ncarry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, in December 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that\nthe individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax\nAct, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case and in June 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the\nplaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and\nuncertain results.\nThe Trump Administration also took executive actions to delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and\nresponsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or\nregulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however,\nPresident Biden revoked those orders and issued a new executive order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access\nto health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine\nprotections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may\nreduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health\ninsurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for\ndependents.\n82\nTable of Contents\nIn the European Union, on December 13, 2021, Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was\nadopted. While the HTA entered into force in January 2022, it will only begin to apply from January 2025 onwards, with preparatory and implementation-related steps\nto take place in the interim. Once applicable, it will have a phased implementation depending on the concerned products. The HTA intends to boost cooperation among\nEuropean Union member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products as well as certain high-risk medical devices, and provide the basis\nfor cooperation at the European Union level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. It will permit European Union member states to use common HTA tools,\nmethodologies, and procedures across the European Union, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health\ntechnologies with the highest potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of\nemerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual European Union member states\nwill continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and\nreimbursement.\nWe expect that these healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in\nMedicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for\nany approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in\nreimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in\nreimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Accordingly, such reforms, if enacted,\ncould have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and\nmay affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop or commercialize product candidates.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States and foreign jurisdictions are subject to considerable legislative and executive actions and could\nimpact the prices we obtain for our products, if and when licensed, as well as impact our ability to find collaborators for our drug discovery programs on\ncommercially acceptable terms.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent Congressional\ninquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the\nrelationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020 President Trump issued\nseveral executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These\nregulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-\nadministered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a\nnationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a final rule to rescind it. With the issuance of\nthis rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries’ access to\nevidence-based care.\nIn addition, in October 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to\ndevelop a Section 804 Importation Program to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. That regulation was challenged in a lawsuit by the\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, but the case was dismissed by a federal district court in February 2023 after the court found that\nPhRMA did not have standing to sue HHS. A number of states have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada. Certain of these states have\nsubmitted Section 804 Importation Program proposals and are awaiting FDA approval. In January 2024, the FDA authorized the importation of mass medications from\nCanada into Florida. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation that would eliminate the current safe harbor for Medicare drug rebates and create new\nsafe harbors for beneficiary point-of-sale discounts and pharmacy benefit manager service fees. It originally was set to go into effect on January 1, 2022, but with\npassage of the IRA has been delayed by Congress until January 1, 2032.\n83\nTable of Contents\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available\nto individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug\ncoverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can\nbe negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and\nreplaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the HHS to implement many\nof these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.\nSpecifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic\nproducts that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs\npaid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and\nbeyond. This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to\ndrugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. On August 15, 2024, HHS published the results of the first Medicare drug price\nnegotiations for ten selected drugs that treat a range of conditions, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. The prices of these ten drugs will\nbecome effective January 1, 2026. On October 2, 2024, in final guidance, CMS indicated that it will announce the selection of up to 15 additional drugs covered by Part\nD for the second cycle of negotiations by February 1, 2025. Nonetheless, since CMS may establish a maximum price for these products in price negotiations, we would\nbe fully at risk of government action if our products or those of our partners are the subject of Medicare price negotiations. Moreover, given the risk that could be the\ncase, these provisions of the IRA may also further heighten the risk that we would not be able to achieve the expected return on our drug products or full value of our\npatents protecting our products if prices are set after such products have been on the market for nine years.\nFurthermore, these provisions of the IRA may cause some companies to shift their research portfolio and priorities more towards large molecules (i.e.,\nbiologics such as antibodies) rather than small molecules. Although we do have applications of our technology to biologics, we do not yet have the same validation or\nvalue for large molecule discovery as we do for small molecule discovery. Accordingly, if the IRA causes the pharmaceutical industry to pivot investment and portfolio\nstrategy away from small molecule drug discovery and towards biologics, it could have a material adverse effect on the expected value of our drug discovery programs\nand also on the perceived value of using our software to develop product candidates. In addition, if investment levels and development interest in small molecule\ntherapeutics decreased, it may become more difficult for us to enter into collaborations on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, for our proprietary drug discovery\nprograms. If we are unable to find suitable collaborators and/or partners for our programs, we may be forced to fund and undertake development or commercialization\nactivities on our own for more programs than we would otherwise expect to, or plan for, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn June 6, 2023, Merck & Co., Inc., filed a lawsuit against HHS and CMS asserting that, among other things, the IRA’s Drug Price Negotiation Program for\nMedicare constitutes an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Subsequently, other parties, including the U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce and other pharmaceutical companies also filed lawsuits in various courts with similar constitutional claims against HHS and CMS. There have been various\ndecisions by the courts considering these cases since they were filed. HHS has generally won substantive disputes in these cases, and various federal district court\njudges have expressed skepticism regarding the merits of the legal arguments being pursued by the pharmaceutical industry. Certain of these cases are now on appeal,\nwith oral arguments held in October 2024. We expect that litigation involving these and other provisions of the IRA will continue, with unpredictable and uncertain\nresults.\n84\nTable of Contents\nFurther, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a\nprice that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires\nmanufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an\nestimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year. In addition, the IRA potentially raises legal risks with respect to individuals\nparticipating in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan who may experience a gap in coverage if they required coverage above their initial annual coverage limit\nbefore they reached the higher threshold, or “catastrophic period” of the plan. Individuals requiring services exceeding the initial annual coverage limit and below the\ncatastrophic period, must pay 100% of the cost of their prescriptions until they reach the catastrophic period. Among other things, the IRA contains many provisions\naimed at reducing this financial burden on individuals by reducing the co-insurance and co-payment costs, expanding eligibility for lower income subsidy plans, and\nprice caps on annual out-of-pocket expenses, each of which could have potential pricing and reporting implications.\nAccordingly, while it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, we cannot predict with certainty what impact any federal or state health reforms will\nhave on us, but such changes could impose new or more stringent regulatory requirements on our activities or result in reduced reimbursement for approved products,\nany of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and\nbiological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and\ntransparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare organizations\nand individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription\ndrug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We\nexpect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state\ngovernments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our product candidates, if\napproved. In markets outside of the United States and the European Union, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many\ncountries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In many countries, including those of the European Union, the pricing of prescription\npharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the\nreceipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a\nclinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. If reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing\nis set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nCompliance with global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data\nglobally, and the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework for the collection, use, safeguarding, sharing, transfer, and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is\nlikely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Globally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy\nframeworks with which we must comply. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the\nEuropean Union, including personal health data and employee data, is subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took\neffect across all member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA, in May 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on\ncompanies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the\npersonal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of\npersonal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR increases our obligations with\nrespect to any clinical trials conducted in the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent\npractices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to\ncountries outside the European Union, including the United\n85\nTable of Contents\nStates and, as a result, increases the scrutiny that such rules should apply to transfers of personal data from any clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States.\nIn October 2022, President Biden signed an executive order to implement the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which serves as a replacement to the EU-U.S. Privacy\nShield. The European Commission initiated the process to adopt an adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework in December 2022, and the European\nCommission adopted the adequacy decision on July 10, 2023. The adequacy decision permits companies in the United States who self-certify to the EU-U.S. Data\nPrivacy Framework to rely on it as a valid data transfer mechanism for data transfers from the European Union to the United States. However, some privacy advocacy\ngroups have already suggested that they will be challenging the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If these challenges are successful, they may not only impact the EU-\nU.S. Data Privacy Framework, but also further limit the viability of the standard contractual clauses and other data transfer mechanisms. The uncertainty around this\nissue has the potential to impact our business internationally.\nFollowing the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of\npersonal data that takes place in the United Kingdom and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by GDPR. In relation to data transfers, both the United Kingdom\nand the European Union have determined, through separate “adequacy” decisions, that data transfers between the two jurisdictions are in compliance with the United\nKingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR, respectively. In October 2023, the United Kingdom and the United States implemented a US-UK \"data bridge,\"\nwhich functions similarly to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and provides an additional legal mechanism for companies to transfer data from the United Kingdom\nto the United States. Any changes or updates to these developments have the potential to impact our business.\nThe GDPR also permits data protection authorities to require destruction of improperly gathered or used personal information and/or impose substantial fines\nfor violations of the GDPR, which can be up to four percent of global revenues or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and confers a private right of action on data\nsubjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from\nviolations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR provides that European Union member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of\npersonal data, including genetic, biometric, or health data.\nGiven the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing for and complying with the GDPR’s requirements is rigorous and time\nintensive and requires significant resources and a review of our technologies, systems and practices, as well as those of any third-party collaborators, service providers,\ncontractors, or consultants that process or transfer personal data collected in the European Union. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with\nthe enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information, could require us to change our business practices and\nput in place additional compliance mechanisms, may interrupt or delay our development, regulatory and commercialization activities and increase our cost of doing\nbusiness, and could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation, and significant fines and penalties against us, and could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nSimilar privacy and data security requirements are either in place or underway in the United States. There are a broad variety of data protection laws that may\nbe applicable to our activities, and a range of enforcement agencies at both the state and federal levels that can review companies for privacy and data security concerns.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and state Attorneys General are aggressive in reviewing privacy and data security protections for consumers. For example, the\nFTC has been particularly focused on the unpermitted processing of health and genetic data through its recent enforcement actions and is expanding the types of privacy\nviolations that it interprets to be “unfair” under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as well as the types of activities it views to trigger the Health Breach\nNotification Rule (which the FTC also has the authority to enforce). The agency is also in the process of developing rules related to commercial surveillance and data\nsecurity that may impact our business. We will need to account for the FTC’s evolving rules and guidance for proper privacy and data security practices in order to\nmitigate our risk for a potential enforcement action, which may be costly. If we are subject to a potential FTC enforcement action, we may be subject to a settlement\norder that requires us to adhere to very specific privacy and data security practices, which may impact our business. We may also be required to pay fines as part of a\nsettlement (depending on the nature of the alleged violations). If we violate any consent order that we reach with the FTC, we may be subject to additional fines and\ncompliance requirements.\n86\nTable of Contents\nStates are also active in creating specific rules relating to the processing of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA,\nwhich went into effect on January 1, 2020, is creating similar risks and obligations as those created by GDPR. Because of this, we may need to engage in additional\nactivities (e.g., data mapping) to identify the personal information we are collecting and the purposes for which such information is collected. In addition, we will need\nto ensure that our policies recognize the rights granted to consumers (as that phrase is broadly defined in the CCPA and can include business contact information),\nincluding granting consumers the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. Many other states are considering similar legislation. In November 2020,\nCalifornia voters passed a ballot initiative for the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023 and significantly expanded the\nCCPA to incorporate additional GDPR-like provisions including requiring that the use, retention, and sharing of personal information of California residents be\nreasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes of collection or processing, granting additional protections for sensitive personal information, and requiring\ngreater disclosures related to notice to residents regarding retention of information. In addition to California, a number of other states have passed comprehensive\nprivacy laws similar to the CCPA and CPRA. These laws are either in effect or will go into effect sometime over the next few years. Like the CCPA and CPRA, these\nlaws create obligations related to the processing of personal information, as well as special obligations for the processing of “sensitive” data (which includes health data\nin some cases). Some of the provisions of these laws may apply to our business activities. There are also states that are strongly considering privacy laws that will go\ninto effect in 2025 and beyond. Other states will be considering these laws in the future, and at the same time, a broad range of legislative measures also have been\nintroduced at the federal level. Accordingly, failure to comply with current and any future federal and state laws regarding privacy and security of personal information\ncould expose us to fines and penalties. We also face the threat of consumer class actions related to these laws and the overall protection of personal data. Plaintiffs’\nlawyers are also increasingly using privacy-related statutes at both the state and federal level to bring lawsuits against companies for their data-related practices. In\nparticular, there have been a significant number of cases filed against companies for their use of pixels and other web trackers. These cases often allege violations of the\nCalifornia Invasion of Privacy Act and other state laws regulating wiretapping, as well as the federal Video Privacy Protection Act. The rise in these types of lawsuits\ncould create potential risk for our business.\nEven if we are not determined to have violated these laws, investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and\ngenerate negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nWe, and the collaborators who use our computational platform, may be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health\ninformation privacy and security, and other healthcare laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, may result in substantial penalties.\nWe, and the collaborators who use our computational platform, may be subject to broadly applicable healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the\nbusiness or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, and distribute our software solutions and any products for which we obtain\nmarketing approval. Such healthcare laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the federal health care Anti-Kickback Statute; federal civil and criminal false\nclaims laws, such as the federal False Claims Act; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA; the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act; the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act; and analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and\ntransparency laws.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It\nis possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving\napplicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. Violations of applicable healthcare laws and regulations may result in significant civil, criminal, and\nadministrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and\nMedicaid, additional reporting requirements, and/or oversight if a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement is executed to resolve allegations of non-\ncompliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. In addition, violations may also result in reputational harm, diminished profits, and future\nearnings.\n87\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws, and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply\nwith these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, be precluded from developing, manufacturing, and\nselling certain products outside the United States or be required to develop and implement costly compliance programs, which could adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and\nother anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future. The Bribery Act, FCPA, and these other laws generally\nprohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed, or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons\nto obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Compliance with the FCPA, in particular, is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which\ncorruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the biopharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are\noperated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials\nand other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nWe may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we may participate in collaborations and\nrelationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA, or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot\npredict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might\nbe administered or interpreted. If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous\nlaws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United\nKingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons,\ncustoms requirements, and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. In addition, various laws, regulations, and executive orders\nalso restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security\npurposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate\nadditional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates\noutside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the\nFCPA, or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws or Trade\nControl laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, also may suspend or\nbar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions. Any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery\nAct, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by the United Kingdom, U.S., or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation,\nour business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with\nregulatory standards and requirements and insider trading laws, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, and vendors. Misconduct by these partners\ncould include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and\nregulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately, or\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could\nresult in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. This could include violations of HIPAA, other U.S. federal and state law, and requirements of non-U.S.\njurisdictions, including the European Union Data Protection Directive. We are also exposed to\n88\nTable of Contents\nrisks in connection with any insider trading violations by employees or others affiliated with us. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and\nthe precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from\ngovernmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards, regulations, guidance, or codes of\nconduct. Furthermore, our employees may, from time to time, bring lawsuits against us for employment issues, including injury, discrimination, wage and hour disputes,\nsexual harassment, hostile work environment, or other employment issues. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves\nor asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other\nsanctions.\nOur internal information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, contractors, or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, loss or leakage of\ndata, and other disruptions, which could result in a material disruption of our services, compromise sensitive information related to our business, or prevent us\nfrom accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we\ncollect, store, and transmit confidential information (including but not limited to intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information). It is\ncritical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced elements of our\noperations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants who have access to our confidential\ninformation.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, given the size and complexity of our internal information technology systems and those of our third-party\nvendors and other contractors and consultants, and the increasing amounts of confidential information that they maintain, our information technology systems are\npotentially vulnerable to breakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions, system malfunction, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and\ntelecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors, contractors,\nconsultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware,\ndenial-of-service attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information),\nwhich may compromise our system infrastructure, or that of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants or lead to data leakage. The risk of a security\nbreach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally\nincreased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. We may not be able to anticipate all\ntypes of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. For example, third parties have in the past\nand may in the future illegally pirate our software and make that software publicly available on peer-to-peer file sharing networks or otherwise. The techniques used by\ncyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external\nservice providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were\nto result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or inappropriate disclosure of\nconfidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and reputational damage and the further development and commercialization of our software could be\ndelayed. The costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material and exceed the limits of the cybersecurity insurance we maintain against such\nrisks. If the information technology systems of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may\nhave insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and\nimplement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.\nWhile we have not experienced any significant system failure, accident, or security breach to date, and believe that our data protection efforts and our\ninvestment in information technology reduce the likelihood of such incidents in the future, we cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment in\ninformation technology will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in our systems, or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and\nconsultants, or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations, or financial condition. For example, if such an\nevent were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, it could result in a material\ndisruption of our programs and the development of our services and technologies could be delayed. Furthermore, significant disruptions of our internal information\ntechnology systems or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or security\n89\nTable of Contents\nbreaches could result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including\ntrade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information), which could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational\nharm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our\ncustomers or employees, could harm our reputation directly, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject\nus to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which\ncould result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Further, sophisticated\ncyber attackers (including foreign adversaries engaged in industrial espionage) are skilled at adapting to existing security technology and developing new methods of\ngaining access to organizations’ sensitive business data, which could result in the loss of sensitive information, including trade secrets. For example, attackers have used\nartificial intelligence and machine learning to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks against targets. Additionally, actual, potential, or anticipated\nattacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party\nexperts and consultants.\nClimate change-related risks and uncertainties and legal or regulatory responses to climate change could negatively impact our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, prospects and reputation.\nWe are subject to increasing climate-related risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Climate change may result in more frequent\nsevere weather events, potential changes in precipitation patterns, and extreme variability in weather patterns, which can disrupt our operations as well as those of our\nvendors, suppliers, and collaborators.\nClimate-related macroeconomic trends, including the transition to a lower carbon economy, the effects of carbon pricing, changes in public sentiment, and the\npotential enactment of climate-related rules and regulations, continue to evolve and may increase our legal, compliance and business costs. Further, increases in climate-\nrelated litigation instituted against companies, the cost of climate-related insurance premiums, and the implementation of a more robust business continuity plan and a\ndisaster recovery plan could increase the costs necessary to maintain our operations or achieve any sustainability commitments we may make, which could harm our\nbusiness.\nWe annually assess the impacts of our operations and of our customers on the climate. The execution and achievement of any future commitments that we may\nmake or of any goals that we may set relating to climate change are subject to risks and uncertainties. Given the focus on sustainable investing and corporate\nsustainability, if we fail to adopt policies and practices to enhance environmental initiatives, our reputation and our customer and stakeholder relationships could be\nnegatively impacted, which may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or to gain access to financing on acceptable terms when needed, which would\nnegatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and reputation.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical, financial, operational, scientific, software engineering, and other business expertise of our\nexecutive officers, as well as the other principal members of our management, scientific, clinical, and software engineering teams. Although we have entered into\nemployment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain “key person” insurance for\nany of our executives or other employees.\nThe loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our development and sales goals in our software\nbusiness and the achievement of our research, development, and commercialization objectives in our drug discovery business. In either case, the loss of the services of\nour executive officers or other key employees could seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive\nofficers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals with the breadth of skills and\nexperience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of, and commercialize products in the life sciences industry.\n90\nTable of Contents\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, accounting, legal, and sales and marketing personnel, as well as software engineers and\ncomputational chemists, will also be critical to our success. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of\nexpertise in designing, developing, and managing software and related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists, and operations personnel.\nCompetition to hire these individuals is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain, or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition\namong numerous biopharmaceutical and technology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel\nfrom universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development and\ncommercialization strategy and advancing our computational platform. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have\ncommitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high\nquality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe are pursuing multiple business strategies and expect to expand our development and regulatory capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in\nmanaging our multiple business units and our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nCurrently, we are pursuing multiple business strategies simultaneously, including activities in research and development, software sales, and collaborative and\nproprietary drug discovery. We believe pursuing these multiple business strategies offers financial and operational synergies, but these diversified operations place\nincreased demands on our limited resources. Furthermore, we have recently experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, significant growth in the number of\nour employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, clinical and regulatory affairs. To manage our multiple business units and\nour ongoing and anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities, and\ncontinue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and our management team’s limited attention and limited experience\nin managing a company with such ongoing and anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage our multiple business units and the expansion of our\noperations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations has led to and may continue to lead to significant costs and may divert our\nmanagement and business development resources. Our management, personnel, and systems may not be adequate to support this future growth. Any inability to manage\nour multiple business units and growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations and the synergies we believe currently exist between\nour business units. In addition, adverse developments in one of these business units may disrupt these synergies.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nOur shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on February 6, 2020. Prior to February 6, 2020, there was no public market for\nour common stock, and we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our shares will be sustained. As a result, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell\ntheir shares without depressing the market price of our common stock, or at all.\nOur executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, have the ability to influence all matters submitted to stockholders for\napproval.\nAs of November 5, 2024, our executive officers and directors and our stockholders who beneficially owned more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, in\nthe aggregate, beneficially owned shares representing approximately 37.7% of our common stock and all of our limited common stock, or, if the holder of our limited\ncommon stock exercised its right to convert each share of its limited common stock for one share of our common stock, approximately 45.6% of our common stock. As\na result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our\nmanagement and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation,\nor sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nThis concentration of ownership control may:\n• delay, defer, or prevent a change in control;\n• entrench our management and board of directors; or\n91\nTable of Contents\n• delay or prevent a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may desire.\nThis concentration of ownership may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock is volatile and fluctuates substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nOur stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since our initial public offering in February 2020 and through November 5, 2024, the intraday\nprice of our common stock has fluctuated from a low of $15.85 to a high of $117.00. As a result of volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common\nstock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n• our investment in, and the success of, our software solutions;\n• the success of our research and development efforts for our proprietary drug discovery programs;\n• initiation and progress of preclinical studies and clinical trials for any product candidates that we may develop;\n• results of or developments in preclinical studies and clinical trials of any product candidates we may develop or those of our competitors or potential\ncollaborators;\n• the success of our drug discovery collaborators and any milestone or other payments we receive from such collaborators;\n• the success of competitive products or technologies;\n• regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n• the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n• variations in our financial results or the financial results of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n• guidance or announcements by us with respect to our anticipated financial or operational performance;\n• sales of common stock by us, our executive officers, directors or principal stockholders, or others, or the anticipation of such sales;\n• equity or debt financing;\n• market conditions in the biopharmaceutical sector;\n• general economic, industry, and market conditions;\n• the societal and economic impact of public health epidemics, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic; and\n• the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that\ncompany. Any lawsuit to which we are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable\nterms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation, or adverse changes to our offerings or business\npractices. Such litigation may also cause us to incur other substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management’s attention and resources.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nWe have released, and may in the future release, guidance in our annual or quarterly earnings conference calls, annual or quarterly earnings releases, or\notherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of such guidance. Our guidance, which includes forward-\nlooking statements, is based on projections prepared by our management. Neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party\ncompiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\n92\nTable of Contents\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant\nbusiness, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to\nfuture business decisions, some of which will change. The principal reason that we have released, and would continue to release, guidance is to provide a basis for our\nmanagement to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such\nthird parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying any guidance furnished by us will not\nmaterialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of\nrelease. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material.\nWe and our collaborators may not achieve projected discovery and development milestones and other anticipated key events in the time frames that we or they\nannounce, which could have an adverse impact on our business and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFrom time to time, we expect that we will make public statements regarding the expected timing of certain milestones and key events, such as the\ncommencement and completion of preclinical and IND-enabling studies and clinical trials in our proprietary drug discovery programs as well as developments and\nmilestones under our collaborations. For example, Morphic Holding, Inc. and Structure Therapeutics have also made public statements regarding their expectations\nfor the development of programs under collaboration with us and they and other collaborators may in the future make additional statements about their goals and\nexpectations for collaborations with us. The actual timing of these events can vary dramatically due to a number of factors such as delays or failures in our or our\ncurrent and future collaborators’ drug discovery and development programs, the amount of time, effort, and resources committed by us and our current and future\ncollaborators, and the numerous uncertainties inherent in the development of drugs. As a result, there can be no assurance that our or our current and future\ncollaborators’ programs will advance or be completed in the time frames we or they announce or expect. If we or any collaborators fail to achieve one or more of\nthese milestones or other key events as planned, our business could be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock could decline.\nIf securities analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports or publish misleading, inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if\nthey publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price and trading volume of our stock could decline.\nThe market price and trading volume for our common stock relies, in part, on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or\nour business. We do not have control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that existing analysts will continue to cover us or that new analysts will begin to\ncover us. There is also no assurance that any covering analyst will provide favorable coverage. Although we have obtained analyst coverage, if one or more of the\nanalysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, or provides more favorable\nrelative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose\nvisibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion in the deployment and use of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and could use such funds in ways\nthat do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock or in ways that our stockholders may not agree with. The failure by our\nmanagement to apply these funds effectively could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and could cause the price of our\ncommon stock to decline.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of\ngain for our stockholders.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings to fund the development and\nexpansion of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future\n93\nTable of Contents\nwill be at the discretion of our board of directors. As a result, capital appreciation of our common stock, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for\nthe foreseeable future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if\nour business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares\nintend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock, impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities, and make it\nmore difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock at a time and price that they deem appropriate. As of November 5, 2024, we had outstanding 63,694,574\nshares of common stock and 9,164,193 shares of limited common stock. All of our outstanding shares of common stock, including shares of common stock issuable\nupon the conversion of shares of our limited common stock, are available for sale in the public market, subject only to the restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities\nAct of 1933, as amended, in the case of our affiliates. In addition, certain of our executive officers, directors and affiliated stockholders have entered or may enter into\nRule 10b5-1 plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time. Under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters\nestablished by the executive officer, director or affiliated stockholder when entering into the plan, without further direction from the executive officer, director or\naffiliated stockholder. A Rule 10b5-1 plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances. Our executive officers, directors and affiliated stockholders also may\nbuy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material, nonpublic information.\nWe have also filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which allows us to offer and sell an indeterminate number of shares of common stock,\npreferred stock, depositary shares or warrants, or an indeterminate principal amount of debt securities, from time to time pursuant to one or more offerings at prices and\nterms to be determined at the time of the sale. Moreover, certain holders of our common stock and our limited common stock have rights, subject to specified\nconditions, to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders and may require us to file Form S-3 registration\nstatements covering their shares.\nWe are party to an amended and restated sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (formerly SVB Securities LLC), or Leerink Partners, as sales agent, with\nrespect to an \"at the market\" offering program, or the ATM, under which we could offer and sell, from time to time pursuant to our Form S-3, shares of our common\nstock having an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million, through Leerink Partners. The number of shares that are sold by Leerink Partners after we request that\nsales be made will fluctuate based on the market price of our common stock during the sales period and limits we set with Leerink Partners. Therefore, it is not possible\nto predict the number of shares that will be ultimately issued by us, if any, pursuant to the amended and restated sales agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we have\nsold 323,085 shares of common stock for total net proceeds of $8.7 million, and have $241.1 million of common stock remaining available for sale under the ATM.\nWe also have filed registration statements on Form S-8 to register shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. Shares\nregistered under such registration statements are available for sale in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates, vesting\narrangements and exercise of options.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management has devoted and will continue to be\nrequired to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment\nand maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote and will need to\ncontinue to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to these compliance initiatives, potentially at the expense of other business concerns, which could harm\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal and\nfinancial compliance costs, and have made and will continue to make some activities more time-consuming and costly compared to when we were a private company.\n94\nTable of Contents\nWe frequently evaluate our compliance with these rules and regulations, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the\ntiming of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their\napplication in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding\ncompliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain the adequacy\nof these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting on\nan annual basis. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nPursuant to Section 404, we are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting on an annual basis.\nDuring our evaluation of our internal control, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable\nto assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, if we have an unremediated material weakness, we would receive an adverse opinion\nregarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. For example, in connection with the audit of our\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our\ninternal control over financial reporting. While we remediated this material weakness as of December 31, 2023, we cannot assure you that there will not be material\nweaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. If in the future we again identify a material weakness, we cannot\nassure you that any measures we may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate such material weakness or avoid the identification of additional material\nweaknesses in the future. If the steps we take do not remediate a future material weakness in a timely manner, there could be a reasonable possibility that this control\ndeficiency or others could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAny failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, or results of\noperations. If we are unable to conclude in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public\naccounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and\ncompleteness of our financial reports, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition\nto applicable stock exchange listing requirements, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations\nby Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or\nmaintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nAs a public company, we are subject to certain reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably\nassure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded,\nprocessed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or\ninternal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error\nor mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the\ncontrols. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be\ndetected.\n95\nTable of Contents\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders,\nmore difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current directors and members of management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control of our company\nthat stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also\nlimit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition,\nbecause our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our\nstockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other\nthings, these provisions:\n• establish a classified board of directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;\n• allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n• limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from our board of directors;\n• establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n• require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n• limit who may call stockholder meetings to the board of directors or to the secretary at the request of the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding\nshares of our common stock and limited common stock; and\n• authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a “poison pill” that would work to\ndilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the\nDGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the\ndate of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed\nmanner.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that\nmay be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors, officers, and employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and\nexclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our\ndirectors, officers, employees or stockholders to our company or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or as\nto which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (4) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of our\ncertificate of incorporation or bylaws (in each case, as they may be amended from time to time) or governed by the internal affairs doctrine. These choice of forum\nprovisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which\nfederal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes\nwith us or our directors, officers, or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees. Alternatively, if a court were\nto find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs\nassociated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n96\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

With respect to contracts that have a duration of one year or less, or\ncontracts of more than one year in duration that are billed annually, ACV is defined as the contract value\nbilled during the applicable period. For contracts with a duration of more than one year that are billed upfront,\nACV in each period represents the total billed contract value divided by the term. ACV should be viewed\nindependently of revenue and does not represent revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP on an\nannualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract execution start and end dates\nand renewal rates. ACV is not intended to be a replacement for, or forecast of, revenue.\nCustomer Retention for our customers with an ACV of at least $500,000. We calculate year-over-year\ncustomer retention for our customers in this cohort by starting with the number of such customers we had in\nthe previous fiscal year. We then calculate how many of these customers were active customers in the\ncurrent fiscal year. We then divide this number by the number of customers with an ACV of at least $500,000\nthat Schrödinger had in the previous fiscal year to arrive at the year-over-year customer retention rate for\nsuch customers.\n42"
