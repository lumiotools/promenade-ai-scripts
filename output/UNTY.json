The stations can accommodate up to four vehicles and are part of the Lynkwell charging network. EV drivers are invited to enjoy complimentary beverages from the Unity Bank café during business hours while their vehicles charge. Employees and customers of the bank will also benefit from a special discount on charging fees.\n\n“This significant enhancement not only supports our commitment to sustainability but also directly benefits those utilizing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) or fully electric vehicles,” said James Hughes, President & CEO of Unity Bank. “This integration of renewable energy sources is a testament to our innovative approach.”\n\nUnity Bank collaborated with Encore Energy Group, a leading provider in commercial EV infrastructure, to install the charging stations. These Lynkwell DCFC chargers provide fast charging capabilities, offering four plugs and 60kW DC fast charging, allowing multiple vehicles to be charged simultaneously.\n\n“This is an investment not only for Unity Bank as a company but also for our employees, customers, and community members,” Hughes added. “We hope that by offering access to EV charging, more individuals will consider switching to electric vehicles and contribute to a more sustainable future.”\n\nThe new EV charging stations at Unity Bank’s headquarters, located at 64 Old Highway 22 in Clinton, NJ, are now fully operational and ready to serve the community.\n\n**About Unity Bancorp, Inc.**\n\nUnity Bancorp, Inc.
