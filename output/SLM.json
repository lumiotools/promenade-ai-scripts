We calculate the percentage of loans in an extended grace period as the ratio of (a) Private Education Loans in forbearance in an extended grace period numerator to (b) Private Education\nLoans in repayment and forbearance denominator. An extended grace period aligns with The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency definition of an additional, consecutive, one-time\nperiod during which no payment is required for up to six months after the initial grace period. We typically grant this extended grace period to customers who may be having difficulty finding\nemployment before the full principal and interest repayment period starts or once it has begun.\n2. We calculate the percentage of loans in hardship and other forbearances as the ratio of (a) Private Education Loans in hardship and other forbearances (excluding loans in an extended grace\nperiod) numerator to (b) Private Education Loans in repayment and forbearance denominator. If the customer is in financial hardship, we work with the customer and/or cosigner and identify\nany available alternative arrangements designed to reduce monthly payment obligations, which may include a short-term hardship forbearance.\n3.

For Private Education Loans on this slide, “loans in repayment” include loans making interest only or fixed payments, as well as loans that have entered full principal and interest repayment\nstatus after any applicable grace period (but do not include those loans while they are in forbearance).\n18. For Private Education Loans on this slide, “loans in forbearance” include loans for customers who have requested extension of grace period generally during employment transition or who\nhave temporarily ceased making full payments due to hardship or other factors, consistent with established loan program servicing policies and procedures.\n19. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due.\n20.
