(NASDAQ: CYCC, NASDAQ: CYCCP; \"Cyclacel\" or the \"Company\"), a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative cancer medicines, today announced that it closed its previously announced transaction involving the exercise of certain existing warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,968,945 shares of its common stock having an original exercise price of $1.36 per share, originally issued in May 2024, at a reduced exercise price of $0.415 per share. The resale of the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the existing warrants is registered pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-279157).\n\nH.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.\n\nIn consideration for the immediate exercise of the existing warrants for cash, the Company issued new unregistered Series C warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 9,937,890 shares of common stock and new unregistered Series D warrants to purchase up to 9,937,890 shares of common stock. The new warrants have an exercise price of $0.415 per share and will be exercisable commencing on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares issuable upon the exercise of the new warrants (the “Stockholder Approval”). The new Series C warrants have a term of five and one-half years from the Stockholder Approval, and the new Series D warrants have a term of eighteen months from the Stockholder Approval.\n\nThe gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $2.1 million, prior to deducting placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n\nThe new warrants described above were offered in a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder and, along with the shares of common stock underlying the new warrants, have not been registered under the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the new warrants and shares of common stock underlying the new warrants may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws. The Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the new warrants.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\n\n**About Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nCyclacel is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing innovative cancer medicines based on cell cycle, transcriptional regulation and mitosis biology. The transcriptional regulation program is evaluating fadraciclib, a CDK2/9 inhibitor, and the anti-mitotic program plogosertib, a PLK1 inhibitor, in patients with both solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

(NASDAQ: CYCC, NASDAQ: CYCCP; \"Cyclacel\" or the \"Company\"), a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative medicines, today announced third quarter financial results and provided a business update.\n\n“We were pleased to report initial safety and efficacy data from twelve patients with advanced solid tumors enrolled in the Phase 2 part of the 065-101, proof of concept, clinical study of fadraciclib as a single agent as a poster presentation at the 2024 EORTC-NCI-AACR 36th Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (“Triple Meeting”), in Barcelona, Spain. The patients were enrolled in the biomarker-enriched, Cohort 8 of the study and were preselected for CDKN2A and/or CDKN2B abnormalities,” said Spiro Rombotis, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Nasdaq has granted the Company an extension until December 24, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum stockholders’ equity requirement and we continue to pursue opportunities to obtain additional funding for our programs. If we do not secure such additional funding in an amount that allows us to meet or exceed Nasdaq’s minimum stockholders’ equity requirement, our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq.”\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash equivalents totaled $3.0 million, compared to $3.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities was $6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.2 million for the same period of 2023. The Company estimates that its available cash will fund currently planned programs into the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nAlthough the Company has made substantial reductions in its expenses, there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently investigating ways to raise additional capital through private equity financing or by entering into a strategic transaction. In the event that we are not able to secure such additional funding, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop ongoing development activities, cease operations altogether, and/or file for bankruptcy. In such events, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in the Company.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $5.2 million for the same period in 2023. R&D expenses relating to fadraciclib were $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $3.6 million for the same period in 2023 due to manufacturing costs not recurring in 2024. R&D expenses related to plogosertib were $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2023 also due to manufacturing costs not recurring in 2024.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.2 million, as compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2023 due largely to reduction in stock compensation costs. \n\nTotal other income, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $10,000 compared to an income of $145,000 for the same period of the previous year.\n\nUnited Kingdom research & development tax credits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $0.2 million compared to $0.7 million for the same period of the previous year. Research & development tax credits are directly correlated to qualifying research and development expenditure.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.0 million, compared to $6.0 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n**About Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nCyclacel is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing innovative cancer medicines based on cell cycle, transcriptional regulation and mitosis biology.
