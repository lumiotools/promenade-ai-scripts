(the “Company,” “Newegg,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) includes \"forward-looking statements\" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or to our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our\nactual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking\nstatements. These statements include statements or assumptions about our plans, strategies, financial performance, financing plans, prospects, capital structure, cash flow, liquidity, goals and objectives for\nfuture operations, growth or future events. As a result, our actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These\nstatements may be identified by the use of words like \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"plan\", \"will\", \"should\", \"seek\" and similar expressions and include any projections or\nestimates set forth herein. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Company and its management team, are inherently\nuncertain. A more complete description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company’s filings with the SEC available for free at www.sec.gov. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any\nforward-looking statements, which are made as of the date of this presentation. We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, new information or future\nevents, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable laws. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no\ninference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\nThis presentation contains financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepting accounting principles (“GAAP”) that have been extracted without material adjustment from audited GAAP\nfinancial statements and/or extracted or derived from unaudited accounting records that have been used to prepare GAAP financial statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures which have not been and will not be audited. These non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP, but are measures used by Newegg’s\nmanagement to monitor the underlying performance of Newegg’s business and operations. These non-GAAP measures may not be indicative of Newegg’s historical operating results nor are such measures meant\nto be predicative of future results. These measures and ratios may not be comparable to those used by other companies under the same or similar names. As such, undue reliance should not be placed on these\nnon-GAAP financial measures. Certain financial information contained herein is unaudited and is based on internal records and/or estimates.\nMarket and competitive position data in this document has generally been obtained from industry publications and surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources. There are limitations with respect to the\navailability, accuracy, completeness and comparability of such data. The Company has prepared this presentation based on information available to it, including information derived from public sources that have\nnot been independently verified, and no assurance can be given of its accuracy or completeness. Certain statements in this document regarding the market and competitive position data are based on the\ninternal analyses of the Company, which involve certain assumptions and estimates.

We temporarily experienced excessinventory levels, but were able to quickly correct the issues and maintain healthy inventory levels to achieve break-even Adjusted\nEBITDA in 2022.\n2023 inflation, demand remained slow due to overall economy, inflation, and high interest rates. Management team took swift actions to right-size the company\nthrough cost reductions.\no Comparing full-year 2019 to 2023:\n▪ GMV is expected decline 8.8%, mostly driven by declines in our marketplace business.\n▪ Gross margin %is projected toincrease by 1.0%; gross margin dollars projected to increase by$2.7M\n▪ Additionally, we streamlined business processes and optimized headcount to create a projected reduction of $18.4M in comp and benefit expense.\n▪ We reduced external marketing expenses by 50% and brought marketing efforts in-house by establishing Newegg Media.\n▪ We focused on higher margin service revenue in fourth quarter of 2023, which we expect will continue into 2024.\n▪ At the same time, weconsolidated warehouse locations and implemented robotic picking process with Geek+. This resulted in approximately $600K of savings per month and is\nexpected to result in a projected annual savings of approximately $7.2M in 2024.\n20\n2023 Full Year Guidance\nThe Company previously issued the following guidance on December 22, 2023:\n• GMV to be between $1.78 billion to $1.83 billion\n• Net Sales to be between $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion\n• Gross Profit to be between $160.0 million to $165.0 million\n• Net loss to be between $56.0 million and $60.0 million\n• Adjusted EBITDA to be between $(21.0) million and $(25.0) million\n21"

Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by\nthe fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

These statements are likely to address our growth strategy, financial results and product and\ndevelopment programs. You must carefully consider any such statements and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to\ndiffer from our forward-looking statements. These factors may include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties,\nincluding some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary\nmaterially.

We caution you that actual outcomes and results may, and are likely to, differ materially from\nwhat is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should be careful about relying on any forward-looking\nstatements.

shares pledged as collateral to support delinquent indebtedness of our parent company;\n● the extreme volatility of the market price of our common shares due to numerous circumstances beyond our control;\n● Mr. Zhitao He (as the Chairman and CEO of Hangzhou Lianluo, and in his own capacity) and Mr. Fred Chang’s approximate 58.7% and\n32.9% control, respectively, and 91.6%, collectively, of

impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our common shares;\n● any shareholder litigation due to the volatility in the price of our common shares, which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of\nour management’s attention and resources;\n● our failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, which may lead to us being delisted from Nasdaq, which would result in a\nlimited public market for trading our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult;\n3\n● any involvement of our directors and officers in investigations or other forms of regulatory or governmental inquiry which may cause\nreputational harm to the Company, result in additional expenses, and distract our management from our day-to-day operations;\n● securities or

the market price of our common shares;\n● difficulty enforcing judgments against us, our directors and management;\n● unavailability of certain types of class or derivative actions under British Virgin Islands law and other interests under U.S. law;\n● protecting shareholder interests that would otherwise be normally available to shareholders of a U.S. corporation;\n● our expectation not to pay dividends in the foreseeable future;\n● certain home country (British Virgin Islands) practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from Nasdaq’s\ncorporate governance listing standards, which may afford less protection to shareholders; and\n● our foreign private issuer status, which exempts us from certain reporting requirements applicable to U.S. domestic public companies.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions and the effect of economic pressures and other business factors on discretionary consumer spending and\nconsumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertainties in global macroeconomic conditions that are beyond our control have in the past impacted our business and may in the future\nmaterially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. These adverse economic conditions include\ninflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other changes to fiscal and monetary policy, higher interest rates, high\nunemployment, decreased consumer confidence in the economy, armed hostilities, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, conditions affecting\nthe retail environment for products we sell, and other matters that influence consumer spending and preferences.\nIn addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial\nnews, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, including home equity loans and consumer credit, changes in net worth based on market\nchanges and uncertainty, energy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs, government actions and general uncertainty regarding the\noverall future economic environment. Some consumers view a substantial portion of the products we offer as discretionary items rather than\nnecessities. As a result, our operating results are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending, including\ndiscretionary spending. Declines in consumer spending have resulted, and in the future may result, in decreased demand for our products and\nservices which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n4\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to financial instability; increased credit and collectability risk on our receivables; the failure\nof important partners, including suppliers, logistics providers, and financial institutions; limitations on our ability to issue new debt; reduced\nliquidity and declines in the fair value of our financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOur business faces intense domestic and international competition.\nThe e-commerce market is intensely competitive with limited barriers to entry. Our current and potential competitors include retailers,\nmanufacturers and distributors that offer a wide range of similar product categories and companies that provide Direct-to-Consumer (“D2C”)\nplatform services, fulfillment and logistics services and other e-commerce related services. It is expected that the competition in this market will\nintensify in the future as companies develop new business models and enhanced technologies, new competitors enter the market, competitors forge\nnew business combinations or alliances, and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business.\nMany of our current and potential online and brick-and-mortar competitors have larger bases of customers or third-party sellers, better brand\nrecognition and greater financial, marketing, technical, management and other resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors have used\nand may continue to use aggressive pricing or promotional strategies, may have stronger supplier relationships with more favorable terms and\ninventory allocation and may devote substantially greater resources to their online platforms and system development than we do. Increased\ncompetition may result in reduced operating margins, reduced profitability, loss of market share and diminished brand recognition for Newegg.\nWe compete with online retailers such as Amazon and traditional retailers like Best Buy and Walmart, who sell through brick-and-mortar stores and\ntheir online websites. In addition, we also face competition in the international markets in which we participate or may enter in the future. Certain\nother competitors in countries where we operate are subsidiaries of e-commerce competitors in the United States with established local operations\nand brands and with greater experience and resources than we have. In other countries that we may enter, there may be incumbent online and multi-\nchannel online or brick-and-mortar competitors presently selling Information Technology/Consumer Electronic (“IT/CE”) products. These\nincumbents may have advantages that could impede our expansion and growth in these markets.\nWe could also experience significant competitive pressure if any of our manufacturers or distributors were to initiate or expand their own online or\nbrick-and-mortar retail operations. Because our manufacturers and distributors have access to merchandise at a lower cost than we do, they could\nsell products at lower prices and maintain a higher gross margin on their product sales than we can, and they may have the ability to directly\nconnect with buyers at relatively low cost. This could result in our current and potential buyers deciding to purchase directly from these\nmanufacturers and distributors instead of from Newegg. Increased competition from any manufacturer or distributor capable of maintaining high\nsales volumes and acquiring products at lower prices than we can, could significantly reduce our market share and adversely impact our operating\nresults.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Competitive pressures may materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in demand for IT/CE products could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe and our Marketplace sellers primarily sell IT/CE products that are often discretionary purchases rather than necessities for consumers.\nConsequently, our results of operations tend to be sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions and their impact on consumer spending.\nFactors including customer confidence, employment levels, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, access to credit, interest\nrates, tax rates, customer debt levels and fuel and energy costs could reduce customer spending or change customer purchasing habits in ways that\nmaterially and adversely affect demand for the products that we and our Marketplace sellers offer.\n5\nThere could be declines in the sales of the products offered by us and our Marketplace sellers due to several factors, including:\n● decreased demand for IT/CE products, particularly computer components and parts that have historically generated a significant portion of\nour net sales;\n● poor economic conditions and any related decline in customers’ demand for the products we and our Marketplace sellers offer;\n● increased price competition from our competitors; or\n● technological obsolescence of the products that we and our Marketplace sellers offer.\nAdditionally, it is expected that some of our future growth should be driven by product releases or upgrades that may occur in the near future. If\nsuch product releases do not occur or do not drive sales of IT/CE products to the extent expected, our future sales may be less than predicted,\nnegatively impacting our net sales and net income.\nNewegg’s reputation and business may be harmed if Newegg or the Newegg Marketplace sellers sell pirated, counterfeit, illegal or “gray\nmarket” items.\nWe receive from time to time, and may receive in the future, communications alleging that Newegg or the Newegg Marketplace sellers sold pirated,\ncounterfeit, illegal or “gray market” items. These and future claims could increase our cost of doing business as a result of legal expenses, adverse\njudgments or settlements, and reputational harm, and could require us to change our business practices in a way that would be less efficient and\nmore costly. In addition, key manufacturers and vendors, for instance, may be less likely to offer us favorable terms or authorization to carry their\nproducts if we sell products of theirs purchased on the “gray market.” We currently do not have any insurance to cover the types of claims that could\nbe asserted in such litigation or in legal or administrative actions initiated by customers of such products, or by government agencies. If a claim\nwere brought against us successfully, it could expose us to significant liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and\noperations.\nIf we are unable to provide a satisfactory customer experience, our reputation would be harmed and we could lose customers.\nThe success of our business depends largely on our ability to provide a superior customer experience to maintain and grow our customer base and\nkeep our customers highly engaged on our online platforms, which in turn depends on a variety of factors. These include our ability to continue to\nmaintain a wide range of product offerings with attractive pricing, provide timely and reliable order fulfillment and provide high-quality customer\nsupport and service. If our customers are not satisfied with our platforms, products or services, or our online platforms are severely interrupted or\notherwise fail to meet our customers’ requests, our reputation could be adversely affected.\nAs an e-commerce company, we have limited ability to allow buyers to touch, test and feel products, personally interact with sales and customer\nservice representatives, and receive or return products without waiting or paying for the products to be shipped, like brick-and-mortar retailers or\nonline retailers that have brick-and-mortar operations do. Therefore, it is important that we continue to improve our online platforms, including\nefforts to encourage the creation of more high-quality and useful user-generated content, such as reviews and commentary, on the products we and\nour Marketplace sellers offer. If we do not continue to make investments in the development of our online platforms and customer service\noperations and, as a result, or due to other reasons, fail to provide a high-quality customer experience, we may lose customers, which could\nadversely impact our operating results.\nWe currently operate customer service centers in California and Texas, focusing on serving North American buyers. Any material disruption or\nslowdown in our customer support services resulting from telephone or internet failures, power or service outages, natural disasters, labor disputes\nor other events could make it difficult or impossible for us to provide adequate customer support. In addition, the future volume of customer\ncomplaints and inquiries may exceed our present system capacities. If this occurs, we could experience delays in responding to customer inquiries\nand addressing customer complaints and concerns. Our current level of customer support may also fail to meet the expectations of customers.\nFailure to provide satisfactory levels of customer service may harm our reputation, causing potential loss of existing customers and difficulty in\nacquiring new customers.\n6\nSome of our software and systems contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\nWe have incorporated open source software code into some of our internal software and systems and expect to continue to use this open source\nsoftware in the future. The licenses applicable to open source software typically require that the source code subject to the license be made available\nto the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. From time\nto time, we may face intellectual property infringement claims from third parties, demands for the release or license of the open source software or\nderivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code) or claims that otherwise seek to enforce\nthe terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license, publicly\nrelease the affected portions of our source code, be limited in the licensing of our technologies or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and\nuntil we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement or change the use of the implicated open source software. In addition to risks related to license\nrequirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors\ngenerally do not provide warranties, indemnities or other contractual protections with respect to the software (for example, non-infringement or\nfunctionality). Our use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the source code for open source software is\npublicly available, which may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our websites, mobile apps and systems\nthat rely on open source software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our Marketplace sellers’ pricing strategy may not meet customers’ price expectations or result in profitability.\nDemand for our products is generally highly sensitive to price. Our pricing strategies have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on\nour net sales and net income. We often offer discounted prices, free or discounted shipping or bundled products as a means of attracting customers\nand encouraging repeat purchases. Such offers and discounts may reduce our margins. Moreover, our competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies\nare beyond our control and can significantly impact the results of our pricing strategies. If we fail to meet our customers’ price expectations in any\ngiven period, or if our competitors decide to engage in aggressive pricing strategies, our business and results of operations would suffer.\nIn addition, under applicable federal and state unfair competition laws, including the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and U.S. Federal\nTrade Commission regulations, we are required to accurately identify product offerings, not make misleading claims on our platforms, and use\nqualifying disclosures where and when appropriate. We are particularly subject to the risks associated with our discounting pricing practices as a\nresult of the aggressive judicial interpretations of deceptive pricing laws, particularly in California, which has led to numerous class action\nsettlements by online and brick-and-mortar retailers in the past. For example, Newegg was named as the defendant in a putative class action\naccusing it of violating the False Advertising Law, the Unfair Competition Law and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act by using allegedly deceptive\nlist prices with allegedly overstated discounts for our products. This matter was dismissed by the court on September 18, 2023 for failure to\nprosecute. An adverse outcome in any other lawsuits challenging deceptive pricing against us could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,\nbusiness and financial condition.\nWe generally are not able to control the pricing strategies of our Marketplace sellers, which could affect our net income and our ability to effectively\ncompete on price with other e-commerce retailers and brick-and-mortar stores. Our inability to execute an effective pricing strategy, or a\ndetermination by our Marketplace sellers that they can more competitively price their products through other distribution channels could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n7\nOperational Risks\nWe face risks related to system interruption, including failures caused or experienced by third-party service providers, and lack of redundancy\nand timely upgrades.\nOur success depends on our ability to successfully receive and fulfill orders and to promptly deliver such orders to our customers. We could lose\nexisting customers or fail to attract new customers, potentially resulting in a decline in net sales, if our online platforms are inaccessible or if our\ntransaction processing systems, order fulfillment processes or network infrastructure are not operational or performing to our customers’\nsatisfaction.\nAny internet network interruptions, latency or problems with our online platforms’ availability could prevent customers from accessing, browsing\nand placing orders on our online platforms, and impact our ability to fulfill orders or bill customers, which may cause customer dissatisfaction and\ndamage our reputation and brand. We have experienced brief computer system interruptions in the past and believe that others will occur from time\nto time in the future. Our systems and operations potentially are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of sources, including the\nfollowing:\n● natural disaster or other catastrophic event such as earthquake, fire, power loss or interruption, telecommunications failure, hurricane,\nvolcanic eruption, flood or terrorist attack. For example, our headquarters and the majority of our infrastructure, including some of our\nservers, are located in Southern California, a seismically active region. In addition, California has in the past experienced power outages as\na result of limited electric power supply;\n● diseases or pandemics (such as COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect the supply chain of our brand partners and\nMarketplace sellers, and our logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, other diseases or pandemics or\nunforeseen natural disasters;\n● computer malware, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions;\n● security breaches and hacking attacks;\n● failure by third-party vendors, including data center and bandwidth providers, to provide steady and high-speed access to our online\nplatforms and systems. Any disruption in our network access or co-location services, which are the services that house some of our servers\nand provide internet access to them, provided by these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party vendors to handle existing or\nhigher volumes of use could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these vendors face could also adversely\naffect our business; and\n● incidents of fraud.\nWe have not yet created sufficient redundancy for our information technology systems and data, and we do not presently maintain backup copies of\nall of its data. Newegg has a limited disaster recovery plan in effect and may not have sufficient insurance for losses that may occur from natural\ndisasters, catastrophic events or the resulting business interruption. Any substantial damage to, or disruption of, our technology infrastructure could\ncause interruptions or delays, loss of data, or reduced system availability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to accurately project the rate or timing of traffic flow, including any traffic increases, or successfully and cost-effectively upgrade\nour systems and infrastructure in a timely manner to accommodate higher traffic levels on our online platforms. If the volume of traffic on our\nonline platforms or the number of purchases made by our customers increases substantially, we may experience unanticipated system disruptions,\nslower response times, reduced levels of customer service and impaired quality and delays in reporting accurate financial information. For example,\nwe experience surges in online traffic and orders associated with promotional activities and holiday seasons, especially during Black Friday and the\nChristmas holiday season, which can put additional demands on our technology platform at specific times.\nAdditionally, we must continue to upgrade and improve our technology and infrastructure to support our business growth, and failure to do so could\nimpede our growth. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing these system upgrades and improvement strategies. Any\nsuch upgrades to our systems and infrastructure could require substantial investments. In particular, our systems may experience interruptions\nduring upgrades, and the new technologies or infrastructures may not be fully integrated with the existing systems on a timely basis, or at all. If our\nexisting or future technology and infrastructure do not function properly, it could cause system disruptions and slow response times, affecting data\ntransmission, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n8\nWe rely on third-party payment processors to process deposits and withdrawals made by users of our Marketplace, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party payment solutions to process deposits and withdrawals made by users of our Marketplace. If any third-\nparty payment solution terminates its relationship with Newegg or refuses to renew its agreement with Newegg on commercially reasonable terms,\nwe would need to find an alternate payment solution, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment solution in an acceptable\ntime frame. Further, the software and services provided by our third-party payment solutions may not meet our expectations, contain errors or\nvulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other\npayment transactions or make timely payments to users of our Marketplace, any of which could make our Marketplace less trustworthy and\nconvenient and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain our users.\nNearly all of our users’ payments are made by credit card, debit card or through other third-party payment services, which subjects Newegg to\ncertain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to users that may be subject to additional regulations\nand risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from our users, including with respect to\nmoney laundering, money transfers, privacy and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject\nto civil or criminal penalties, fines and/or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card\ntransactions, which could make our Marketplace less convenient and attractive to our users. If any of these events were to occur, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, card organizations, including Visa, require Newegg to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and\ninterpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules in\nways that might prohibit us from providing certain offerings to some users, be costly to implement or difficult to follow. We have agreed to\nreimburse our payment processors for fines, penalties or assessments that are assessed by card organizations if we or the users on our Marketplace\nviolate these rules, and as a result we may be subject to fines, penalties or assessments assessed by card organizations against us from time to time.\nAny of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key employees or the failure to attract or retain qualified personnel can have a material adverse effect on our ability to run our\nbusiness.\nThe loss of any of our current executives, key employees or key advisors, or the failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain additional key\nemployees, can have a material adverse effect on our business. Competition for well-qualified and skilled employees has been increasingly intense,\nand our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees,\nincluding, in particular, software engineers, data scientists and technology and fulfillment professionals. Although we have employment agreements\nwith our executive officers, all of our executive officers are employed “at-will” and could terminate their employment at any time. If we lose one or\nmore of our executive officers or other key employees, our ability to implement our business strategy successfully can be seriously harmed.\nFurthermore, replacing executive officers or other key employees with other highly skilled and qualified candidates has been and may continue to\nbe difficult, taking an extended period of time. For example, as previously announced, our Chief Financial Officer, Robert Chang, is retiring\neffective May 17, 2024. While the search for a permanent replacement is ongoing, these processes can be time-consuming and disruptive to our\nbusiness, and we cannot guarantee that a suitable candidate will be identified in a timely manner. Recruiting skilled personnel is highly competitive.\nThe increased availability of flexible or remote work arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition for qualified personnel. There\ncan be no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain the personnel needed for our business. The failure to attract or retain qualified\npersonnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n9\nA significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential or personal information we hold could be detrimental to our business, reputation\nand results of operations.\nOur business requires the storage, transmission and utilization of data, including personal information, much of which must be maintained on a\nconfidential basis. These activities have made, and may in the future make, us a target of cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access\nto the data we maintain, including our customer data, or to disrupt our ability to provide service. As a result of the types and volume of personal\ndata on our systems, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks. For example, in 2018, Newegg suffered an\nintrusion of a portion of its network, as a result of which access was gained to a limited amount of credit card information.\nIn recent years, the frequency, severity and sophistication of cyber-attacks, computer malware, viruses, social engineering, and other intentional\nmisconduct by computer hackers has significantly increased, and government agencies and security experts have warned about the growing risks of\nhackers, cyber criminals and other potential attackers targeting information technology systems. Such third parties could attempt to gain entry to our\nsystems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems. In addition, our security measures may also be breached due to employee error,\nmalfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, suppliers, their products, or otherwise. Third parties may also\nattempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information to\ngain access to our customers’ data or our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information.\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security breaches, these measures could fail or may be insufficient,\nparticularly as techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until\nlaunched against a target, resulting in the unauthorized disclosure, modification, misuse, destruction, or loss of our or our customers’ data or other\nsensitive information. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of the data we maintain, including\npersonal information, could result in litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory enforcement actions, investigations, fines, penalties, mitigation\nand remediation costs, disputes, reputational harm, diversion of management’s attention, and other liabilities and damage to our business.\nWe believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our systems from intrusion, but we cannot be certain that advances in criminal\ncapabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities in our systems and attempts to exploit those vulnerabilities, physical system or facility break-ins and\ndata thefts or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting our systems and the information we possess.\nWe may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any security breach could result in operational disruptions that\nimpair our ability to meet our customers’ requirements, which could result in decreased revenue. Also, whether there is an actual or a perceived\nbreach of our security, our reputation could suffer irreparable harm, causing our current and prospective customers to reject our products and\nservices in the future, deterring data suppliers from supplying us data or customers from uploading their data on our platform, or changing\nconsumer behaviors and use of our technology. Further, we could be forced to expend significant resources in response to a security breach,\nincluding those expended in notifying individuals and providing mitigating services, repairing system damage, increasing cybersecurity protection\ncosts by deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, and litigating and resolving legal claims or governmental inquiries and\ninvestigations, all of which could divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations. Federal, state and\nforeign governments continue to consider and implement laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection laws,\nwhich include provisions relating to breaches. In any event, a significant security breach could materially harm our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nWe may not succeed in promoting and strengthening the Newegg brand, which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of\noperations.\nBrand recognition is a primary competitive factor in the e-commerce market and will be a key factor in maintaining and expanding our customer\nbase, market position and bargaining power with vendors. Any loss of trust in our brand could harm our reputation and result in consumers, sellers,\nbrands, vendors and other participants reducing their activity level in our business, which could materially reduce our profitability.\n10\nIf we do not, or are unable to continue to, promote and strengthen the Newegg brand, or if the brand fails to continue to be viewed favorably, we\nmay not be successful in attracting new customers and Marketplace sellers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand results of operations. Additionally, we compete not only for customers and Marketplace sellers, but also for favorable product allocations and\ncooperative advertising support from our vendors. If we fail to maintain favorable recognition of our brand, we may not be successful in\nmaintaining and strengthening our relationships with vendors in existing and new product categories or in maintaining existing offerings and\nsourcing new products at competitive prices and with adequate levels of inventory.\nAdverse publicity about Newegg may arise from time to time. Negative comments about our online platforms, the products and services offered by\nus and our Marketplace sellers or our management may appear in internet postings and other media sources from time to time, and there is no\nassurance that other types of negative publicity of a more serious nature will not arise in the future. For example, if our customer service\nrepresentatives fail to satisfy the individual needs of the customers, the customers may become disgruntled and disseminate negative comments\nabout our customer service. In addition, our Marketplace sellers and brand partners may also be subject to negative publicity for various reasons,\nsuch as customers’ complaints about the quality of their products and related services or other public relations incidents, which may adversely affect\nthe sales of their products through Newegg and indirectly affect our reputation. Moreover, negative publicity about other online retailers or the e-\ncommerce industry in general may arise from time to time and cause customers to lose confidence in the products and services Newegg offers. Any\nsuch negative publicity, regardless of veracity, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial condition.\nOur business, operating results, and cash flows may be adversely impacted by inflation.\nDue to labor and supply chain constraints, there has been a volatile inflationary environment resulting in significant increases to the cost of\ncomponents, labor and freight costs and other expenses. Recent inflationary pressures have affected, and may continue to affect, wages, the cost and\nour ability to obtain products, the price of our goods and services, our ability to meet customer demand, discretionary consumer spending that may\nlead to lesser demand for our products, our gross margins and operating profit. If we are unable to successfully manage the effects of inflation, our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, inflation may amplify or exacerbate many of\nthe other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which, although currently remediated, could recur\nand affect the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and have other adverse consequences.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain\neffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide\nreliable financial reports. Nevertheless, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems\ndetermined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nAs described in Item 15 of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, we previously determined that we had material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented\nenhanced procedures to remediate the deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that resulted in the material weaknesses. Based on\nthe results of our remediation plan and assessment, we have concluded that the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting\npreviously identified have been successfully remediated as of December 31, 2023. However, completion of remediation for these material\nweaknesses does not provide assurance that our remediated controls will continue to operate properly and as a result, that our financial statements\nwill be free from material error.\n11\nAlthough currently remediated, previously existing material weaknesses could recur, or other material weaknesses could arise, and result in material\nmisstatements to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that might not be prevented or detected on a timely basis or result in\ndelayed filing of required periodic reports. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may\nlose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected and\nwe could become subject to additional litigation, investigations or inquiries by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require\nadditional financial and management resources.\nWe are, or may become, subject to risks associated with our international operations, principally in Canada, which may harm our business.\nNewegg began operations on our Canadian retail website, www.newegg.ca, in October 2008. We also have a physical presence in China and\nTaiwan. While we may invest in building our business in other markets, we may not be able to successfully manage the challenges associated with\nour current and future international operations due to risks, such as:\n● international economic and political conditions or geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks, war, or other armed\nhostilities);\n● changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements on e-commerce businesses and companies, such as U.S. sanctions laws\nand regulations, and limitations on our ability to directly own or control key assets, such as overseas warehouses;\n● the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to consumer privacy and data protection laws, tax, law\nenforcement, network security, climate and emissions regulations, trade compliance and intellectual property matters, as well as consumer\nlitigation;\n● tax laws, regulations and treaties, including U.S. taxes on foreign operations and repatriation of funds;\n● difficulties in identifying, attracting, hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, and overseeing international operations, including\nthe efficient management of our international operations;\n● delays or additional costs resulting from import/export controls, duties, tariffs or other barriers to trade; and\n● currency exchange controls or changes in exchange rates, which could make our pricing less competitive or reduce our profit margins.\nAny one of the foregoing factors could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.\nAny future expansion into new product categories, services, technologies and geographic regions may subject us to additional business, legal,\nfinancial and competitive risks.\nAny future expansion into new product categories, services, technologies and regions, such as our expansion into Canada and our third-party service\nofferings under Newegg Partner Services (“NPS”), is subject to risk. In directing our focus into new areas, we face numerous risks and challenges,\nincluding alienating our core customer base, facing new competitors, having the increased need to develop new strategic relationships and straining\nour management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions.\nThere is no assurance that our strategy will result in increased net sales or net income. Furthermore, growth into new business areas may require\nchanges to our existing business model and cost structure, modifications to our infrastructure, and exposure to new regulatory and legal risks related\nto operating in new jurisdictions, any of which may require expertise in areas in which we have little or no experience. These risks may pose a\nmaterial adverse risk to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n12\nAny interruption in our fulfillment operations may have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to process and fulfill orders accurately and provide high-quality customer service depends on the smooth operation of our fulfillment\ninfrastructure, including our warehouses and order processing centers. If we do not optimize and operate our fulfillment infrastructure successfully\nand efficiently, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment capacity, an increase in costs or impairment charges and a reduction in our gross\nprofit margin, or harm our business in other ways. If we do not have sufficient fulfillment capacity or experience a problem fulfilling orders in a\ntimely manner or if certain products are out of stock, our customers may experience delays in receiving their orders, which could harm our\nreputation and our relationship with our customers.\nOur fulfillment infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage caused by fire, floods, power outages, telecommunications failures, break-ins,\nearthquakes, human error and other events. For example, our warehouse located in Indianapolis experienced a significant fire in January 2019,\ncausing damage to our inventory. In addition, in May 2022, our warehouse located in Toronto, Canada experienced a break-in and theft of\napproximately $3.4 million of inventory. Our fulfillment infrastructure and processes may also contain undetected errors or design flaws that may\ncause our fulfillment operations to fail and materially impact our business and results of operations. If, for example, any of our warehouses were\nrendered incapable of operations, we may be unable to fulfill any orders in areas that rely on that warehouse. While we maintain property and\nbusiness interruption insurance to protect against losses of this nature, we cannot guarantee that such insurance will be available in the future at\nterms and rates acceptable to us, nor can we guarantee that any related insurance claims will be paid out in a timely manner, or at all. The\noccurrence of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party courier service providers to deliver our products, and their failure to provide high-quality courier\nservices in a timely manner, if at all, to our customers may negatively impact the procurement experience of our customers, damage our market\nreputation and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party courier service providers to deliver products to our customers. For the periods of the fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 85.3% and 78.2%, respectively, of our total packages were shipped by our top three third-party courier\nservice providers. Interruptions to or failures in these couriers’ shipping services could prevent the timely or successful delivery of our products.\nThese interruptions may be due to unforeseen events that are beyond our control or the control of these third-party couriers, such as inclement\nweather, natural disasters or labor unrest. If our products are not delivered on time or are delivered in a damaged state, customers may refuse to\naccept our products and have less confidence in our services. As a result, we could lose customers, and our financial condition and market\nreputation could suffer.\nPandemics or other public health crises, natural disasters, climate change, terrorist activities, and political unrest could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGlobal pandemics, epidemics or other public health crises, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, fire, drought, rising sea\nlevels, or other severe weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, could disrupt our business operations, reduce or restrict\nour operations and services, incur significant costs to protect our employees and facilities, or result in regional or global economic distress, which\nmay materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and the\nvarious responses to it negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains and created significant\nvolatility and disruption of financial markets. Any future outbreaks or emergence of new strains of the virus may have an adverse effect on the\nresults of our future operations. Additionally, actual or threatened war, terrorist activities, political unrest, civil strife, and other geopolitical\nuncertainty could have a similar adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the long-term effects of global climate change are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. The potential impacts of climate\nchange present a variety of risks. The physical effects of climate change, such as severe weather conditions, tsunamis, fire, drought, and rising sea\nlevels, could adversely affect our results of operations, including by increasing our energy costs, disrupting our supply chain, negatively impacting\nour workforce, damaging our distribution centers and inventory, causing disruptions or the complete shutdown of our operations and facilities, and\nthreatening the habitability of the locations in which we operate. In addition to physical risks, the potential impacts of climate change also present\ntransition risks, including regulatory and reputational risks. For example, we use commodities and energy inputs in our operations that may face\nincreased regulation due to climate change or other environmental concerns. Such policies could result in increased production costs including\nhigher energy and raw materials prices, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. New and evolving\nregulations on climate and emissions disclosures could cause our expenses to increase.\nIt is difficult to assess the likelihood of such threat and any potential impact at this time. Any one or more of these events may impede our operation\nand delivery efforts and adversely affect our sales results, or even for a prolonged period of time, which could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\n13\nWe depend on our vendors to source sufficient quantities of merchandise on favorable terms. If we fail to maintain strong vendor relationships\nor if our vendors are otherwise unable to supply products that meet our standards in a timely manner, our net sales and net income could suffer.\nOur contracts or arrangements with vendors generally do not guarantee the availability of merchandise or provide for the continuation of particular\npricing or other practices. Our vendors may not continue to sell their inventory to us on current terms or at all, and, if the terms are changed, we\nmay not be able to establish new supply relationships on similar or better terms. In most cases, our relationships with our vendors do not restrict\nthem from selling their products through our competitors. Newegg competes with other retailers for favorable product allocations and vendor\nincentives from product manufacturers and distributors, including but not limited to marketing dollars and volume-based sales incentive programs.\nSome of our competitors could enter into exclusive or favorable distribution arrangements for certain products with our vendors, which would deny\nus complete or partial access to those products and marketing and promotional resources. In addition, some vendors whose products are offered on\nour online platforms also sell their products directly to customers. If we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with vendors that permit\nus to obtain sufficient quantities of desirable merchandise on favorable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely impacted.\nOur relationship with any particular vendor is dependent on our sales of products manufactured or distributed by that vendor. For certain products,\nwe do not currently, and in the future may not be able to, meet the sales volumes or other requirements necessary to receive favorable treatment\nfrom the manufacturer of that product. As a result, we may not receive favorable pricing, vendor incentives or other considerations from those\nvendors. During times of short supply for highly desirable products, we may not receive adequate, or any, allocation of a popular product, leading to\nlost sales and customer dissatisfaction.\nCertain products help create and maintain customer loyalty to the Newegg brand. Failing to maintain an adequate supply of these products could\ndamage our ability to retain customers. We currently do not carry the full product portfolio of, and in some cases do not carry any products of,\ncertain well-known brands. As a result, consumers who are searching for those brands may not be able to purchase products from us or purchase\nthem at the most favorable prices, leading to potentially reduced net sales and net income.\nCertain vendors provide a significant portion of our merchandise. In the United States and Canada, for the twelve months ended December 31,\n2023, our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 71% of the merchandise we purchased. Three of our ten largest suppliers, ASI\nCorporation, MSI Computer Corporation, and TD Synnex, accounted for approximately 38% of our purchases for the same period. Failure to\nmaintain a positive relationship with these key suppliers could impact our ability to sell to customers the products they want.\nOur vendors’ financial performance, liquidity and access to capital may be materially adversely affected by many factors, including, but not limited\nto: general economic factors, such as a continued slowdown in the U.S. or global economy or an uncertain economic outlook; political or financial\ninstability; merchandise quality issues; product safety concerns; trade restrictions; work stoppages; tariffs; international trade war; foreign currency\nexchange rates; transportation capacity and costs; inflation; or outbreak of pandemics. These and other issues may affect their ability to maintain\ntheir inventories, production levels and/or product quality and could cause them to raise prices, lower production levels or cease their operations, all\nof which may in turn materially adversely affect our net sales and net income.\nWe conduct marketing activities to help attract visitors to our online platforms, and if we are unable to attract these visitors or convert them into\ncustomers in a cost-effective manner, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract visitors to our online platforms and convert them into customers in a cost-effective manner. We rely on\nsearch engines, social media, shopping comparison sites and other affiliate networks to provide content, advertising banners and other links that\ndirect visitors to our online platforms. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 24% of our website and mobile app visitors were referred to us\nthrough paid and unpaid search engine listings, shopping comparison sites and other affiliate networks that provide links to our online platforms. In\nparticular, we rely on search engines, such as Google and Microsoft Bing and social media platforms, such as TikTok, Facebook and Instagram, as\nimportant marketing channels. Some of these marketing channels, most notably TikTok, have been subject to various forms of data privacy,\nregulatory and national security scrutiny, as well as mounting political pressure to potentially limit or restrict the use of such channels. If such\nefforts to limit or restrict these channels are successful, our ability to engage and interact with existing and potential customers could be\nsignificantly limited, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our business results. Further, if search engines or social media\nplatforms change their search engine algorithms periodically or penalize us for non-compliance with their guidelines while using their algorithms,\nterms of service, or display and featuring of search results, or if competition increases for advertisements, we may be unable to cost-effectively\ndrive visitors to our websites and mobile apps. We also sometimes pay these third parties to include or highlight our websites in their search results.\nIf such third parties modify or terminate their relationship with us or increase the price they charge to us, if our competitors offer them greater fees\nfor traffic, or if any free third-party platforms on which we rely begin charging fees for listing or placement, our expenses could rise and traffic to\nour websites could decrease, resulting in harm to our operations.\n14\nOur success also depends on our ability to convert visitors to our websites and mobile apps into paying customers, a process which is partially\nreliant upon our ability to identify and purchase relevant keyword search terms, provide relevant content on our online platforms and effectively\ntarget our other marketing programs, such as internet portal referrals, email campaigns and affiliate programs. If we are unable to attract visitors to\nour websites and mobile apps and convert them into customers cost-effectively, our business and financial results may be harmed.\nBecause many of the products that we sell are manufactured abroad, we may face delays, increased cost or quality control deficiencies in the\nimportation of these products, which could reduce our net sales and profitability.\nMany of the products that we purchase for direct sale on our online platforms are manufactured in countries outside the United States. These\nimported products subject us to the risk of changes in import duties or quotas, new restrictions on imports, work stoppages, delays in shipment,\nfreight cost increases, product cost increases due to foreign currency fluctuations or revaluations and economic uncertainties (including the\nimposition of antidumping or countervailing duty orders, safeguards, remedies or compensation and retaliation due to illegal foreign trade practices)\nand instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the manufacturers of these products operate. If any of these or\nother factors were to cause a disruption of trade from these countries, we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these imported products to\nsatisfy our requirements or our cost of obtaining such products may increase. Historically, instability in the political and economic environments of\nthe countries in which our suppliers operate has not had a material adverse effect on our operations. However, the effect that future changes in\neconomic or political conditions in the foreign countries where our supplying manufacturers are located may have on our operations cannot be\npredicted. Potential disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries could adversely affect our results of\noperations unless and until alternative supply arrangements are made.\nWe are partially dependent on third parties to perform a number of our e-commerce functions. If such third parties are unwilling or unable to\ncontinue providing these services, our business could be harmed.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 8.6% of our gross merchandise value (“GMV”) was generated by the sale of products fulfilled through\nthird parties. These third parties provide various services on our behalf, including inventory maintenance and order processing. We have no\neffective means to ensure that these third parties will continue to perform these services to our satisfaction, in a manner satisfactory to our\ncustomers or on commercially reasonable terms. Our customers may become dissatisfied and cancel their orders or decline to make future purchases\nif these third parties fail to deliver products on a timely basis. If our customers become dissatisfied with the services provided by these third parties,\nour reputation and brand could suffer.\nIf we fail to manage our inventory effectively, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially and adversely\naffected.\nOur scale and business model require us to manage a large volume of inventory effectively. If we expand our product offerings and include more\nSKUs in our inventory, it could make it more challenging for us to manage our inventory effectively and put more pressure on our warehousing\nsystem.\n15\nWe purchase most of the merchandise that we sell directly to customers on our online platforms from manufacturers or distributors. We assume\ninventory damage, theft, obsolescence, and price erosion risks for our inventory. These risks are especially significant as most of the merchandise\nsold on our online platforms is characterized by rapid technological change, obsolescence and price erosion. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwe recorded inventory write-offs or write-downs totaling $5.0 million, or 0.4% of our cost of goods sold. We may sell obsolete or dated\nmerchandise at a discount or loss. If there were unforeseen product developments or if vendors were to change their terms and conditions, our\ninventory risks could increase. We also periodically take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases\noffered by our vendors. These bulk purchases increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence. Our success depends on our ability to sell our\ninventory rapidly, purchase inventory at attractive prices relative to our resale value and manage customer returns and the shrinkage resulting from\ntheft, loss, and misrecording of inventory. If we are unsuccessful in any of these areas, we may be forced to write down or write off substantial\namounts of inventory, or sell it at a discount or loss, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe depend on our demand forecasts for various kinds of products to make purchase decisions and to manage our inventory. We are exposed to\ninventory risks as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in\nconsumer demand, tastes and spending patterns, and other factors. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\nunderstocking products we sell, the demand for products can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale, and we\nmay be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities as we expect. Furthermore, we may in the future open additional warehouses and duplicate\npart of the inventory for our direct sales business that is stored at our current warehouses to increase our overall fulfillment efficiency as we grow\nour business, which will also increase the inventory risks our direct sales business faces. Failure to effectively manage our inventory risk could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and may experience losses in the future.\nWe incurred net losses of $59.0 million and $57.4 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and reported net income of $36.3 million and $30.4\nmillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate net profits or positive cash flow from operating\nactivities in the future. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend in large part on our ability to, among other things, source and\nsell higher margin products, grow and diversify our supplier base, and optimize our cost structure. We may not be able to achieve any of the above.\nIf we grow and expand our business, our operating expenses may increase further. As a result of the foregoing, we may incur net losses in the\nfuture.\nIf we fail to adopt new technologies or adapt our websites, mobile apps and systems to changing customer requirements or emerging industry\nstandards, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our online platforms, including\nour websites and mobile apps. The internet and the e-commerce industry are characterized by rapid technological evolution, such as emerging\nartificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning technologies, frequent introductions of new products and services embodying new technologies\nand the emergence of new industry standards and practices, and changes in customer requirements and preferences, any of which could render our\nexisting technologies and systems obsolete. We may be required to devote substantial resources to developing proprietary technologies or license\ntechnologies, enhancing our existing websites and mobile apps, developing new services and technology such as AI and machine learning that\naddress the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers and adapting to technological advances and\nemerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner. The development of proprietary technology entails\nsignificant technical and business risks. There can be no assurance that our efforts to develop proprietary technologies will succeed or that any\ntechnology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms. Substantial investments will be required to remain technologically\ncompetitive, and our failure to do so may harm our business and results of operations.\n16\nThe seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations.\nNewegg historically experiences higher sales in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. If we do not stock or restock popular products in\nsufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and future growth. If we overstock products,\nwe may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may\nexperience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments and additional long-zone shipments necessary for\ntimely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our online platforms within a short period of time due to increased holiday\ndemand, we may experience system interruptions that make our online platforms unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which\nmay reduce the volume of goods sold through our online platforms and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be\nunable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service capability during these peak periods.\nAs we tend to experience higher sales in the fourth quarter, we generally experience an increase in our cash position at year-end, as compared to the\nfirst, second and third quarters when sales are lower. Historically, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach\ntheir highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) at December 31 of each year. In\nanticipation of higher sales during the holiday season, we typically begin building up inventory levels in the later part of the third quarter. As a\nresult of this inventory build-up and faster inventory turnover during the fourth quarter, our accounts payable are typically at their highest levels at\nyear-end. As sales begin to slow in the first and second quarters, inventory levels decrease, inventory turnover lengthens, and accounts payable and\ncash balances decrease as we pay our vendors. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, accounts payable amounted to\napproximately $206.6 million and $207.1 million, respectively.\nMany of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer\npreferences.\nWe operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. This manifests itself in a\nvariety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, the often rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, changing\nprice points and product replacement and upgrade cycles.\nThis rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do so all the time. If we fail to interpret,\npredict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our\ncustomers want; excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for\nwhich consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in\nproduct trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. In addition, consumer preferences may be influenced even further as the social and\neconomic environment navigates through the post-pandemic environment. These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on\nour revenue and profitability.\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance, reliability and security of the internet infrastructure in the countries\nwhere we operate.\nOur business depends on the performance, reliability and security of the telecommunications and internet infrastructure in the countries where we\noperate. We have several servers located in China that provide development, testing and quality control services. Almost all access to the internet in\nChina is maintained through state-owned telecommunication operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the Ministry\nof Industry and Information Technology of the People’s Republic of China. In addition, the national networks in China are connected to the internet\nthrough state-owned international gateways, which are the only channels through which a domestic user can connect to the internet outside China.\nWe may face similar or other limitations in other countries in which we operate. We may not have access to alternative networks in the event of\ndisruptions, failures or other problems with the internet infrastructure in China or elsewhere. In addition, the internet infrastructure in the countries\nin which we operate may not support the demands associated with continued growth in internet usage.\n17\nThe failure of telecommunications network operators to provide Newegg with the requisite bandwidth could also interfere with the speed and\navailability of our websites and mobile apps. If the prices that we pay for telecommunications and internet services rise significantly, our net income\ncould be adversely affected. In addition, if internet access fees or other charges to internet users increase, our user traffic may decrease, which in\nturn may significantly decrease our revenues.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth or execute our strategies effectively, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely\naffected.\nOur success depends upon our ability to manage the growth of our operations effectively. We anticipate expanding further as we pursue our growth\nstrategies. Our expansion increases the complexity of our business and places a significant strain on our management, operations, technical systems,\nfinancial resources and internal control over financial reporting functions. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may\nnot be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations, especially as we employ personnel in several geographic locations. In\naddition, our growth will require us to improve our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, successfully manage international\noperations and hire additional personnel. These efforts may not be successful, and we may be unable to improve our systems, procedures and\ncontrols in a timely manner.\nDelays or problems associated with any of these initiatives could harm our business and operating results. These initiatives will also cause our\noperating expenses to increase. If we fail to accurately estimate and assess our growth or fail to increase net sales to match our increased operating\nexpenses, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nAn adverse change in our vendor payment terms and conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe purchase our inventory from vendors on trade accounts typically requiring payment between 30 and 60 days after the date the inventory is\nshipped to us. As of December 31, 2023, our accounts payable balance was $206.6 million with 56 days of payables outstanding. Our accounts\npayable balances as of December 31, 2023 represented 41.4% of our liabilities and shareholders’ equity. An adverse change in our vendors’ payment\nterms and conditions would significantly increase our working capital requirements and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nSince the Merger, we have implemented a variety of measures designed to comply with the rules applicable to public companies in the United\nStates. To the extent these new procedures and policies have not changed historical behaviors that might be inconsistent with the rules and practices\nregulating a U.S. public company, we could be at risk of violation or poor reporting as a public company. If our directors or executive officers\ninadvertently fail to identify, review or disclose a new relationship or arrangement causing the Company to fail to properly disclose any related\nparty transaction or in the event that we fail to comply with SEC reporting and internal controls and procedures, we may be subject to securities\nlaws violations that may result in additional compliance costs or costs associated with SEC judgments or fines, both of which will increase our costs\nand negatively affect our potential profitability and our ability to conduct our business. These public reporting requirements may require us to\nobtain outside assistance from legal, accounting or other professionals that may increase our costs of doing business.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a revolving credit agreement, which contains a number of covenants that may restrict our\ncurrent and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to execute business needs.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries have entered into certain credit agreements with financial institutions which contains a number of covenants that\nlimit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, create liens, make investments, merge with other\ncompanies, dispose of our assets, prepay other indebtedness and make other distributions. The obligations under the credit agreements are also\nguaranteed by our assets or those of our subsidiaries.\n18\nThe terms of these credit agreements may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future\noperations or capital needs or to execute business strategies in the means or manner desired. In addition, complying with these covenants may make\nit more difficult to successfully execute our business strategy, invest in our growth strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to\nsuch restrictions. The credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain certain minimum financial ratios and maintain\nan operating banking relationship with the financial institutions. Although we are currently in compliance with the financial covenants, we cannot\nguarantee that we will continue to be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal or interest\nunder the credit agreements.\nIf we are unable to comply with our payment requirements, the financial institutions may accelerate our obligations under the credit agreement and\nforeclose upon the collateral, or we may be forced to sell assets, restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital, which would dilute\nshareholders’ interests. If we fail to comply with any covenant it could result in an event of default under the agreement and the lenders could make\nthe entire debt immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we might not be able to repay the debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if\nnew financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. See “Note 8 - Line of Credit” to our consolidated financial statements\nfor more information.\nOur international sales and operations require access to international markets and are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export and\nimport controls and economic sanctions, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nNewegg must comply with all applicable U.S. export and import laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the\nExport Administration Act and the Export Administration Regulations. Newegg must also comply with U.S. sanctions laws and regulations, which\nare primarily administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as other U.S. government agencies. U.S.\nsanctions generally prohibit transactions by U.S. persons, including us, involving sanctioned countries, entities and persons, without U.S.\ngovernment authorization (which will rarely be granted). Non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. companies are required to comply with U.S. sanctions\nagainst Cuba and Iran.\nViolations of U.S. laws and regulations relating to trade, export and import controls and economic sanctions could result in significant civil and/or\ncriminal penalties on us or on our foreign subsidiaries, including fines, prohibitions on exporting and importing, prohibitions on receiving\ngovernment contracts or other government assistance and other trade-related restrictions. U.S. enforcement of such laws and regulations continues\nto increase.\nWe must also comply with applicable foreign laws relating to trade, export and import controls and economic sanctions. We may not be aware of all\nof such laws applicable in the markets in which we do business, which subjects us to the risk of potential violations.\nWe may need additional capital and failure to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to grow our\nbusiness and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash flow from operations and borrowings are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next\n12 months. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any\ninvestments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell\nadditional equity or debt securities, or draw from or refinance our credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to\nour shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and\nfinancing covenants that would restrict our operations. Our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of\nuncertainties, including:\n● investors’ perception of, and demand for, our securities;\n19\n● conditions of the U.S. and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds; and\n● our future results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns about such developments, have in the past and may in the future lead\nto market-wide liquidity problems and disruptions in the financial services industry. For example, in March 2023, the closure of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank destabilized many financial institutions and created uncertainty across the industry. Although we did not have any funds\nin Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank, future defaults or other similar destabilizing events could impact the credit markets and adversely impact\nour ability to access our capital and to obtain debt financing on favorable terms.\nFinancing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to\nus, or at all, could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our product and service offerings to respond to market demand or\ncompetitive challenges.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\nWe are, or may be, subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, investigations, and other proceedings, involving a wide range of issues,\nincluding patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network\nsecurity, consumer protection, product liability, commercial disputes, and other matters. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse\neffect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The\noutcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from\nsuch matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such\nmatters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and\nassumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or licensing agreements with employees, buyers, third-party\nsellers, brand partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. These steps may be inadequate, agreements may be violated or there may be\ninadequate remedies for a violation of such agreements. Our competitors may independently develop equivalent proprietary information and rights\nor may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information, which could affect our ability to compete in the market. There is no\nassurance that the steps that we have taken will adequately protect our proprietary rights, especially in countries where the laws or enforcement of\nthe laws may not protect our rights to the same extent or in the same way as in the United States.\nIn addition, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights, and we could be required to enforce our intellectual property rights,\nwhich could require expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We have registered and common law trademark rights in the\nUnited States and certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as pending trademark applications for a number of marks and associated domain names. Such\npending applications are not certain to be approved, and even if we obtain approval for such pending applications, the resulting registrations may\nnot adequately cover our trademarks or protect us against infringement or dilution by others. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, patent\nand trade secret protection may not be available in every country or jurisdiction in which our products may be made available online, which may\ncause our business and operating results to suffer. In addition, we may be unable to acquire or protect relevant domain names in the United States\nand in other countries. If we are not able to acquire or protect our trademarks, domain names or other intellectual property, we may experience\ndifficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition and customer loyalty.\n20\nAssertions, claims and allegations, even if not true, that we have infringed or violated intellectual property rights could harm our business and\nreputation.\nThird parties have, and likely will in the future, assert allegations and claims of intellectual property infringement against us on the items or their\ndescriptions listed on our websites and mobile apps. Any such claims, disputes or litigation, even if resolved in our favor or not true, could be time-\nconsuming and costly to defend, and could divert our management’s efforts from growing our business. We have intellectual property complaint and\ntake-down procedures in place to address communications alleging that items listed on online platforms, including the Newegg Marketplace,\ninfringe third-party copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. We follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts\nto determine the appropriate action, which may include removal of the item from our online platforms and, in certain cases, discontinuing our\nrelationship with a Marketplace seller or brand partner who violates our policies. However, these rules and procedures may not effectively reduce or\neliminate our liability. In particular, Newegg may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out, including products listed, by\nsellers or brands on our online platforms.\nIf any third parties prevail in their intellectual property rights claims against Newegg, we may be required to pay significant licensing fees, damages\nand attorney’s fees, and may even be liable for punitive damages if Newegg is found to have willfully infringed third parties’ proprietary rights. We\nmay have to stop using certain technology or solutions and need to develop or acquire alternative, non-infringing technology or solutions, which\ncould require significant time and resources. We could even be required to obtain a license to use certain technologies, although such licenses may\nnot be available on reasonable terms or at all, which may result in substantial payments and royalties and significantly increase our operating\nexpenses. If we cannot develop non-infringing technology or license the appropriate technology at commercially reasonable rates, an intellectual\nproperty claim successfully asserted against us could cause significant business interruptions in our operations, which could restrict our ability to\ncompete effectively and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNewegg may be subject to product liability claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nThe majority of the products sold on our online platforms are manufactured by third parties, and some of them may be defectively designed or\nmanufactured. If any product we sell were to cause physical injury or injury to property, an injured party could bring claims against us as the retailer\nof the product. Furthermore, we also offer computer systems, IT components, peripherals, household appliances and other goods under our private\nlabels, Rosewill and ABS, on our platforms or through other e-commerce platforms, such as eBay, which could potentially create more exposure for\nNewegg with respect to product liability than if we had simply acted as a retailer of third-party products. Our insurance coverage may not be\nadequate against such product liability claims. If a successful claim were brought against Newegg in excess of our insurance coverage, it could\nadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of significant funds and\nmanagement time in defending them and could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nWe may incur additional costs due to tax assessments resulting from ongoing and future audits by tax authorities.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Newegg is subject to tax examinations by various governmental tax authorities. The global and diverse nature of\nour business means that there could be additional examinations by governmental tax authorities and the resolution of ongoing and other probable\naudits which could impose a future risk to the results of our business. For example, in February 2018, we received from the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts Department of Revenue a notice of intent to assess sales and use taxes relating to a prior tax period, which subsequently resulted in\nan assessment of approximately $0.3 million, plus penalties and interest. In May 2020, we received from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nDepartment of Revenue another notice of assessment for sales and use taxes for additional prior tax periods in the amount of a total assessment of\n$2.7 million, including penalties and interest. We appealed these assessments, and ultimately prevailed. However, any similar future matters that are\nnot resolved in our favor could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, and results of operations.\n21\nSignificant developments stemming from recent U.S. government actions and proposals concerning tariffs and other economic proposals could\nhave a material adverse effect on us.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, approximately 65% and 71% of our products that were sold through our platforms, both direct sales and\nmarketplace, were manufactured in China, respectively. U.S. government actions since 2018 have imposed greater restrictions and economic\ndisincentives on international trade impacting imports and exports. The U.S. government has adopted changes, and may adopt further changes, to\ntrade policy and in some cases, to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It imposed\nadditional tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and aluminum, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and spare parts thereof, and has\namended export regulations regarding sales to companies on the U.S. Entity List, and the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and\nadvanced semiconductor technology and commodities to a range of countries, including China. These changes prohibit the sale and other transfers\nof U.S. origin and foreign produced direct products that are manufactured using controlled U.S.-origin and controlled equipment, technology, and\nsoftware located outside the United States to certain companies on the U.S. Entity List and to targeted companies. These regulations continue to\nevolve and have impacts on international supply chains that Newegg relies on for some of its products.\nExamples of other actions include tariffs on steel and aluminum product imports announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce in March 2018,\nthe scope of which increased in February2020. Despite agreements reached with the European Union and other steel exporters, the steel and\naluminum tariffs remain in place with respect to imports from China. Additional actions include tariffs between 7.5% and 25% on certain products\nthat originate in China announced by the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) between June 2018 and September 2019 following an\ninvestigation under Title III of the Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. §§2411-2420 (“Section 301”). These Section 301 tariffs cover over $350 billion\nworth of goods imported from China, including certain semiconductor equipment and parts originating in China that are sold by Newegg or used in\nour business in the United States.\nIn 2020, a group of importers challenged a portion of these tariffs on the basis that the USTR was acting outside of its statutory authority when it\nincreased the scope of the tariffs. On March 17, 2023, the U.S. Court of International Trade upheld the List 3 and List 4a tariffs and rejected\nstatutory and administrative arguments brought by plaintiff importers. The litigation is on appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit and a final decision is expected in late 2024 or early 2025. Separately, in September 2022, the USTR renewed the tariffs after receiving\nrequests for extension from representatives of domestic industries in favor of retaining the tariffs. USTR is currently considering public comments\non the impact and effectiveness of the tariffs as part of a statutorily-required review process.\nIn 2022, the U.S. Congress enacted the CHIPS and Science Act, Pub. L. No. 117-167 (“CHIPS Act”). The CHIPS Act may increase costs for\nNewegg in several ways. First, the law prevents CHIPS Act funding recipients from using the funds to engage in any joint research or technology\nlicensing efforts with foreign entities of concern, which may increase the costs of certain products. The CHIPS Act also may also cause China to\ntake retaliatory action against the United States, which could disrupt supply chains or increase the costs of certain products.\nFor the last several years, the U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a large and evolving set of amendments to its Export Administration\nRegulations that have (1) expanded the list of parties with whom we cannot do business, (2) eliminated the applicability of certain license\nexceptions for exports to countries we do business in, (3) imposed significant licensing requirements on the exports of some of our products to\nothers, and (4) imposed new restrictions on the export of commodities and technology used in development, production, and use of certain\nsemiconductor manufacturing equipment, advanced integrated circuits, and advanced computing applications. These changes have significantly\nexpanded export license requirements for U.S. companies that sell certain advanced computing and related equipment to counterparties located in or\nheadquartered in China and other countries. They have also impacted from where and from which suppliers companies like Newegg can source\ndifferent inputs for its products.\n22\nChanges in U.S. trade policy could result in one or more U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for\nus to source certain inputs for our products and to export our products to certain countries. Any of the measures outlined above can result in\nincreased costs for goods imported into the U.S. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers, which may reduce demand or, if\nwe are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on goods and services sold. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions\nimposed by the U.S. increase the price of semiconductor equipment and related parts imported into the U.S., the cost of our materials may be\nadversely affected and the demand from customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and\nprofitability. See “— Newegg’s Business Model” for more information about direct sales and marketplace.\nWe cannot predict future trade policy, the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements or additional imposed tariffs and their impact on our business.\nMoreover the evolving nature of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements\nor policies, have the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in\nturn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development\nand investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop and sell products, and any negative sentiments towards the United States\nas a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. In addition, negative sentiments towards the United States among non-U.S.\ncustomers and among non-U.S. employees or prospective employees could adversely affect sales or hiring and retention, respectively.\nEmployment laws in some of the countries in which we operate are relatively stringent.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 932 full-time employees, of whom approximately 61% were located in the United States, 32% in China, 5% in\nTaiwan, and 2% in Canada and other countries and regions. In some of the countries in which we operate, employment laws may grant significant\njob protection to employees, including rights on termination of employment and setting maximum number of hours and days per week that a\nparticular employee is permitted to work. In addition, in certain countries in which we operate, Newegg is or may be required to consult and seek\nthe advice of employee representatives and/or unions. These laws, coupled with the requirement to consult with any relevant employee\nrepresentatives and unions, could impact our ability to react to market changes and the needs of our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited and could adversely impact our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net\noperating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an\n“ownership change” occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by one or more “5% shareholders” (as defined under U.S. income tax\nlaws) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules apply under state tax laws. We believe it is possible that we\nmay experience an ownership change in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control, in which case\nwe may be limited in our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that\nwe earn. If finalized, Treasury Regulations currently proposed under Section 382 of the Code may further limit our ability to utilize our pre-change\nnet operating losses and tax credit carryforwards if we undergo such an ownership change.\nWe are treated as a U.S. corporation for all U.S. federal tax purposes.\nWe believe that we are an inverted corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. This means that, notwithstanding that we are a company incorporated\nin the BVI, we will be treated for all U.S. federal tax purposes as if we are a U.S. corporation and you will be treated for all U.S. federal tax\npurposes as holding the stock of a U.S. corporation. See “Item 10. Additional Information – E. Taxation” for additional detail.\n23\nRisks Related to our Common Shares\nA majority of Newegg’s capital shares are pledged as collateral to support delinquent indebtedness of our parent company and could be sold to\nsatisfy that indebtedness or other delinquent indebtedness of our parent company.\nThe shares of our common stock owned by Digital Grid have been pledged to Bank of China Limited Zhejiang Branch, or BOC, as collateral to\nsupport working capital loans and letters of credit provided by BOC to Hangzhou Lianluo. The loans have been guaranteed jointly and severally by\nBeijing Digital Grid Technology Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Hangzhou Lianluo, and by Mr. Zhitao He. The total principal amount owed under these\nloans as of March 31, 2024 was RMB150 million in RMB-denominated loans plus USD$66.5 million in U.S. dollar-denominated loans. In May\n2020, BOC filed several lawsuits against Hangzhou Lianluo, Digital Grid, Beijing Digital Grid Technology Co., Ltd. and Mr. Zhitao He in the\nHangzhou Intermediate People’s Court in China alleging that Hangzhou Lianluo has failed to repay the loans when due and is in breach of the loan\nagreements. The court has ruled that the loans are in default in a final, non-appealable judgment. On December 19, 2022, Digital Grid, BOC,\nNewegg, and Hangzhou Lianluo entered into a supplemental agreement (the “Supplemental Agreement”) to agree upon procedures to temporarily\nremove BOC’s lien on Digital Grid’s Newegg Common Shares to enable their sale and use of proceeds to repay BOC.\nIn addition, on April 11, 2023, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (“ICBC”) filed a lawsuit against Hangzhou Lianluo in the Hangzhou\nIntermediate People’s Court in China alleging that Hangzhou Lianluo failed to repay when due three separate loans, provided by ICBC to Hangzhou\nLianluo, and was in breach of the related loan agreements. The estimated total amount owed under the loans, including interest, fees, expenses and\npenalties, as of December 31, 2023 was approximately RMB485 million. Hangzhou Lianluo did not pledge any Common Shares owned by it or\nDigital Grid as collateral to support the ICBC loans. As disclosed by Hangzhou Lianluo on February 26, 2024, the court has ruled in a court\njudgment that Hangzhou Lianluo owed ICBC RMB332 million (including interest) under one of such loans.\nAs of the date hereof, to the best of our knowledge, no Common Shares have been sold by Hangzhou Lianluo in connection with the repayment of\nthe BOC or ICBC loans.\nSales of the Common Shares owned or pledged by Digital Grid or Hangzhou Lianluo, including for the payment of financial or settlement\nobligations to BOC or ICBC, could cause the market price of the Common Shares to drop significantly.\nBOC could sell, or force Digital Grid to sell, some or all of its shares while the BOC loans remain delinquent. Digital Grid could also choose to\nvoluntarily sell some or all of its shares at any time to satisfy the BOC or ICBC loans. Any such sale or attempted sale could:\n● Occur at a discount to our public trading price and over a short time period;\n● Result in a change of control of us to the buyer of such shares; or\n● Result in litigation over the ownership and title to those shares.\nEach of these risks could cause our share price to fall significantly and is described further below.\n● BOC could attempt to foreclose upon and sell Digital Grid’s shares in Newegg at any time. Any such sale could be done quickly and\nwithout regard for maximizing the sale price, other than to enable BOC to recover the amount of indebtedness owed to it by Hangzhou\nLianluo. In such a case, the sale price would likely be significantly less than the public trading price of our shares, which would likely\ncause our share price to fall significantly.\n● If Digital Grid sold some or all of its shares, its ownership percentage in Newegg could drop below 50%, causing it to lose control of our\nboard of directors, leading to a potential change in control of the Company. Any such change in control could be viewed negatively by our\nshareholders, leading to a drop in the trading price of our shares.\n24\n● In addition, any transfer of those shares to a non-affiliate of Digital Grid would be subject to our amended and restated shareholders\nagreement. The shareholders agreement gives a right of first refusal in favor of the Company, and a right of second refusal in favor of the\npre-merger Newegg Inc. shareholders (which primarily includes Mr. Fred Chang), to purchase some or all of the shares being transferred,\nsubject to certain exemptions. See “Item 10. Additional Information – B. Memorandum and Articles of Association – Rights of Certain\nPrincipal Shareholders – Right of First Refusal of the Company and Principal Shareholders” for additional detail. The shareholders\nagreement may not be recognized or enforceable in China’s courts, because the agreement is governed by the laws of the British Virgin\nIslands, and China courts generally do not recognize court decisions from that jurisdiction. As a result, BOC or Digital Grid could try to\nsell some or all of Digital Grid’s shares without complying with those agreements. Any such sale could result in significant litigation and\nuncertainty over the ownership of those shares, which could cause our share price to fall.\nThe market price of our common shares has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our\ncontrol.\nThe market price of our common shares has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond\nour control. These factors include, without limitation:\n● “short squeezes”;\n● comments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media;\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;\n● shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings;\n● announcements of new products and services by us or our competitors;\n● the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n● announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;\n● the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate;\n● changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n● announcements about our earnings that are not in line with shareholders’ expectations;\n● changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n● negative public perception of us, our competitors, or industry;\n● release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional equity securities;\n● potential litigation or regulatory investigations; and\n● overall general market fluctuations.\nStock markets in general and our share price in particular have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the\ntrading price of our common shares. In particular, a large proportion of our common shares has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers\nwhich has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our common shares, further influencing volatility in its market price.\nAdditionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our common shares to\nfluctuate, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their common shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our\ncommon shares.\n25\nMr. Zhitao He (as the Chairman and CEO of Hangzhou Lianluo and in his own capacity) and Mr. Fred Chang control approximately 58.7%\nand 32.9%, respectively, and 91.6%, collectively, of the voting power of our issued and outstanding common shares. They will exert significant\ninfluence on our business and operations and may have a conflict of interest with our other shareholders.\nMr. Zhitao He (as the Chairman and CEO of Hangzhou Lianluo and in his own capacity) and Mr. Fred Chang control approximately 58.7% and\n32.9%, respectively, of the voting power of our issued and outstanding common shares, and 91.6%, collectively, as of December 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, Mr. Zhitao He and Mr. Fred Chang, both of whom serve as our directors, will be able to exercise substantial influence over our\nbusiness and operations. They may also have a conflict of interest with our other shareholders. Where such a conflict exists, our other shareholders\nwill be dependent upon Mr. He, Mr. Chang, and other directors exercising, in a manner fair to all of our shareholders, their fiduciary duties. Also,\nMr. He and Mr. Chang will have the ability to control the outcome of most corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the sale of all\nor substantially all of our assets and amendments to our Memorandum and Articles of Association. Moreover, such concentration of voting power\ncould have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other business combination, which may, in turn, have an adverse\neffect on the market price of our shares or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their shares.\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate\ngovernance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nMr. Zhitao He, through Hangzhou Lianluo, Hyperfinite Galaxy Holding Limited, and Digital Grid, controls a majority of the voting power of our\noutstanding common shares. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq’s corporate governance standards. Under\nthese rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company.”\nFor so long as we remain a controlled company under this definition, we are permitted to elect to rely on certain exemptions from corporate\ngovernance rules, including:\n● an exemption from the rule that a majority of our board must be independent directors;\n● an exemption from the rule that the compensation of our chief executive officer must be determined or recommended solely by\nindependent directors; and\n● an exemption from the rule that our director nominees must be selected or recommended solely by independent directors.\nAs a result, you will not have the same protection afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to these corporate governance\nrequirements.\nThe Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association limit your ability to appoint directors and influence corporate matters and\ncould discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that minority holders of common shares may view as beneficial.\nDigital Grid and Mr. Fred Chang, who beneficially own approximately 58.7% and 32.9%, respectively, of our total voting power, have the right to\nappoint four directors and three directors, respectively, with Mr. Fred Chang acting as a “Minority Representative” selected by a majority of the\nLegacy Shareholders (as defined in the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association), who collectively own\napproximately 34.5% of our total voting power as of December 31, 2023. The number of directors that Digital Grid and the Minority Representative\nare entitled to appoint will decrease proportionately with the decrease of the respective voting power of Digital Grid and the Legacy Shareholders.\nAny director positions which neither Digital Grid nor the Minority Representative is entitled to appoint shall be appointed by the remaining\ndirectors, or by any other means allowed under the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association.\nThe Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association limit your ability to appoint or elect persons for service on our board and may\ndiscourage proxy contests for the election of directors and purchases of substantial blocks of shares by making it more difficult for a potential\nacquirer to gain control of our board.\nCertain provisions of Newegg’s Amended Shareholders Agreement may delay or prevent us from raising funding in the future and may have an\nadverse impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our common shares.\nWe are party to an amended and restated shareholders agreement (the “Amended Shareholders Agreement”) with Digital Grid, Mr. Fred Chang and\ncertain other shareholders (the “Principal Shareholders”).\nUnder the Amended Shareholders Agreement, the Principal Shareholders have pre-emptive rights to acquire additional shares when the Company\nissues or sells additional securities in the future, except for “excluded issuances” as defined in the Amended Shareholders Agreement or common\nshares offered pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC.\n26\nIn addition, the Company and the Principal Shareholders also have rights of first refusal over certain transfers of the common shares by the\nPrincipal Shareholders, pursuant to the Amended Shareholders Agreement, as amended, and subject to compliance with applicable laws and\nNasdaq’s Listing Rules. If any Principal Shareholder receives a bona fide offer from any person other than its affiliate to acquire any of the\nPrincipal Shareholder’s common shares (the “ROFR Shares”), then the Company has a right of first refusal, but not the obligation, to elect to\npurchase all (and not less than all) of the ROFR Shares, at the same price, and on the same terms and conditions offered by the purchaser (the\n“ROFR Terms”). In the event the Company does not decide to purchase all such ROFR Shares, then each of the Principal Shareholders other than\nthe selling Principal Shareholder shall have a right of first refusal to elect to purchase all (and not less than all) of its Pro Rata Share of the ROFR\nShares on the ROFR Terms; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, twenty percent (20%) of Company common shares\ncollectively held by each Principal Shareholder and its affiliates, calculated as of May 19, 2021, that are subject to any ROFR Rights shall be\nexempt from any ROFR Rights. For the purpose of the Amended Shareholders Agreement, “Pro Rata Share” means the percentage which\ncorresponds to the ratio which each selling Principal Shareholder’s “Percentage Interest” (which is calculated by dividing (i) the number of the\ncommon shares owned by such Principal Shareholder, by (ii) total number of the then outstanding shares of the common shares held by all Principal\nShareholders) bears to the total Percentage Interests of all Principal Shareholders exercising their right of first refusal. In the event that the ROFR\nShares are in exchange for non-cash consideration, then such right of first refusal shall be exercisable based on the fair market value determined in\ngood faith by the board of such non-cash consideration.\nWe may be subject to shareholder litigation due to the volatility in the price of our common shares, which may result in substantial costs and a\ndiversion of our management’s attention and resources.\nIn the past, shareholders of a public company often brought securities class action suits following periods of instability in the market price of a\ncompany’s securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management’s attention and other\nresources from our business and operations, which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the\nsuit. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition,\nif a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we may be delisted from Nasdaq, which would result in a limited public market for\ntrading our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us.\nOur common shares are traded and listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “NEGG.” However, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to\nmaintain compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirements. The Nasdaq Listing Rules require, among other things, that listed securities\nmaintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”), and failure to meet the Minimum Bid Price\nRequirement within specified compliance periods following receipt of a deficiency notice may result in delisting. For example, on November 6,\n2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, which was\nsubsequently cured on December 12, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our common stock closed at a price of $1.26 per share. If we fail to comply\nwith this, or any other, Nasdaq Listing Rule, our common shares may lose their status on Nasdaq and they would likely be traded on the over-the-\ncounter market, including the Pink Sheets market. As a result, selling our common shares could be more difficult because smaller quantities of\nshares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts’ coverage of us may not arise. In addition, in the event\nour common shares are delisted, broker dealers would bear certain regulatory burdens which may discourage broker dealers from effecting\ntransactions in our common shares and further limit the liquidity of our shares. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the\nbid and ask prices for our common shares. Such delisting from Nasdaq and continued or further declines in our common share price could also\ngreatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing and could significantly increase the ownership\ndilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions.\n27\nWe and our directors and officers may be involved in investigations or other forms of regulatory or governmental inquiry which may cause\nreputational harm to the Company, result in additional expenses, and distract our management from our day-to-day operations.\nFrom time to time, we and our directors and officers may be involved in investigations or other forms of regulatory or governmental inquiry\ncovering a range of possible issues including but not limited to securities laws compliance. See “Item 6.C. Board Practices – Involvement in\nCertain Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of current legal proceedings.\nThese inquiries or investigations could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings involving us and could result in fines, penalties,\nrestitution, other types of sanctions, or the need for us to undertake remedial actions, or to alter our business, financial or accounting practices. Our\npractice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental inquiries and investigations.\nLegal proceedings, inquiries and regulatory investigations are often unpredictable, and it is possible that the ultimate resolution of any such matters,\nif unfavorable, may be material to our results of operations in any future period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or liability imposed and\nthe operating results for the period, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any\nsuch legal proceeding, inquiry or investigation, any such matter could cause us to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and\npossibly material, to our results of operations in any future period.\nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which the common shares will trade.\nShareholders of a public company often bring securities class action suits against the company following periods of instability in the market price of\nthat company’s securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management’s attention and other\nresources from our business and operations, which could harm our results of operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the\nsuit. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition,\nif a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations\nregarding the common shares, the market price for the common shares and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the common shares could be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about our\nbusiness in the future. Currently we have one security analyst covering our company. If any additional analysts cover us in the future and\ndowngrade the common shares, the market price for the common shares would likely decline. If no additional analysts initiate coverage of us or fail\nto regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for\nthe common shares to decline.\nTechniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our common shares.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying\nidentical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between\nthe sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received\nin the sale. As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of,\nnegative opinions and allegations regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate\nprofits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks appear to have, in the past, led to selling of our shares in the market. If we\nwere to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could have to expend a\nsignificant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. We may not be able to defend against any such short seller\nattacks and may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech,\napplicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality.\n28\nInvestors may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us, our directors and management.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the BVI and many of our directors reside outside the United States. Moreover, many of these persons do not\nhave significant assets in the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon\nthese persons, or to recover against us or them on judgments of U.S. courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the\nU.S. federal securities laws.\nThe courts of the BVI would not automatically enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or our directors and officers, or some\nof the experts named herein, predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or entertain actions brought in the BVI\nagainst us or such persons predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, there is no treaty in effect between the United States and the\nBVI providing for the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, and there are grounds upon which BVI courts may\ndecline to enforce the judgments of U.S. courts. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including remedies available under\nthe U.S. federal securities laws, may not be allowed in the BVI courts if contrary to public policy in the BVI. Because judgments of U.S. courts are\nnot automatically enforceable in the BVI, it may be difficult for you to recover against us or our directors and officers based upon such judgments.\nIn addition, under PRC law, a foreign judgment, which does not otherwise violate basic legal principles, state sovereignty, safety or social public\ninterest, may be recognized and enforced by a PRC court, based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on\nprinciples of reciprocity between jurisdictions. As currently there exists no treaty or other form of reciprocity between China and the United States\nor the BVI governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments, including those predicated upon the liability provisions of the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws, there is uncertainty whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce judgments rendered by courts in the United States or the\nBVI. In addition, Taiwan does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United\nStates and the BVI. Therefore, recognition and enforcement in Taiwan of judgement of United States and BVI courts in relation to any matter not\nsubject to a binding arbitration provision would need to be enforced in accordance with common law principles.\nCertain types of class or derivative actions generally available under U.S. law may not be available as a result of the fact that we are\nincorporated in the BVI. As a result, the rights of shareholders may be limited.\nShareholders of BVI companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a court of the United States. The BVI courts are\nalso unlikely to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts in the United States based on certain liability provisions of U.S. securities law\nor to impose liabilities against us, in original actions brought in the BVI, based on certain liability provisions of U.S. securities laws that are penal in\nnature.\nYou may have more difficulty protecting your interests than you would as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation.\nOur corporate affairs will be governed by the provisions of our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time,\nand by the provisions of applicable BVI law. The rights of shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors and officers under BVI\nlaw are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the United States, and some states\n(such as Delaware) have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law.\nThese rights and responsibilities are to a large extent governed by the Companies Act and the common law of the BVI. The common law of the BVI\nis derived in part from judicial precedent in the BVI as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a\ncourt in the BVI. In addition, BVI law does not make a distinction between public and private companies and some of the protections and\nsafeguards (such as statutory pre-emption rights, save to the extent expressly provided for in the memorandum and articles of association) that\ninvestors may expect to find in relation to a public company are not provided for under BVI law.\n29\nThere may be less publicly available information about us than is regularly published by or about U.S. issuers. Also, the BVI regulations governing\nthe securities of BVI companies may not be as extensive as those in effect in the United States, and the BVI law and regulations regarding corporate\ngovernance matters may not be as protective of our shareholders as state corporation laws in the United States. Therefore, you may have more\ndifficulty protecting your interests in connection with actions taken by our directors and officers or our Principal Shareholders than you would as a\nshareholder of a corporation incorporated in the United States.\nThe laws of BVI provide limited protections for our shareholders, so our shareholders will not have the same options as to recourse in comparison\nto the United States if the shareholders are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairs.\nUnder the laws of the BVI there is limited statutory protection of our shareholders other than the provisions of the Companies Act dealing with\nshareholder remedies. The principal protections under BVI statutory law are derivative actions, actions brought by one or more shareholders for\nrelief from unfair prejudice, oppression and unfair discrimination and/or to enforce the Companies Act or the memorandum and articles of\nassociation. Shareholders are entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted in accordance with the Companies Act and the memorandum\nand articles of association, and are entitled to payment of the fair value of their respective shares upon dissenting from certain enumerated corporate\ntransactions.\nThere are common law rights for the protection of shareholders that may be invoked, largely dependent on English company law, since the common\nlaw of the BVI is limited. Under the general rule pursuant to English company law known as the rule in Foss v. Harbottle, a court will generally\nrefuse to interfere with the management of a company at the insistence of a minority of its shareholders who express dissatisfaction with the\nconduct of the company’s affairs by the majority or the board of directors. However, every shareholder is entitled to seek to have the affairs of the\ncompany conducted properly according to law and the constitutional documents of the company. As such, if those who control the company have\npersistently disregarded the requirements of company law or the provisions of the company’s memorandum and articles of association, then the\ncourts may grant relief. Generally, the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following: (i) a company is acting or proposing to act illegally\nor beyond the scope of its authority; (ii) the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could only be effected if duly\nauthorized by more than the number of votes which have actually been obtained; (iii) the individual rights of the plaintiff shareholder have been\ninfringed or are about to be infringed; or (iv) those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”\nThese rights may be more limited than the rights afforded to our shareholders under the laws of states in the United States.\nUnder the Companies Act, members of the general public, on payment of a nominal fee, can obtain copies of the public records of a company\navailable at the office of the Registrar which will include the company’s certificate of incorporation, its memorandum and articles of association\n(with any amendments) and records of license fees paid to date and will also disclose any articles of dissolution, articles of merger and a register of\ncharges if the company has elected to file such a register.\nA member of a company is entitled, on giving written notice to the company, to inspect:\na. the memorandum and articles;\nb. the register of members;\nc. the register of directors; and\nd. the minutes of meetings and resolutions of members and of those classes of members of which he is a member; and to make copies of or\ntake extracts from the documents and records referred to in (a) to (d) above.\nSubject to the memorandum and articles of association, the directors may, if they are satisfied that it would be contrary to the company’s interests to\nallow a member to inspect any document, or part of a document, specified in (b), (c) or (d) above, refuse to permit the member to inspect the\ndocument or limit the inspection of the document, including limiting the making of copies or the taking of extracts from the records. Where a\ncompany fails or refuses to permit a member to inspect a document or permits a member to inspect a document subject to limitations, that member\nmay apply to the BVI Court for an order that he or she should be permitted to inspect the document or to inspect the document without limitation.\n30\nThis may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit\nproxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.\nAs a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by our\nmanagement, members of the Board or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the United\nStates. For a discussion of significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Act and the laws applicable to companies incorporated\nin the United States and their shareholders, see “Description of Shares — Differences between the Law of Different Jurisdictions.”\nBecause we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you must rely on a price appreciation of the common shares for a return on\nyour investment.\nWe currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result,\nwe do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment in the common shares as a\nsource for any future dividend income.\nOur Board has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain requirements of BVI law. In addition, our shareholders\nmay by ordinary resolution declare a dividend, but no dividend may exceed the amount recommended by our directors. Under BVI law, a BVI\ncompany may pay a dividend out of either profit or share premium account, provided that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would\nresult in the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. Even if our Board decides to declare and pay\ndividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital\nrequirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions,\nand other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Accordingly, the return on your investment in the common shares will likely depend entirely upon\nany future price appreciation of the common shares. There is no guarantee that the common shares will appreciate in value or even maintain the\nprice at which you purchased the common shares. You may not realize a return on your investment in the common shares and you may even lose\nyour entire investment in the common shares. Additionally, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends on our common shares\nmay be limited by restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, including restrictions that are imposed\nunder the terms of the agreements governing our subsidiaries’ loan and credit facilities. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and\nif dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of such dividend.\nAs a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate\ngovernance matters that differ significantly from Nasdaq’s corporate governance listing standards. These practices may afford less protection to\nshareholders than they would enjoy if we complied fully with Nasdaq’s corporate governance listing standards.\nAs a BVI company listed on Nasdaq, we are subject to Nasdaq’s corporate governance listing standards. However, Nasdaq rules permit a foreign\nprivate issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of its home country. Certain provision in the Companies Act relating to corporate\ngovernance in the BVI, which is our home country, may differ significantly from Nasdaq’s corporate governance listing standards. We intend to\nfollow the relevant provisions in the Companies Act in lieu of the following corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq that listed companies\nmust have for as long as we qualify as a foreign private issuer: (i) a majority of independent directors; (ii) a nominating/corporate governance\ncommittee composed entirely of independent directors; and (iii) a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors. To the\nextent we choose to follow home country practice in the future, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would enjoy\nunder Nasdaq’s corporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\n31\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions\napplicable to U.S. domestic public companies.\nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations\nin the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:\n● the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K;\n● the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under\nthe Exchange Act;\n● the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and trading activities and liability for\ninsiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and\n● the rules under Regulation FD governing selective disclosure rules of material nonpublic information.\nWe are and will continue to be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we\nintend to publish our results on a semi-annual basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Press releases\nrelating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file\nwith or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a\nresult, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic\nissuer.\nItem 4. Information on the Company\nA.

Our Direct\noffering allows brands to sell directly to us and we manage the inventory and transaction directly with our consumers. Our Marketplace offering\nallows brands to leverage our platform, buyer audience and e-commerce solutions in order to generate sales on the Newegg platform.\nB. Business Overview\nThe Newegg Ecosystem\nFounded in 2001, we have developed a technology-focused e-commerce ecosystem that enables all of our participants to discover, engage and\ntransact with each other. We take pride in connecting customers to a wide and increasing selection of technology products and a large range of\nbrands, sellers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and third-party service providers.\n32\nWe have developed a powerful online marketplace that delivers value to consumers, brands and sellers in the technology products sector. Our new\nproduct and service introductions are aimed at continually improving our value proposition to these key constituents of our ecosystem and\nmarketplace. For consumers, on the demand side, we provide access to a vast, yet curated selection of technology products sourced globally. On the\nsupply side, we create value for brand partners, Marketplace sellers and suppliers by connecting them to one of the largest audiences of technology\nproduct consumers online. Additionally, our platforms offer a comprehensive suite of e-commerce solutions, including product listing, fulfillment,\nmarketing, customer service and other value-added tools and services.\nKey Ecosystem Participants and How We Create Value for Them\nThere are three key participants of our ecosystem: customers, Marketplace sellers, and brand partners.\nCustomers\nWe have built a large, highly engaged and loyal customer base. As of December 31, 2023, we had over 2.5 million active customers, defined as a\nunique customer ID with at least one item purchased on our platforms in the past 12 months.\nOur core customers include both our business-to-consumer (“B2C”) customers and our business-to-business (“B2B”) customers. See “Our Business\nModels” for more information about our B2C and B2B businesses.\nWe believe that we offer the following compelling value propositions to our customers:\n● Wide range of technology-focused products. With approximately 6.2 million SKUs and 1,595 categories as of December 31, 2023, we are\nviewed by our customers as a one-stop shop for a vast selection of technology products, ranging from brand-name IT/CE products and in-\nhouse brands of computer hardware to peripherals under our private labels. Our extensive product offerings enable us to meet the diverse\nneeds of a group of sophisticated customers, which is difficult for brick-and-mortar retailers to match due to shelf space constraints.\n● Data-driven shopping experience.\no Content-rich, user-friendly interface. Our platforms are user-friendly and easy to navigate, with features enabling customers to easily\ndiscover new products and trends, such as intelligent product recommendations and curated, personalized content supported by data\nand analytics. We also empower customers to make informed purchasing decisions by offering customized, AI-enabled shopping\nfeatures, such as an AI shopping assistant and a PC builder which leverages AI to understand a customer’s intended system design\nconfiguration, detailed product information, customer opinions, peer reviews, product tutorials and the opportunity to network with\nother members of the Newegg community. We operate in-house video production that generates original content to engage and inform\ncustomers, and we continue to enhance these capabilities in order to produce more and better content. Our platforms also provide an\nextensive portfolio of user-generated content, including over 4.8 million reviews as of December 31, 2023.\n33\no Timely, secure and reliable fulfillment. Leveraging our reliable logistics network and infrastructure, we are able to maintain a high\nlevel of shipping accuracy and reliability and timely delivery. See also “— Logistics and Fulfillment.” As of December 31, 2023, we\nachieved, for orders directly fulfilled by us, an over 99.9% average delivery accuracy rate, which is a measure of orders that are\ndelivered with the correct contents and to the correct address as a percentage of total orders, a 95.8% one-business day fulfillment rate\nin the United States and Canada if ordered prior to our 2:00 p.m. local time order cut-off, and a 98.8% two-business day fulfillment\nrate in the United States and Canada.\n● Vibrant community of tech-savvy customers. While expanding our range of product offerings, we continue to maintain a large and vibrant\ncommunity of tech-savvy customers, providing inspiration for visitors to discover new technology trends and products and valuable\ndecision-making intelligence typically not found at traditional retailers. We have continued to offer additional functionalities to foster this\ncommunity by operating Newegg Media Services, which produces Unbox This, Newegg Live, and many other original video and editorial\ncontent platforms, where like-minded technology enthusiasts can get information about Newegg and technology products.\n● Competitive Offerings.\no Competitive Pricing. We are able to offer competitive pricing across a broad range of categories because of our scale, strong supplier\nand Marketplace seller relationships, and our ability to maintain a cost-efficient infrastructure. Our experienced product management\nteam leverages data to cost-effectively match demand with supply, minimize inventory and reduce infrastructure costs associated with\nbrick-and-mortar retailers. We are also able to find optimized pricing points by leveraging our data and analytics capabilities and by\nmonitoring our major competitors’ pricing trends.\no Flexible payment options. We accept a variety of payment options and have sought to add new payment methods to cater to the needs\nof our customers. We also offer open-term accounts for business and public sector customers. For example, in response to increasing\ncustomer demand, we introduced Bitcoin payment solution in 2014 and Apple Pay in 2016. In late 2020, we also started offering a\nPay-in-4 program, where customers are given the freedom and flexibility to spread their payment in four interest-free installments. See\nalso “— Payment.”\nMarketplace Sellers\nOn our Newegg Marketplace, third-party sellers offer their products to our customers through our platforms and pay us commissions on their sales.\nSee “— Our Business Models — Marketplace” for more details. Our Newegg Marketplace has over 8,000 sellers, approximately 6.1 million SKUs\nand over 1,500 categories as of December 31, 2023.\nWe are a business enabler for our Newegg Marketplace sellers in many ways. We believe that our Marketplace sellers choose to partner with us not\njust because we offer a large online sales channel, but also because we deliver the following additional value:\n● Scaled access to technology-focused consumers. Our Marketplace connects sellers, whether brand owners or retailers, to a large and\ngrowing customer base, the majority of whom are tech-savvy, in more than 20 countries and regions as of December 31, 2023, without\nexpanding their physical footprint. In 2023, approximately 1.0 million active customers purchased $369.7 million in gross merchandise\nvalue from our Marketplace business. In addition to consumers, our Newegg Marketplace also provides smaller vendors and retailers with\naccess to profitable B2B opportunities that would otherwise be difficult to reach due to the challenges associated with providing\nspecialized support for business’ purchasing needs.\n● Access to premium e-commerce solutions. Sellers generally face high barriers entering the e-commerce market, including logistics and\nscalable economics. Our Marketplace addresses these challenges by providing sellers with a comprehensive suite of e-commerce solutions,\nincluding an API-enabled portal, on-site promotions, a curated marketing program, and fulfillment and delivery services. Particularly, we\nprovide Marketplace sellers with valuable data insights, which help them to market their products more effectively, generate additional\ntraffic and increase conversion.\n● Human touch. Our Marketplace is a key component of our ecosystem. Since we launched our Marketplace model in 2010, we have\ncarefully nurtured our relationships with Marketplace sellers and have invested in their success, which we believe drives our continued\ngrowth in the long run. For example, we assign dedicated account managers to qualified sellers to help them tackle the variety of\nchallenges associated with operating a virtual storefront.\n34\nBrand Partners\nWe are a trusted partner and a go-to channel for many leading technology product brands and are increasingly establishing partnerships with brands\nin a growing number of adjacent product categories. As of December 31, 2023, we sourced merchandise from over 2,580 brand partners for our\ndirect sales business, and featured the official online stores of a number of brand partners, including some of the most well-known brands such as\nAMD, Asus, Gigabyte, HP, Intel, Lenovo, Meta Quest, Microsoft, MSI, Nvidia, and Samsung.\nWe provide the following benefits for our brand partners:\n● Access to a targeted customer base. Enabling brands to cost-effectively reach target audiences, our existing, loyal customer base is highly\nvalued by companies targeting ready-to-buy, tech-savvy customers as well as foreign brands seeking to sell products and build brand\nawareness in the markets we serve.\n● Comprehensive and cost-efficient distribution channel. Leveraging Newegg’s customer-friendly online platforms, established logistics\nnetwork and infrastructure and extensive e-commerce experience and expertise, we offer to our brand partners comprehensive and cost-\nefficient distribution channels and comprehensive supply chain capabilities, including marketing, warehousing, fulfillment and customer\nservice.\n● Brand building and promotion solutions. We offer our brand partners solutions and support to run special promotions and targeted\nmarketing and brand-building campaigns through our platforms utilizing data and interactive media in ways that cannot be achieved\nthrough traditional media. See “— Our Business Models — Marketing Services.”\n● Data insights. We collect insights from our customers’ interactions on the platform using our data and analytics capabilities. We use these\ninsights, coupled with customer feedback and our knowledge of the e-commerce market, to facilitate our brand partners’ product and\nmarketing decision-making.\nOur Business Models\nOur primary business model is to help customers find and purchase their desired products through our platforms. From a customer base and target\naudience perspective, we categorize our business model into B2C and B2B operations. We strive to offer a compelling online shopping experience,\nreliable and timely order fulfilment and superior customer service across our B2C and B2B operations through our Direct sales, Marketplace and\nNPS platforms.\nThe following chart sets forth our business models:\n35\n\nB2C\nWe have maintained a B2C business since launching our e-commerce platform in 2001. With a focus on selling IT/CE products, our B2C business\nhas expanded to include an increasingly wide range of products. Our selection spans emerging technology categories such as virtual reality, video\ngame consoles and digital games catering to the e-sports segment, wearable devices for health and fitness enthusiasts, home appliances and smart\nhome automation solutions, as well as software, networking equipment, gaming accessories, home office furniture, headphones and portable\ndevices, home video systems, cell phones, home audio, and surveillance products.\nOur B2C customers consist primarily of sophisticated IT professionals, gamers, do-it-yourself technology enthusiasts and early technology adopters\nwho generally occupy a well-educated, affluent, and IT trendsetting demographic with relatively high purchase frequency and strong willingness to\nembrace technology trends and try new products. We believe our success is built upon our ability to cater to the preferences, tastes and habits of this\ndemographic. As of December 31, 2023, we served customers in the United States, Canada and over 20 additional countries and regions through our\nNewegg.com, Newegg.ca and Newegg Global platforms. For details of these platforms, see “— Our Platforms — B2C Platforms.” Our B2C\noperations generated GMV of $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nB2B\nWith a focus on providing office and IT equipment, NeweggBusiness.com offers our B2B customers access to our extensive product assortment and\naccount managers with expertise in sourcing technology for business and processing industry specific requirements. Our B2B operations generated\nGMV of $325.6 million and $379.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur B2B customers span across a range of verticals, including healthcare providers, K-12 and higher educational institutions, government agencies,\nand businesses of all sizes, and our B2B operations have been focused on providing specialized support for their industry- and business-specific\nneeds.\nCurrently, while we position NeweggBusiness.com as our dedicated B2B website, a significant number of our B2B customers also shop via our\naccount managers, or on our flagship retail platform, Newegg.com. See “— Our Platforms — B2B Platforms” for more information about these\nplatforms.\nHow We Deliver Our Service\nWe sell products to our B2C and B2B businesses through direct sales and Marketplace.\nWe believe that the integration of our direct sales and Marketplace operations has created a virtuous, self-reinforcing cycle. Our Marketplace is built\non the success of our direct sales business, and we believe that many sellers are attracted to our Marketplace by our direct sales credentials. On the\nother hand, as we continue to source new products and recruit quality sellers, the choices available to customers also should increase, generating\nmomentum for our growth. We believe that this self-reinforcement, coupled with our reliable logistics network, has made it a top online destination\nfor IT/CE products.\nDirect Sales\nWe acquire products directly from our partners that consist of manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers, and sell them directly to our B2C and\nB2B customers. For our direct sales, we generally source the products, take inventory risk, process customer payments, prepare packages for\nshipment and delivery, and provide customer service and support. We stock and ship from our own warehouses, and also drop-ship directly to\ncustomers from our partners’ warehouses.\n36\nDirect sales is a significant driver of our business, generating approximately 74.2% of our GMV for the year ended December 31, 2023. The\nsuccess of our direct sales business depends largely upon our ability to secure a broad selection of products from suppliers at competitive costs.\nSince the commencement of our operations, we have sought and cultivated deep, longstanding relationships with some of the biggest IT brands in\nthe world and many of the largest, most important IT distributors. We continuously seek to build similar relationships with suppliers in new and\nemerging categories and geographies. Due to our strong supplier relationships and our purchasing volume, we are able to obtain favorable pricing,\nearly allocation of new products, preferential allocation of products in shortage, and funding for product promotion and cooperative marketing. We\nalso enjoy exclusive arrangements with certain suppliers where we are able to offer highly demanded products exclusively on our platforms. For\nmore information about merchandise sourced for direct sales, see “— Merchandise Sourcing.”\nMarketplace\nOur Marketplace operations enable customers to discover and purchase products from qualified third-party sellers from over 40 countries and\nregions globally as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our Marketplace consisted of over 3,100 active sellers based in the United\nStates, over 3,900 active sellers based in China, and over 900 active sellers coming from other countries. Our Marketplace sellers pay us\ncommissions on their sales, with published commission rates varying from 8% to 15% according to product category. We also charge membership\nfees for the additional value-added services and tools that we provide to sellers based on their enrollment.\nOur Marketplace operations consist of the Newegg Marketplace that launched in 2010, the Newegg B2B Marketplace, and the Newegg Canada\nMarketplace that launched in 2014. As of December 31, 2023, our Marketplace connected B2C and B2B customers to over 8,000 third-party sellers\noffering approximately 6.1 million SKUs. Our Marketplace offers a variety of product categories, including emerging smart home automation, VR,\nlifestyle electronics, health and beauty technology products and houses online stores of some of the most well-known brands in the technology\nindustry, such as Dyson and Lenovo.\nWhile we encourage Marketplace sellers to offer the most attractive prices, they have the flexibility to price the products sold through our\nMarketplace. Due to our partnership, unique customer base, scale and large visitor traffic, some of the Marketplace sellers also set aside exclusive\noffers, promotion, and product supplies for us and offer some of the best offers tailored specifically to our customers. We have a rigorous process in\nplace to assess our Marketplace sellers. We select Marketplace sellers based on a number of factors, including service level, logistics capability,\noperational efficiency, category focus, sales volume, brand assortment, customer rating and market reputation. We also require third-party sellers to\nmeet our strict standards and protocols in terms of product authenticity, customer service, and delivery and fulfillment so that customers are\nconfident that they receive the same level of buying experience and customer service that they expect when buying directly from us. To help deliver\na high-quality customer experience, we utilize a variety of quality control and fraud prevention techniques in order to identify and remove non-\nconforming products and sellers from our Marketplace. See also “— Customer Service and Support — Marketplace monitoring.”\nMerchandise Sourcing\nAs of December 31, 2023, we offered approximately 6.2 million SKUs across our platforms, consisting of over 103,100 direct sales SKUs sourced\nfrom at least 330 suppliers globally and approximately 6.1 million SKUs on our Marketplace from over 8,000 third-party sellers globally. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 60.6% of our direct sales inventory was purchased directly from manufacturers, 36.7% from distributors and\n2.7% from other sources. As of December 31, 2023, the 10 largest suppliers, whom we have worked with for over a decade, accounted for 71% of\nthe merchandise we purchased for direct sales.\nThe table below shows our major product categories offered through our platforms and their selected featured brands:\nCategory Products Selected Featured Brands\nComputer System Desktops, laptops, gaming laptops, peripherals and Asus, MSI, HP, Lenovo, Acer, Microsoft, Samsung, LG,\naccessories Gigabyte, Logitech\nComponents CPU/processors, graphic cards, motherboards, storage Intel, AMD, Asus, MSI, Corsair, Gigabyte,\ndevices and computer accessories ASRock, Western Digital, Seagate, Samsung, G.Skill\nOthers Software, virtual reality, gaming consoles, networking, Meta, PlayStation, Samsung, Dyson, Netgear, LG,\ndigital games, home appliances, gaming desks/chairs and Nintendo, H&R Block, Adobe\nTVs\n37\nWe strive for a steady supply of products and optimized pricing and allocation, and as a result, we maintain multiple sourcing arrangements for\nmost of our products. Leveraging our scale, brand and global footprint, we seek to enter into exclusive agreements with selected suppliers and third-\nparty distributors for some or all of their products with favorable terms.\nWe deploy a flexible sourcing model, utilizing different distribution channels when economically and logistically beneficial while maintaining our\nreseller authorizations and relationships with our brand partners. As we increase in scale in new or emerging product categories, we endeavor to\nincrease our purchases directly from manufacturers and, where appropriate, to become an authorized reseller, which we believe provides improved\nproduct pricing and better access to preferred product allocation.\nOur technology savvy customer base, our online marketing and merchandising expertise and our ability to quickly and efficiently launch new\nproducts make us the go-to channel for many manufacturers and distributors. We are particularly strong in the components categories where we are\none of the largest channels online or offline and we continue to gain significant traction with suppliers in other categories, such as desktop PCs,\nlaptops, and input/output devices.\nWe maintain extensive and longstanding relationships with many of the biggest technology product brands and distributors globally. We employ a\nteam of merchandising professionals specifically trained to cultivate and manage relationships with large international IT brands, such as AMD,\nAsus, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft, MSI, Nvidia, and Samsung. Our merchandising professionals review our product categories and brands on a regular\nbasis to assess demand and trends so that we offer our customers access to the most current and desirable products.\nPrivate Labels\nWe currently offer two private label brands on Newegg.com: Rosewill, which is focused on offering computer components and accessories, gaming\nperipherals and home electronics, and ABS, which offers high-end gaming PCs for consumers, on Newegg.com. We leverage our data and insights\nfrom customers and activity on the platform to determine products and features to focus our investment. Our private label assortment is primarily\nfocused around categories where we believe that we can compete at higher than average margins while delivering cost effective, high quality\noptions to our customers. We offer our Rosewill and ABS products across our platforms and on other e-commerce platforms, such as Walmart,\nAmazon, and eBay.\nOther Services and Solutions\nIn addition to online retail sales, we also generate revenues from a range of ancillary value-added partner services. We believe by providing these\nservices, we create additional value for our business partners and customers and ultimately benefit our ecosystem and all its participants.\nSupply Chain Third-party (3PL) Services\n● Shipped by Newegg® Service. We began to offer Shipped by Newegg, a comprehensive suite of warehousing and fulfillment services, to\nour Marketplace sellers in 2013. Enrolled Newegg Marketplace sellers deliver their products to one of our fulfillment centers, and we\nhandle the fulfillment of orders placed in the sellers’ online stores and charge service fees based on the size of the products and the\nshipping methods requested.\n● Newegg Logistics. We launched Newegg Logistics in 2014, a division dedicated to providing end-to-end e-commerce logistics and supply\nchain solutions covering warehousing, inventory management, order processing, packing, and shipping, designed to reduce inventory costs\nand streamline supply chain efficiencies, to our business partners, manufacturers, whole-sellers, Marketplace sellers and B2B clients.

To address our clients’ concerns in managing\ncustomer returns, we customize a cost-effective reverse logistics solution catered to their businesses. Our solutions range from small parcel\ndelivery to Less Than Truckload, heavy freight, and all the way up to intermodal transport and cross-border shipping, with easy access to\nroad, rail, water, and air transport. We typically enter into a master service agreement with our Newegg Logistics customers and charge\nservice fees at a fixed rate.\n38\n● Newegg Staffing: We launched Newegg Staffing in 2020 with a focus on providing both direct placement and seasonal placement of\nemployees to help our partners, offering clerical, manufacturing, and logistics employee placement. Clients such as vendor partners utilize\nthese services as a one-stop shop solution for all their business needs.\nMarketing Services\nIn 2020, we began rolling out the first of our marketing services for Newegg Marketplace sellers. We offer flexible marketing packages consisting\nof advertising sales, event organization, and other marketing campaigns to our brand partners. We help brands reach a potential audience by\nleveraging our online portals, marketing affiliates and promotional emails. We help our brand partners and Marketplace sellers design marketing\nactivities with highly effective cost of sales. In addition, our Newegg Media team also provides social media and video content service offerings to\nmarket our brand partners to millions of social fans across various internet platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, X, YouTube and Instagram\nthrough live stream shopping, video content, and engaging social posts by offering promotions, sweepstakes, and reviews in order to maximize our\nbrand partners’ exposure.\nOur Platforms\nOur websites and mobile applications, which we refer to as the “Newegg platforms,” are the foundation of our ecosystem. While each Newegg\nplatform is strategically focused on different market segments, customers and/or product categories, the platforms share a common Newegg brand\nand are supported by our integrated logistics and fulfillment capability, operational expertise and technology infrastructure, and we offer the same\nlevel of customer service and dedication across all these platforms.\nB2C Platforms\n● Newegg.com. Launched in 2001 in the United States, Newegg.com is our first online platform and currently our flagship e-commerce\nplatform. Newegg.com offers a typical range of IT/CE categories with the continuous addition of emerging categories such as virtual\nreality, video game consoles and digital games catering to the e-sports segment, wearable devices for health and fitness enthusiasts, home\nappliances and smart home automation solutions, as well as software, networking equipment, gaming accessories, home office furniture,\nheadphones and portable devices, home video systems, cell phones, home audio and surveillance products. While Newegg.com operates\npredominantly as a B2C e-commerce platform, Newegg.com supports both direct sales, where we sell merchandise directly to customers,\nand the Marketplace model where third-party sellers offer their inventory to our customers. As of December 31, 2023, Newegg.com\nfulfilled orders originating from various countries, mostly in North America.\n● Newegg.ca. We launched Newegg.ca in 2008 to sell IT/CE products in Canada with a business model similar to that of Newegg.com.\nNewegg.ca is a leading e-commerce platform focusing on IT/CE products in Canada, with approximately 2.0 million registered accounts,\nand GMV of $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $159.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Currently,\nnearly half of orders on Newegg.ca are fulfilled from our warehouses. We also deliver to our Canadian customers via Shipped by Newegg\nor other third-party shipping companies. Orders for merchandise offered by Canada-based Marketplace sellers are fulfilled locally by such\nsellers in Canada as well.\n● Newegg Global. We launched Newegg Global in 2017 to expand our footprint in the global e-commerce market. Newegg Global currently\nfulfills orders originating from 20 countries or regions. Newegg Global had over 1.2 million registered customers outside North America as\nof December 31, 2023.\n● Mobile apps. Since the launch of our first mobile app in 2008, we have accumulated millions of downloads of our mobile apps. We\ncurrently have a mobile app for Apple devices and for Android devices, and we launch updated versions of our apps periodically. We have\nalso developed live-streaming shopping features that enable our customers to engage in real time product discovery through media\nchannels such as Newegg Live and TikTok. For more details, see “— Technology — Our IT Capability — Mobile site and apps.”\n39\nB2B Platforms\nIn 2009, we launched NeweggBusiness.com, a site that currently supports substantially all of our B2B operations. Over the years, we have built\nNeweggBusiness.com into a dedicated B2B e-commerce platform offering a full range of IT, office and industrial products and solutions with a\nwide customer base ranging from government agencies, healthcare institutions, and education institutions to other businesses of all sizes.\nNeweggBusiness.com supports both direct sales and a B2B Marketplace that connects our B2B customers with over 1,680 third-party sellers\nglobally.\nOther Platforms\nIn addition to the major Newegg platforms discussed above, we also operate Newegglogistics.com, a platform dedicated to providing reliable\nlogistics and supply chain solutions through 3PL operations. For details of Newegg’s 3PL services, see “— Our Business Models — Supply Chain\nThird-party (3PL) Services.”\nLogistics and Fulfillment\nWe have a reliable logistics network and infrastructure designed to prioritize timely and accurate shipment of large quantities of orders. This has\nallowed us to deliver over 22,850 parcels per day on average, with an average accuracy rate of over 99.9%, a 95.8% one-business day fulfillment\nrate in the United States and Canada if ordered prior to our 2:00 p.m. local time order cut-off and a 98.8% two-business day fulfillment rate in the\nUnited States and Canada, as of December 31, 2023.\nWe stock and ship the vast majority of our direct sales products. Fulfillment of orders from our Marketplace is executed by the sellers except for\norders shipped through our Shipped by Newegg services, where the items will be shipped from one of our warehouses.\nOur logistics and fulfillment infrastructure and capabilities include:\n● Warehouses. We believe the best approach in serving our customers is to maintain reasonable inventory levels and to ship directly from our\nown inventory. As of December 31, 2023, we operated seven strategically located fulfillment centers, including six warehouses located in\nNorth America and one in China, covering more than 1.5 million square feet in total. We maintain regional warehouses in Southern\nCalifornia, Indiana, Georgia, and Ontario, Canada to fulfill customer orders in the United States and Canada. The geographical placement\nof our warehouses in North America enables us to reach approximately 96% of the North American population in two business days.\n● Cooperation with reliable logistics service providers. We capitalize on a robust transportation framework that connects international air and\nsea transport, domestic over-the-road carriers, and last-mile delivery to residential consumers such as United States Postal Service,\nPurolator, and UPS. We have also engaged and are working with multiple logistics partners to offer a wide array of flexible delivery\noptions.\n● Virtual fulfillment. We ship certain products to customers directly from vendors and distributors who meet our quality fulfillment standards\nwithout going through our warehouses, a practice which we refer to as virtual fulfillment. Virtual fulfillment is fully utilized to broaden our\nproduct assortment and avoid loss of sales when SKUs are out of stock. In the United States, virtual fulfillment accounted for\napproximately 8.4% of direct sales for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur logistics and fulfillment focus on reliable, efficient, and flexible delivery.\n● Reliability. We have a reliable technology platform and order process for our fulfillment operation. Each order is verified at least twice\nbefore being shipped. Customers can track the shipping status of their purchases through links to our email and/or our websites and mobile\napplications. Our inventory management and tracking also have redundant capabilities to enable each facility, if necessary, to fulfill most\nof our direct orders. This redundancy could allow us to continually fulfill most orders, albeit less efficiently, as long as a single warehouse\nis operational.\n40\n● Efficiency. We have a well-designed, fully customized, warehousing management software system that is adopted by all warehouses,\nfeaturing smart categorization of inventory assortment in various warehouse locations to maximize logistics efficiency. When we order\nproduct from a supplier, we track the receipt of the merchandise and can “material optimize,” or direct, the inventory to a specific\nwarehouse to match customer demand in a geographical area; when a purchase order is received, we match the order to our inventory and\ndistribute a specific order fulfillment assignment to one or more warehouses for processing. We use automated warehouse order fulfillment\nsystems, such as “Goods-to-Person” (GTP) picking and “Autonomous Mobile Robot” (AMR) robotic picking to allow our warehouse staff\nto fulfill orders efficiently.\n● Flexibility. Our customers may choose from various date options for order delivery, for which our system will select the most economical\nshipping method, from basic ground shipping to expedited overnight shipping, to meet our delivery commitment. We have continuously\noptimized our available delivery options to upgrade the shopping experience of our customers.\nCustomer Service and Support\nWe have built our brand on the principle of superior customer service. We provide high-quality customer service and support throughout our\ncustomers’ entire engagement with us, from purchase to returns.\n● Customer service. Our in-house customer service staff are trained to resolve customers’ inquiries as quickly as possible. We currently\noperate customer service centers in California and Texas, focusing on serving North American buyers. Our customer service\nrepresentatives are available by phone, live-chat, chatbot or email. We have also been making investments in artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning technologies, such as ChatGPT, to enhance our chatbot functionality and better serve our customers.\n● Marketplace monitoring. When customers purchase items from our Marketplace sellers, we make them confident that they receive the\nsame level of customer service they expect from our direct sales. With that in mind, we closely monitor the performance of our\nMarketplace sellers to monitor compliance with Newegg Marketplace rules, have a reliable logistics network, provide customers with\nquality customer support, ship orders on time, and respond to customer queries in a timely fashion. We have adopted a zero-tolerance\npolicy on counterfeit products and have rules in place to take down allegedly counterfeit or pirated products and disqualify sellers selling\ncounterfeit or pirated products. For more information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Newegg’s Business — Our reputation and\nbusiness may be harmed if we or our Marketplace sellers sell pirated, counterfeit, illegal or “gray market” items.”\n● Newegg Marketplace Guarantee service. We also offer a special customer service program, Newegg Marketplace Guarantee, for\nMarketplace orders. With Newegg Marketplace Guarantee, if a Marketplace seller fails to reimburse the customer for products that are\ndamaged, defective, not received by customer, or materially different from what was displayed on our platform by that seller, the customer\ncan submit a claim directly to us and may be eligible for reimbursement of the purchase price of any product they purchase from a Newegg\nMarketplace seller.\n● Return policy. Our standard “Hassle Free” return policy generally allows most items that are directly sold and shipped by us to be returned\nwithin 30 days of the delivery date for a full refund or replacement. Restocking fees are waived for all items.\nFrom a customer service perspective, in addition to customers, we broadly define our customers to also include our Marketplace sellers, from whom\nwe earn commissions, and purchasers of our 3PL services and other ancillary e-commerce solutions and services. See “— The Newegg Ecosystem\n— Key Ecosystem Participants and How We Create Value for Them — Marketplace Sellers” and “— Our Business Models — Supply Chain Third-\nparty (3PL) Services” for more information about our engagement with these customers.\nPayment\nWe provide our customers with the flexibility to choose from a number of traditional online payment options, along with certain alternative payment\nsolutions that are popular with our predominantly technology-enthusiast customers.\n● B2C payment options. We offer various mainstream online payment options to customers on our B2C platform, including credit cards,\ndebit cards and prepaid gift cards. We offer customers the opportunity to pay for items purchased on our platforms with the Newegg Store\nCredit Card, a private-label credit card that Newegg launched in partnership with Synchrony Financial, a U.S. consumer financial services\ncompany. Newegg Store Credit Card has a revolving credit line and offers numerous attractive financing options, which we believe\nimproves customer loyalty and purchase frequency and results in increased sales. We also allow customers to use Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash,\nand other cryptocurrencies to pay for purchases made on our platforms through our third-party payment service provider, BitPay, who\nconverts and settles all transactions to U.S. dollars in real time. In late 2020, we started offering “Pay in 4” payment option that allows\ncustomers to pay in four interest-free installments within a six-week timeframe. This payment option is offered through Zip. We also allow\nour customers to pay at their own pace for up to a period of 24 months through Affirm.\n41\n● B2B payment options. B2B customers can make payment during checkout or request credit and pay on terms via the above-mentioned\nonline payment options or via ACH, wire transfer, or bank check. We also offer open-term accounts for business and public sector\ncustomers. In most cases, the payment term that we grant to our B2B customers is 30 days.\nSales and Marketing\nOur marketing strategy includes generating customer traffic, increasing our brand recognition, acquiring customers cost-efficiently, building\ncustomer loyalty and maximizing repeat purchases. Our integrated marketing framework represents a core competency that we regard as essential to\nthe success of our platforms. We are focused on continuing to enhance our brand awareness through a variety of online and offline marketing and\nbrand promotion activities, while leveraging technology to drive scalability and sustainability and eventually achieve optimal return on investment\nand highly effective cost of traffic as well as sales.\nReferral\nWe benefit significantly from word-of-mouth referrals and positive product reviews, and we believe our reputation as a one-stop–technology shop\nhas led to strong word-of-mouth promotion, especially among the technology-savvy. We have efficient customer acquisition strategies, because the\nmajority of our web traffic is free. Free traffic includes mobile apps, email & SMS, social media, and brand mentions, reviews and shares. Paid\ntraffic includes affiliate marketing, sponsorships, influences, connected TV, and paid searches. In 2023, 90% of traffic was free, as compared to the\npaid traffic of 10%.\nOnline Marketing\nWe conduct the majority of our marketing efforts online through targeted marketing via affiliates, search engines, promotional emails, social media\ntraffic, targeting and personalization, and online promotion campaigns.\n● Paid search engine marketing. Search engine marketing is an important driver of our traffic and customer acquisition. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, our spending on paid search engine marketing represented approximately 57% of our total marketing spending and\n5% of total traffic to Newegg’s websites, including desktop, mobile, and app traffic. We bid for specific keywords and products on search\nengine sites, such as Google and Microsoft Bing, for optimum visibility in the displayed results. Our broad and evolving product selection\nenables us to utilize a large quantity of keywords that we frequently test and measure for their effectiveness. We also use sophisticated\nsoftware to strategically manage our keyword and SKU-level bids to maximize marketing performance at an efficient rate.\n● Affiliate marketing. We also engage in affiliate marketing programs where we offer affiliated websites commissions for sales resulting\nfrom directing customer traffic to our websites through embedded hyperlinks. Such affiliates are typically deal sites that advertise retailer\ndeals to their audiences. Affiliate marketing is our second largest paid marketing channel and represents approximately 32% of our total\nmarketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n● Personalized email marketing efforts and customer retargeting. Our personalized email marketing efforts and customer retargeting\nstrategies are based on customers’ on-site behavioral data and purchase history data. Whether customers are undertaking a project, seeking\ndeals, or simply exploring, we tailor our targeted emails to align with their specific needs and interests.\n● Other online marketing channels. Other online marketing channels include click-through based advertising on publishers’ sites, targeted\nmessages, email distribution, banner advertisements on high-traffic portals, social networking via major social media sites and our own\nbranded portal, and onsite promotions and cross-selling opportunities on our websites.\n42\nOffline Marketing\nWe also devote marketing resources to various offline formats, including hosting or exhibiting at live events, including trade shows, conferences\nand various industry and consumer networking events.\nTechnology\nOur technology systems are a critical component of our success and designed to enhance efficiency and scalability. Our research and development\nteam, coupled with our proprietary technology infrastructure and the large volume of data generated and collected on our platforms, has created\nopportunities for continuous improvements in our technology capabilities, empowering reliability, scalability, and flexibility. Our technology\nstrategy is to develop our own proprietary software and license technologies from third parties as appropriate in order to simplify and improve the\nshopping experience, as well as facilitate our fulfillment, financial and customer service operations.\nIT Infrastructure\nWe have built our technology platform by relying primarily on software and systems that we have developed in-house and, to a lesser extent, on\nthird-party software. Our technology infrastructure is designed for scalability and reliability to support business growth. We utilize high-availability\nclusters comprising groups of servers to provide sufficient redundancy and maintain continued service in the event of single point server failure due\nto hostile attacks, systematic errors or other reasons. Our high-availability data system is designed so that back-up servers instantly connect to our\nnetwork once master servers experience technical difficulties.\nWe currently have one company-owned data center in City of Industry, California and three co-location data centers at facilities in Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, and New Jersey to provide redundancy for our e-commerce data. We maintain approximately 1,242 servers stored in our data centers and\napproximately 268 network devices. Our IT infrastructure enables us to support over 90 million page views per day and provides the capability to\nprocess up to 0.93 million orders per day. Our platform obtained PCI Level 1 certification in 2010.\nOur IT Capability\n● Websites. Our website incorporates proprietary technology internally developed on a primarily Microsoft.NET platform. It provides\nproduct descriptions, search and ordering functionalities, and product reviews.\n● Mobile site and apps. Customer activity on mobile devices is growing, and we are investing significantly in mobile technology to increase\nsales to customers using mobile devices. Our mobile app aims to create a convenient shopping experience for our customers by, for\nexample, enabling users to save their profiles and payment information for future purchases.\n● Data and analytics. Data collected from our operations, including inventory data, behavioral and transactional data and pricing data, are\nhoused in our data centers. We have deployed commercial business intelligence software to analyze this data and improve the shopping\nexperience. We apply various AI capabilities and deep learning technologies across our platforms to enhance the shopping experience. Our\nsophisticated user behavior analysis system leverages our large customer database to create customized product recommendations,\nallowing us to efficiently acquire new customers and increase sales. Also, we have leveraged our AI capabilities to allow category\nextraction for different products based on the unstructured content and images, the results of which have been used to provide\nmiscategorization correction and site search relevancy improvement.\n● Inventory management. Our supply chain management system includes price optimization, inventory balancing, and inventory\nforecasting and other subsystems. It enables effective sales forecasting and inventory management that increases the efficiency of our\nsupply chain and helps us control costs. Our inventory availability is coordinated through our technology platform. We have added\nfunctionality to update our platforms on a real-time basis when items become out of stock in our fulfillment centers. This feature limits the\nnumber of orders placed for out-of-stock items, allowing us to better manage aging inventory and minimize customer dissatisfaction by\neliminating backorder merchandise.\n43\n● Transaction management. We have developed and deployed a scalable back office platform that allows us to monitor transactions and\nchanges to financial data as well as provide our management with daily updates. We utilize both proprietary and third-party applications\nfor accepting and validating purchase orders, placing and tracking orders with suppliers, managing inventory and assigning it to purchase\norders, and ensuring proper shipment of products to customers.\n● Fulfillment management. We have software for our fulfillment operations that tracks customer orders from placement through packing and\nshipping. We have installed sophisticated, “pick-to-light” conveyor systems and associated software and are making investments in new\nwarehouse robotics technology. We have also developed software modules that efficiently manage the sorting and picking process of our\nproducts. Our systems are integrated with those from our primary U.S. shipping partners to facilitate tracking of the orders after shipment.\n● Anti-fraud monitoring. Online fraud is a constant threat to the security and reliability of e-commerce retailers. We work with third-party\nvendors to monitor our network security devices and secure our online payment systems. We have developed proprietary tools in-house to\nmonitor our online traffic for suspicious activities. Our websites have earned certifications from organizations and agencies like Tevora,\nbased on our meeting of their information protection and fraud prevention standards.\nResearch & Development Team\nOur global research and development team is focused on innovation through software development, algorithm design and development, and IT\ninfrastructure design and maintenance. Our research and development personnel continually upgrade our platforms and test new features to improve\nour customer experience. Our research and development team also develops custom-built proprietary systems and engages third-party solutions to\nsupport our specific customer, vendor and Marketplace seller requirements, including handling heavy traffic on our platforms, and providing quick\nand efficient fulfillment services to meet customer expectations.\nSecurity and Privacy Policy\nWe are committed to protecting information security across all Newegg platforms. We use a variety of techniques to protect the integrity of our\nnetworks and the confidential data we collect and store. Confidential information concerning our customers, sellers and suppliers is encrypted and\nprotected using SSL encryption software. In addition, we use multiple layers of network segregation and hierarchical levels of firewall technology\nto protect against attacks or unauthorized access to our networks, servers, and databases. We also continue to build new procedural safeguards as\npart of our comprehensive privacy program. We operate in a secured and locked facility that requires all of our employees to check in and wear\nvalid ID badges.\nWe have adopted a detailed privacy policy that describes in plain language our data use practices and how privacy is protected at Newegg, including\nthe extent to which other Newegg users may have access to this information. We require users to acknowledge and expressly agree to this policy\nwhen registering with our platforms. For more information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Newegg’s Business — A significant inadvertent\ndisclosure or breach of confidential or personal information we hold could be detrimental to our business, reputation and results of operations.”\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees\nand suppliers for the purpose of protecting the proprietary rights associated with the products branded under our private labels. We control access to\nuse and distribution of our intellectual property through license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties\nand our employment and contractor agreements.\n44\nOur intellectual property portfolio includes numerous domain names for websites that we use in our business. We have registered the domain names\nNewegg.com, Newegg.ca and NeweggBusiness.com and their variations. Our “Newegg” trademark and logo have also been registered with the\nrelevant authorities in the United States, Canada and China (as well as in other regions, such as the European Union and Brazil). Furthermore, we\nhave also registered the trademarks and logos of our private labels, such as Rosewill and ABS.\nIn addition to the protection of our intellectual property, we are focusing on ensuring that our product offerings (especially our private-label\nproducts) do not infringe on the intellectual property of others. Generally, our agreements with suppliers contain provisions to safeguard us against\npotential intellectual property infringement by our suppliers and impose penalties in the event of any infringement. We reserve the right to refuse to\nwork with or terminate our relationship with suppliers where we become aware that they are violating the intellectual property rights of a third\nparty.\nCompetition\nThe worldwide market in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many\ndifferent industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (i) online, offline and multichannel retailers, publishers,\nvendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to customers; (ii) companies that provide ancillary D2C\nplatform services and solutions, including website development, advertising, customer service and payment processing; (iii) companies that provide\nfulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; and (iv) companies that design, manufacture, market,\nor sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our market are:\n● breadth and quality of product offerings;\n● pricing;\n● fulfillment capabilities;\n● brand recognition and reputation;\n● customer service;\n● ability to respond more quickly to changing consumer preferences;\n● ability to reach a geographically broader set of customers; and\n● ability to be more flexible in marketing to a specific set of potential customers.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater\ncontrol over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive\ndistribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with\nrestrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid\nchange and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into\nbusiness combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\nOur principal market is in the United States, where we compete with retail stores and resellers, including superstores such as Best Buy, Costco and\nWalmart, hardware and software vendors that sell directly to end users, online retailers such as Amazon, and other marketers and resellers of IT/CE\nproducts.\nSee also Item 3 under the heading “Risk Factors,” the subheading “Our business faces intense domestic and international competition.”\nSeasonality\nOur business performance is subject to seasonal fluctuations. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo an increase in activity during\nthe year-end holiday period. These seasonal effects cause differences in revenues and expenses among the various quarters of any financial year,\nwhich means that the individual quarters should not be directly compared with one another or be used to predict annual financial results. This intra-\nyear seasonal fluctuation in demand is in accord with historic experience in the retail and e-commerce industries, with increased volumes during the\nfourth calendar quarter of the year.\n45\nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer personal information and\nregulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. Other existing and future laws cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the\ntracking of consumer activities, marketing emails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing,\ncontent and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.\nParticularly, under applicable federal and state laws and regulations addressing privacy and data security, we must provide notice to consumers of\nour policies with respect to the collection and use of personal information, and our sharing of personal information with third parties and notice of\nchanges to our data handling practices. In some instances, we may be obligated to give customers the right to prevent sharing of their personal\ninformation with third parties. Under applicable federal and state laws, we also are required to comply with a number of requirements when sending\ncommercial email to consumers, including identifying advertising and promotional emails as such, ensuring that subject lines are not deceptive,\ngiving consumers an opportunity to opt out of further communications and clearly disclosing our name and physical address in each commercial\nemail. Regulation of privacy and data security matters is an evolving area, with new laws and regulations enacted frequently. For example,\nCalifornia enacted legislation that, among other things, requires new disclosures to California consumers, and affords such consumers new abilities\nto opt out of certain sales of personal information, which was effective on January 1, 2020. In addition, under applicable federal and state unfair\ncompetition laws, including the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and U.S. Federal Trade Commission, regulations, we must accurately\nidentify product offerings, not make misleading claims on our platforms, and use qualifying disclosures where and when appropriate.\nThere is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, auctions,\nlibel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and commercial online services. For example, tax authorities in a number of states are currently\nreviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state\nsales and income taxes. Additionally, new state legislation may also subject us to other types of taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application\nof laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to\nthe Internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business or may necessitate\nchanges to our business practices. These obligations or changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur international operations are subject to foreign laws and regulations addressing topics such as customs duties and taxes, advertising and\nmarketing practices, privacy, data protection and information security and consumer rights, as well as additional laws and regulations, including\nrestrictions on imports from, exports to, and services provided to persons located in certain countries and territories, any of which might apply by\nvirtue of our operations in foreign countries and territories or our contacts with consumers in such foreign countries and territories. For example, in\nCanada, we are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy and data security laws, safety regulations and other\nlaws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to online retailers and/or the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of\nstores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws, regulations, treaties, and agreements, and believe that we are in material\ncompliance with applicable laws.\nC. Organizational Structure\nSee Exhibit 8.1 for a list of our significant subsidiaries.\n46\nD.

In June 2023, we purchased a tenant-occupied office building in Diamond\nBar, California, which we intend to utilize as our new headquarters beginning in the second half of 2024. We also lease additional corporate office\nfacilities and fulfillment and warehouse operations throughout North America, principally in California, Indiana, and Georgia in the United States,\nand Toronto in Canada. Outside of North America, we also own or lease corporate office facilities principally in China and Taiwan. We own\nwarehouse facilities in Shanghai, China that are currently leased to third party tenants. Our Asia headquarters is in Shanghai. We also periodically\nevaluate our facility requirements as necessary and believe our existing and planned facilities will be sufficient for our needs for at least the next 12\nmonths.\nItem 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are\nsubject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or\nimplied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and\n“Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and elsewhere in this annual report. We have prepared our financial statements in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\nOverview\nNewegg is a leading technology-focused e-commerce company in North America, and ranked as the number one online marketplace in the\nelectronics product category according to Web Retailer, based on an estimated 16.9 million website visits for the month of April 2023. Through\nNewegg.com, our flagship retail site, and other online platforms, we connect our global customer base to a wide and increasing assortment of tech\nproducts and a massive pool of brands, sellers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and third-party service providers.\nHeadquartered in California, Newegg’s reach is global. Leveraging our extensive fulfillment and warehousing network and the global footprint of\nour suppliers and sellers, we are able to offer merchandise sourced from over 40 countries and regions to customers located in over 20 countries and\nregions and deliver customer services in multiple languages.\n47\nNewegg’s Business Model\nGMV is the primary driver of our net sales, as we derive a significant majority of net sales from the GMV transacted on our online platforms, net of\ncancellations and returns. We define GMV as the total dollar value of products sold on our websites and third-party marketplace platforms, directly\nto customers and by our Marketplace sellers through Newegg Marketplace, net of returns, discounts, taxes, and cancellations. GMV also includes\nthe services fees charged through our NPS in rendering services for our 3PL, SBN, SLS, staffing and media ad services, as well as the sales made\nby our Asia subsidiaries. We generate GMV and net sales primarily from the following sources:\n● Direct sales, where we control inventories sourced from suppliers and directly sell goods to our customers on our platforms or certain other\nthird-party platforms. Our direct sales revenues include net sales generated from sales of products directly by us to customers on our\nNewegg platforms (including wholesale where we sell inventories in bulk and mostly at a discount), sales through third-party websites of\nproducts we source from suppliers, and freight revenues from fees we charge for delivery of goods that we directly sell to customers.\n● Newegg Marketplace, where third-party sellers sell products through our Newegg Marketplace, and we recognize commission and service\nfees from such third-party sellers in our net sales. The published commission rates are based on a percentage of the GMV transacted,\nexclusive of the shipping fees charged, which commission rates range from 8% to 15%, depending on the product category. We refer to the\nnet sales generated from Newegg Marketplace as Marketplace revenues.\n● Newegg Partner Services (“NPS”), where we generate net sales primarily by charging service fees for a range of e-commerce services and\nsolutions rendered to our vendor partners, Marketplace sellers and various types of customers and businesses, including 3PL and other\nfulfillment and logistics services, advertising services, and online marketing services. We refer to such net sales as services revenues.\nFactors Affecting Newegg’s Results of Operations\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of important factors, including the\nfollowing:\nNewegg’s ability to grow our customer base and increase their engagement level\nWe monitor the following key operating metrics to evaluate our user traffic and the engagement of our customer base.\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\nKey Operating Metrics: 2023 2022 2021\nNumber of active customers(1) 2.5 million 2.7 million 3.5 million\nRepeat purchase rate(2) 29.2% 31.3% 31.9%\nAverage order value(3) $ 379 $ 411 $ 442\nNote:\n1. Active customers as of a given date are calculated by unique customer ID with at least one transaction purchased on our platforms during the\nrelevant 12-month measurement period.\n2. Measured by the percentage of customers who made at least two purchases on Newegg platforms during the relevant 12-month measurement\nperiod.\n3. Calculated by dividing sales volume by number of transactions during the relevant 12-month measurement period.\nWe use the above operating metrics to measure our overall customer engagement with our platforms. Our operating metrics vary from time to time\ndue to factors including economic trends, new product releases, the level of competition we face, and the purchase patterns of our customers. The\nnumber of active customers, repeat purchase rates, and average order value are indicators of the size and engagement of our customer base.\n48\nNewegg’s product mix\nWe offer a wide range of technology products from a broad mix of brands and sellers. As of December 31, 2023, we offered approximately\n6.2 million SKUs across over 1,595 categories. Products are offered on our online platforms across a range of types, brands, and price points. We\nbelieve that customers are attracted to our online platforms primarily by the breadth and depth of our product offerings, a critical component of our\nability to increase sales and drive long-term profitability.\nOur results of operations are affected by our merchandise mix, as products of different categories, brands and price points have a range of margin\nand profitability profiles. For example, categories where we hold lower market share and we strive to grow at an accelerated rate over market may\noffer relatively lower margins. Our merchandise mix may shift over time due to the combination of a variety of factors, including consumer\ndemands and preferences, average selling prices, our ability to maintain and expand our supplier relationships, our ability to forecast market trends,\nand our marketing and promotional efforts. We continuously monitor the GMV and margin mix of our product offerings and we seek to increase the\npercentage of GMV and net sales from categories and brands with attractive margin profiles.\nSuccess of Newegg Marketplace\nA key component of our long-term strategy is the success of our Newegg Marketplace, which we believe is an important driver of future profitable\ngrowth.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, our Newegg Marketplace generated GMV of $369.7 million, $552.2 million, and\n$742.4 million, respectively, and accounted for approximately 20.4%, 25.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of our total GMV. During the same periods,\nour Newegg Marketplace generated net sales of $32.3 million, $47.0 million, and $63.5 million, respectively, and accounted for 2.2%, 2.7%, and\n2.7%, respectively, of our total net sales. The decrease in GMV and net sales in our Marketplace business for the year ended December 31, 2023\nversus prior years is primarily due to a decrease in consumer demand, but also partially attributable to a significant year-over-year reduction in the\nnumber of Marketplace sellers and SKUs due to quality control and fraud prevention initiatives, as well as category consolidation initiatives\ndesigned to streamline our Marketplace catalogue.\nOur results of operations have been, and will continue to be, influenced by shifts over time in the GMV mix between direct sales and Marketplace.\nThis is primarily due to the difference in revenue recognition — we recognize revenues from direct sales on a gross basis, while we recognize\nrevenues from the Newegg Marketplace on a net basis. See “— Key Components of Results of Operations” for details. Accordingly, for the same\namount of GMV, direct sales generates more net sales than Marketplace and, therefore, an increase in the GMV contribution of Marketplace as a\nportion of the total GMV would have a negative impact on our net sales.\nNewegg’s ability to forecast consumer needs and preferences\nThe IT/CE e-commerce market in North America and globally is characterized by rapidly evolving technologies, fast-changing consumer\nrequirements and preferences and frequent releases of new products and introductions of updated industry standards and practices. We must\neffectively respond to these changes to remain competitive. We may have difficulty anticipating consumer demand and preferences, and the goods\noffered on our online platforms may not be accepted by the market or may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical. Our inability to adapt to these\ndevelopments may lead to excessive or deficient inventories or a failure to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nNewegg’s ability to source products from key suppliers on favorable terms\nAs of December 31, 2023, we offered over 103,000 direct sales SKUs sourced from at least 325 suppliers globally. We maintain extensive, long-\nstanding and mutually beneficial relationships with many of the biggest tech product brands and distributors globally. However, our contracts or\narrangements with such suppliers generally do not guarantee the availability of merchandise or provide for the continuation of particular pricing or\nother practices. Our suppliers may not continue to sell their inventory to us on current terms or at all, and, if the terms are changed, we may not be\nable to establish new supply relationships on similar or better terms.\n49\nWe compete with other retailers and direct marketers for favorable product allocations and vendor incentive programs from product manufacturers\nand distributors. Some of our competitors could enter into exclusive or favorable distribution arrangements for certain products with our vendors,\nwhich would deny us complete or partial access to those products and marketing and promotional resources. In addition, some vendors whose\nproducts are offered on our online platforms also sell their products directly to customers. If we are unable to develop and maintain relationships\nwith suppliers that permit us to obtain sufficient quantities of desirable merchandise on favorable terms, our results of operations could be adversely\nimpacted.\nSegment Information\nOur chief operating decision maker (i.e. chief executive officer) reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by\ndisaggregated information about revenue by countries or regions for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. There\nare no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results and plans for levels or components below the consolidated unit\nlevel. Based on qualitative and quantitative criteria established by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segment Reporting,” we\nconsider ourselves to be operating within one reportable segment.\nA. Operating Results\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nOur net sales consist of direct sales revenues, Marketplace revenues and services revenues. See “— Newegg’s Business Model” for more\ninformation about these sources of net sales.\nOur net sales are reported net of anticipated discounts, returns, allowances, sales tax and credit card chargebacks, which are all estimated from\nhistorical experience. We also offer customer promotional programs, which we record as reductions in sales based on anticipated redemption rates\nestimated from historical experience.\nThe following table sets forth the components of our net sales in absolute amounts and as percentages of total net sales, for the periods indicated.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions, except for percentages)\nNet sales Amount % Amount % Amount %\nDirect sales revenues $ 1,396.6 93.3 $ 1,607.0 93.4 $ 2,243.4 94.4\nMarketplace revenues 32.3 2.2 47.0 2.7 63.5 2.7\nServices revenues 68.1 4.5 66.3 3.9 69.3 2.9\nTotal $ 1,497.0 100.0 $ 1,720.3 100.0 $ 2,376.2 100.0\nCost of Sales\nThe largest component of our cost of sales is the purchase price of goods that we directly sell to customers. Cost of sales also includes (i) costs\nrelating to our service revenues, which include personnel expenses and other costs relating to our third-party logistics services; (ii) inbound and\noutbound freight costs; and (iii) inventory write-offs relating to refurbished, slow-moving and obsolete inventories and adjustments for vendor\nincentives related to inventory still on hand at the reporting date.\nCost of sales is partially offset by payments we earn under vendor incentive programs, or VIPs, such as purchase rebates, marketing development\nfunds that vendors give us to advertise their products, cooperative marketing programs jointly funded with vendors, and price protection refunds to\noffset reductions in the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. These VIPs are sometimes tied to the volume of our purchases or sales and represent\nan indirect or effective reduction of the selling price of the suppliers’ products. Therefore, we treat these program payments as reductions to cost of\nsales.\n50\nThe following table sets forth the components of our cost of sales, in absolute amounts and as percentages of total net sales, for the periods\nindicated.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions, except for percentages)\nCost of sales Amount % Amount % Amount %\nPurchase price of goods sold by us directly $ 1,227.5 92.3 $ 1,405.0 93.4 $ 1,916.3 93.5\nCosts related to Marketplace & service revenues 50.9 3.8 49.4 3.3 59.6 2.9\nInbound and outbound freight costs 48.1 3.6 49.2 3.3 64.5 3.1\nInventory write-downs 5.0 0.4 6.0 0.4 8.2 0.4\nAddition to (release of) inventory reserves (2.1) (0.1) (6.0) (0.4) 1.6 0.1\nTotal $ 1,329.4 100.0 $ 1,503.6 100.0 $ 2,050.2 100.0\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe largest component of our selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A expenses”), is salary and other compensation costs, consisting\nof expenses relating to the employment of our employees, as well as temporary personnel to meet our needs in areas such as customer service and\nfulfillment during seasonal peaks in orders.\nOther significant components of SG&A expenses include advertising and marketing expenses, merchant processing fees, depreciation and\namortization, rent expenses, warehouse costs, office expenses, professional fees, and other general corporate costs.\nThe following table sets forth the components of our SG&A expenses, in absolute amounts and as percentages of net sales, for the periods indicated.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions, except for percentages)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses Amount % Amount Amount %\nSalary and other compensation costs $ 121.8 51.0 $ 134.5 50.5 $ 126.6 43.3\nMerchant processing fees 35.3 14.8 42.7 16.0 59.3 20.3\nAdvertising and marketing 12.7 5.3 14.7 5.5 32.8 11.2\nDepreciation and amortization 13.4 5.6 11.0 4.1 11.1 3.8\nOthers 55.4 23.3 63.3 23.9 62.7 21.4\nTotal $ 238.6 100.0 $ 266.2 100.0 $ 292.5 100.0\n51\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations in absolute amounts and as percentages of our net sales for the periods\nindicated.

In addition, consumer purchases of technology products during the\npandemic, along with longer expected product lifespans, have extended the upgrade cycle. As a result, the customer demand for technology\nproducts has decreased compared to the prior year period.\n52\nCost of sales & gross profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our cost of sales decreased by 11.6% compared to the comparable prior year period from $1,503.6 million\nin 2022 to $1,329.4 million in 2023, generally reflective of the decrease in our net sales. During the same period, our gross profit decreased by\n22.7% from $216.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $167.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur profit margin decreased to 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 12.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to\nthe significant decline in consumer demand caused by reduction in consumer discretionary spending for certain products such as video graphic\ncards, desktops and notebooks. We implemented aggressive promotions in 2023 in order to stay competitive which caused the decline in margin.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, SG&A expenses decreased to $238.6 million from $266.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nwhich mainly resulted from (i) a decrease in salary and other compensation costs by $12.7 million, (ii) a decrease in merchant payment fee by $7.4\nmillion which is variable to sales, and (iii) a decrease in marketing expense by $2.0 million.\nInterest income and expense\nInterest income is earned on (i) our loans to affiliates; and (ii) cash invested in money market accounts or certificates of deposit. See “Related Party\nTransactions” for more information about our loans to affiliates. Interest expense represents the interest we are charged on our borrowings,\nincluding term loan, line of credit and capital leases.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, interest income increased to $2.3 million from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, interest expense increased to $2.5 million from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOther income, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded other income, net of $2.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, other income, net, primarily consisted of sales tax rebate from Texas of $0.9 million, property rental income of $1.1 million,\nsales tax discount income of $0.3 million, and foreign exchange gain of $0.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, other income, net,\nprimarily consisted of sales tax rebate from Texas of $1.2 million, property rental income of $1.4 million, sales tax discount income of $0.4 million,\nforeign exchange gain of $0.9 million and other miscellaneous income of $1.3 million.\nImpairment of equity method investment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we impaired our equity method investment of $2.3 million on our investment in Mountain Capital Fund L.P.\n(“Mountain Capital”). Mountain Capital was fully dissolved in 2023. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nGain from sale of investment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 60% of our investment in Bitmain Technologies Holding Company for $14.1 million and all of our\ninvestment in Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company for $1.7 million. The Company recorded a total gain on sale of investment of $6.8 million.\nSee Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 25% of our investment in Bitmain Technologies Holding Company for $5.4 million and recorded a\ngain on sale of investment of $1.7 million.\n53\nChange in fair value of warrants liabilities\nWarrants are remeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in each reporting period. For the year ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, we recorded gain on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $0.01 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\nProvision for/(benefit from) income taxes\nOur benefit from income taxes was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to a provision of $14.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease in our provision for income taxes was mainly due to the recording of the tax audit settlement of $2.7 million and\nthe Canada net operating loss carryback of $2.8 million in year 2023, as well as the valuation allowance of $17.5 million in year 2022.\nNet income/(loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a net loss of $59.0 million, as compared to $57.4 million for the same period in 2022. The\ndecrease in net income is primarily driven by a decline in our net sales and gross margin.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nNet sales\nNet sales decreased by 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the comparable prior year period from $2,376.2 million in 2021\nto $1,720.3 million in 2022, which was mainly due to the decrease in GMV from our direct sales and marketplace businesses from $2,195.9 million\nand $742.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively, to $1,544.8 million and $552.2 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022, respectively.\nThe decrease in GMV was primarily due to a downward trend in consumer spending in technology products in light of economic uncertainty and\nrecession fears as consumers reduced their discretionary spending. In addition, recent consumer purchases of technology products during the\npandemic, along with longer expected product lifespans, have extended the upgrade cycle. As a result, the customer demand for technology\nproducts has significantly decreased compared to the prior year period.\nCost of sales & gross profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, our cost of sales decreased by 26.7% compared to the comparable prior year period from $2,050.2 million\nin 2021 to $1,503.6 million in 2022, generally reflective of the decrease in our net sales. During the same period, our gross profit decreased by\n33.5% from $326.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $216.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur profit margin decreased to 12.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to\nthe significant decline in consumer demand caused by reduction in consumer discretionary spending for certain products such as video graphic\ncards, hard disk and solid-state drives which led to excess inventory in 2022. We implemented aggressive promotions in 2022 to move inventory\nwhich caused a significant drop in margin.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, SG&A expenses decreased to $266.2 million from $292.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021,\nwhich mainly resulted from (i) a decrease in merchant payment fee by $16.6 million which is variable to sales and (ii) a decrease in marketing\nexpense by $18.1 million, partially offset by an increase in salary and other compensation cost of $7.8 million mainly due to an increase in stock-\nbased compensation by $27.6 million and a decrease in personnel expense by $19.8 million.\n54\nInterest income and expense\nInterest income is earned on (i) our loans to affiliates; and (ii) cash invested in money market accounts or certificates of deposit. See “Related Party\nTransactions” for more information about our loans to affiliates. Interest expense represents the interest we are charged on our borrowings,\nincluding term loan, line of credit and capital leases.\nInterest income remained consistent at $1.2 million and $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInterest expense remained consistent at $0.7 million and $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOther income, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded other income, net of $5.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, other income, net, primarily consisted of sales tax rebate from Texas of $1.2 million, property rental income of $1.4 million,\nsales tax discount income of $0.4 million, foreign exchange gain of $0.9 million and other miscellaneous income of $1.3 million. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, other income, net, primarily consisted of sales tax rebate from Texas of $1.3 million, insurance proceeds of approximately\n$1.0 million related to the inventory loss in the U.S., property rental income of $1.6 million, sales tax discount income of $0.4 million, and other\nmiscellaneous income of $0.8 million, which was partially offset by foreign exchange loss of $3.3 million.\nImpairment of equity method investment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we impaired our equity method investment of $2.3 million on our investment in Mountain Capital. See Note\n6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nGain from sale of investment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 25% of our investment in Bitmain Technologies Holding Company for $5.4 million and recorded a\ngain on sale of investment of $1.7 million. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nChange in fair value of warrants liabilities\nWarrants are remeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in each reporting period. For the year ended December 31,\n2022 and 2021, we recorded gain on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $1.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nProvision for/(benefit from) income taxes\nOur provision for income taxes was $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a benefit of $5.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase in our provision for income taxes was mainly due to the recording of the valuation allowance of $17.5 million.\nNet income/(loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a net loss of $57.4 million in 2022, as compared to a net income of $36.3 million for the same\nperiod in 2021. The decrease in net income is primarily driven by a decline in our net sales and gross margin.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included GMV and Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, in this annual report. We believe that these are key measures used\nby our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions\nregarding the allocation of capital.\n55\nGMV\nGMV is the total dollar value of products sold on our websites and third-party marketplace platforms, directly to customers and by our Marketplace\nsellers through Newegg Marketplace, net of returns, discounts, taxes, and cancellations. GMV also includes the services fees charged through our\nNPS in rendering services such as 3PL, SBN, staffing and media ad services, as well as the sales made by our Asia subsidiaries. It helps us assess\nand analyze changes in revenues, and if reviewed in conjunction with net sales and other GAAP financial measures, it can provide more information\nin evaluating our current performance and in assessing our future performance. See “— Newegg’s Business Model.”\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nNet Sales $ 1,497.0 $ 1,720.3 $ 2,376.2\nAdjustments:\nGMV – Marketplace 369.7 552.2 742.4\nMarketplace Commission (33.6) (49.6) (67.0)\nDeferred Revenue (5.4) (9.3) (8.3)\nOther (15.2) (17.5) (14.9)\nGMV $ 1,812.5 $ 2,196.1 $ 3,028.4\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that includes the removal of various one-time, irregular, and non-recurring items from EBITDA. We\nbelieve that exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period\nbasis and excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted\nEBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our\nmanagement and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as\nreported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n● although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the\nfuture, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure\nrequirements;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n● Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a\ncomparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow\nmetrics, operating profit and our other GAAP results.\n56\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nNet income (loss) $ (59.0) $ (57.4) $ 36.3\nAdjustments:\nStock-based compensation expenses 33.7 33.9 6.3\nInterest expense (income), net 0.2 (0.5) (0.5)\nIncome tax (benefit) provision (2.7) 14.1 (5.8)\nDepreciation and amortization 13.4 11.0 10.8\nImpairment of equity method investment — 2.3 —\nLoss from equity method investment — — 7.4\nGain from sale of investment (6.8) (1.7) —\nGain from disposal of subsidiary — — (2.0)\nGain from change in fair value of warrants liabilities (0.1) (1.1) (0.1)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (21.3) $ 0.6 $ 52.4\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCash flows and working capital\nWe have historically funded our operations through existing working capital, credit facilities, bank loans, return from investing activities, and equity\nfinancings. See Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information about the line\nof credit and long-term debt that we obtain from financial institutions.\nOur cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts. Cash equivalents are all\nhighly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or fewer. Amounts receivable from payment processors are also considered cash\nequivalents as they are both short term and highly liquid in nature and are typically converted to cash within three business days. Amounts due to us\nfrom payment processors that are classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.9 million and $13.0 million at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. We anticipate that our existing cash and funds generated from operations, combined with periodic draws from our\nexisting line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and expected capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of\nthe filing of this annual report. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nWe historically experience higher sales in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. In anticipation of such higher sales, we typically begin\nbuilding up our inventory levels in the late third quarter. Such inventory build-up may require us to expend cash faster than we generate by our\noperations during these periods. Also, as a result of this inventory build-up and faster inventory turnover during the fourth quarter, our accounts\npayable are typically at their highest levels at year-end, as compared to the first, second and third quarters when sales are lower. From time to time,\nwe also invest in one-time capital expenditures such as the purchase of our new office building in Diamond Bar, California, for an aggregate\npurchase price of $23.2 million in June of 2023.\nWe intend to finance our future working capital requirements and capital expenditures from cash generated from operating activities, borrowings\nfrom our existing credit facilities, funds raised from financing activities, and returns from investing activities. Our future capital requirements may,\nhowever, vary materially from those now planned or anticipated. Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated net sales, increased\nexpenses or other events, including those described in “Risk Factors,” may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in the future. If our\nexisting cash is insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to issue debt or equity securities or obtain additional credit facilities. Financing\nmay not be available on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and our failure to raise adequate capital when needed could negatively impact\nour growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations. Issuance of additional equity securities, including convertible debt securities,\nwould dilute our earnings per share. The incurrence of debt would divert cash for working capital and capital expenditures to service debt\nobligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. If\nwe are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing as required, our business operations and prospects may suffer.\n57\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our selected consolidated cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nSummary Consolidated Cash Flow Data: (in millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (3.8) $ 20.5 $ (53.3)\nNet cash used in investing activities (14.3) (3.8) (13.8)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1.6 1.5 12.7\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (0.5) 1.0 1.0\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (17.0) 19.2 (53.4)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of the year 123.5 104.3 157.7\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of the year $ 106.5 $ 123.5 $ 104.3\nOperating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Our capital\nexpenditures were $30.3 million, $9.2 million, and $13.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The\nincrease in our capital expenditures in 2023 was primarily driven by the purchase of our new office building in Diamond Bar, California, for an\naggregate purchase price of $23.2 million.\nCredit Agreements\nWe entered into a credit agreement in August 2021 with several financing institutions that provided a revolving credit facility of up to $100 million\nwith a maturity date of August 20, 2024. Prior to August 20, 2023 and subject to certain terms and conditions, the Maximum Revolving Advance\nAmount, as defined in the credit agreement, could be increased up to $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit sublimit\nof $30.0 million, which can be used to issue standby and trade letters of credit, and a $20.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. In April 2023, we\namended the credit agreement in order to transition the benchmark rate for certain loans made under the credit agreement from LIBOR to SOFR. In\ngeneral, advances from this line of credit will be subject to interest at the Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, as defined in the credit\nagreement, so long as the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Term SOFR is offered, ascertainable, and not unlawful, or the Alternate Base Rate (to be\ndefined as the highest of the (a) the Base Rate in effect on such day, (b) the sum of the Overnight Bank Funding Rate in effect on such day plus\n0.50%, or (c) the daily Term SOFR Rate plus 1.0%) plus the Applicable Margin. For Term SOFR Rate loans, we may select interest periods of one\nor three months. Interest on Term SOFR Rate loans shall be payable at the end of the selected interest period. Interest on Alternate Base Rate loans\nis payable monthly. In the event of the permanent or indefinite cessation of the Term SOFR Rate, the Benchmark Replacement will replace the Term\nSOFR Rate. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. As of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, there was no balance outstanding under this line of credit.\nThe line of credit is secured by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and is collateralized by certain of our assets. Such assets include all receivables,\nequipment and fixtures, general intangibles, inventory, subsidiary stock, securities, investment property, and financial assets, contract rights, and\nledger sheets, as defined in the loan agreement. To maintain availability of funds under the loan agreement, we will pay on a quarterly basis, an\nunused commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on the unused amount for the facility. The credit facility contains customary covenants, including\ncovenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur capital expenditures and lease payments, make certain investments and enter into certain related-\nparty transactions. The credit facility also requires us to maintain certain minimum financial ratios and maintain operation banking relationship with\nthe financial institutions. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the line of credit.\n59\nC. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc.\nSee Item 4.B under the subheadings, “Technology” and “Intellectual Property.”\nD. Trend information\nOther than as disclosed in this annual report, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the current fiscal\nyear that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that caused the\ndisclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions.\nE. Critical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, costs and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities and other related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe\nto be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of our assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates, and we include any revisions to our estimates in our results for the period in which the actual amounts\nbecome known.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies described below affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating\nour historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations:\nIncentives Earned from Vendors\nWe participate in various vendor incentive programs that include, but are not limited to, purchasing-based volume discounts, sales-based volume\nincentives, marketing development funds, including for certain cooperative advertising, and price protection agreements. Vendor incentives may\ninclude estimates and are calculated based on the terms of vendor incentive agreements which may include non-standard contract terms. Vendor\nincentives are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as an offset to marketing and promotional expenses to the extent that they\nrepresent reimbursement of advertising costs incurred by us on behalf of the vendors that are specific, incremental, and identifiable.\nReimbursements that are in excess of such costs and all other vendor incentive programs are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, or if the\nrelated product inventory is still on hand at the reporting date, inventory is reduced in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. In accordance with ASC Topic 740,\nthe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred taxes are determined\nbased on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax rates expected to be in effect\nduring the years in which the bases differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is\nmore likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company considers a number of factors in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset associated with net operating losses and tax credit\ncarryforwards, including the reversal of temporary differences and future taxable income. The Company also considers the uncertainty posed by the\ncurrent economic environment and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that the Company takes into account in evaluating the need\nfor valuation allowance.\n60\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon\nexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the recognized tax benefit as the largest\namount of tax benefit that has greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The Company\nreverses a previously recognized tax benefit if it determines that the tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being\nsustained. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nExpense and Valuation of Shares of our Common Stock\nThe measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, consultants and directors,\nincluding employee stock options and restricted stock, is based on estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The value of awards that\nare ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nFor detailed discussion on stock-based compensation, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed discussion on recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Newegg Commerce, Inc.\nincluded elsewhere in this annual report.\nItem 6.

Compensation\n2023 Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the aggregate cash compensation accrued for directors, as a group, was approximately $1.0 million, of\nwhich less than $0.1 million is related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Employee directors did not receive any compensation for\ntheir services as directors. Non-employee directors were entitled to receive payment for serving as directors and may receive option grants or\nrestricted stock units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the aggregate cash compensation accrued for our executive officers, as a group, was approximately $5.4\nmillion, of which approximately $2.3 million was related to 2023 bonus payments that were paid out in July 2023 and February 2024. In addition,\nthe executive officers exercised stock options and restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2023 that resulted in aggregate proceeds of\n$1.7 million. We did not separately set aside any amounts for pensions, retirement, or other benefits for our executive officers, other than pursuant\nto relevant statutory requirements.\n64\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the aggregate cash compensation accrued for our CEO was approximately $2.6 million, of which $1.6\nmillion was for a 2023 bonus that was paid in July 2023 and February 2024. In addition, during the year, Mr. Chow exercised restricted stock units\nwith total proceeds of $1.1 million.\nDiscretionary Bonus and Profit Sharing Program\nNewegg’s CEO and other executive officers are eligible to participate in the Company’s annual Discretionary Bonus Program and Profit Sharing\nProgram. Under the Discretionary Bonus Program, executives are eligible to receive an annual cash bonus payment based upon corporate and\nindividual performance, as determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, with target bonus amounts ranging from 5% of base salary\nto 30% of base salary for plan year 2023. Under the annual Profit Sharing Program, the CEO and other executive officers are entitled to an annual\ncash bonus, as determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, based upon the Company’s GMV and adjusted EBITDA for the year,\nwith the bonus payout weighted 70% based on GMV performance and 30% based upon adjusted EBITDA performance for program year 2023.\nBonus awards under the Profit Sharing Program start at 30% of base salary (60% for the CEO) based upon meeting the threshold level of\nperformance and are subject to increase based upon performance above threshold. Payments under both the Discretionary Bonus Program and the\nProfit Sharing Program are contingent upon the executive remaining employed with the Company through the date bonuses are paid.\nStock Option Plans\nNewegg 2005 Incentive Award Plan\nIn September 2005, the Newegg 2005 Incentive Award Plan was approved and subsequently amended in January 2008, October 2009, December\n2011 and September 2015. Under the Newegg 2005 Incentive Award Plan, we may grant equity incentive awards to employees, directors, and\nconsultants based on our common shares. A committee of our board of directors determines the eligibility, types of equity awards, vesting\nschedules, and exercise prices for equity awards granted. Subject to certain adjustments in the event of a change in capitalization or similar\ntransaction, we may issue a maximum of 82,952,149 common shares under the Newegg 2005 Incentive Award Plan. We issue new common shares\nfrom this authorized share pool to settle stock-based compensation awards. The exercise price of options granted under the plan shall not be less\nthan the fair value of our common shares as of the date of grant. Options typically vest over a term of four years, and are typically exercisable for a\nperiod of 10 years after the date of grant, except when granted to a holder who, at the time the option is granted, owns stock representing more than\n10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Newegg or any subsidiaries, in which case, the term of the option shall be no more than five years\nfrom the date of grant. In September 2015, the Newegg 2005 Incentive Award Plan was amended to permit additional awards to be made after the\ntenth anniversary of the original adoption of said plan.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2021, the Newegg 2021 Equity Incentive Plan was approved, with 7,374,900 common shares reserved for issuance thereunder. In\nNovember 2021, all shares reserved under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan were granted to our executive officers and key employees in the form of\nrestricted stock unit awards. These grants vest over four years, with 25% vesting on the one-year anniversary of grant, and the remainder vesting\nmonthly over the following three years, such that they will be fully vested after four years. One half of the grants, or 3,687,450 RSUs, were granted\nto the Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Chow. Our other executive officers received a combined total of 680,000 RSUs. The remaining 3,007,450\nRSUs were granted or reserved for 252 other key employees or expected new hires.\nIn July 2022, the Board of Directors approved an amendment of the 2021 Plan to increase the maximum share pool from 7,374,900 to 16,374,900\nshares. In August 2022, 5,560,780 performance-based vesting restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) were granted to the Chief Executive Officer,\nAnthony Chow, vesting over four performance periods. The vesting of each PRSU is based on financial performance tied to Budgeted GMV as\ndefined in the grant agreement. The vesting of PRSUs is determined at the end of each of the four-year performance periods. The payout can vary\nfrom zero to 100% based on actual results and performance goals may be adjusted by the Compensation Committee from time to time in its sole\ndiscretion.\nIn addition, a combined total of 225,000 RSUs were granted to two executive officers who joined the Company in September and October of 2022.\n65\nAgreements with Executive Officers\nPursuant to our standard employment agreements with each of our executive officers (excluding our Chief Executive Officer), the employment with\neach of such executive officers is for a single three-year term, renewable thereafter in one-year increments. The employment is “at will” and can be\nterminated by us or each such executive officer at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, with or without cause. If the executive is\nterminated by us without cause or by the executive for good reason, then the executive is entitled to receive severance of 12 months’ base salary and\na prorated bonus. If such termination is also made in conjunction with a change of control, then the severance amount will increase to 24 months’\nbase salary and 200% of the executive’s target bonus. The agreements also contain customary confidentiality, non-solicit and invention assignment\nprovisions.\nOn November 19, 2021, we entered into an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Chow. The employment is “at will”\nand can be terminated by us or Mr. Chow at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, with or without cause. Under the terms of the\nagreement, Mr. Chow is guaranteed a base salary of $1.1 million per year and a target bonus of 160% to 200% of his base salary. The employment\nagreement has a four-year term, and guarantees that Mr. Chow will receive the base salary component for the entire term, even if he is terminated\nduring the term, unless he is terminated for cause. If Mr. Chow’s employment is terminated by us without cause or by Mr. Chow for good reason,\nthen he is entitled to receive severance of 12 months’ base salary and a bonus equal to the average of the prior three years’ annual bonuses at the\ntime of termination (this severance amount is in addition to the remaining owed guaranteed base salary for the rest of term). In addition, all\nunvested equity incentive awards that are outstanding and due to be vested within one year of his termination are subject to accelerated vesting if he\nis terminated by us without cause or by Mr. Chow for good reason. If termination without cause or for good reason occurs in the context of a change\nin control of Newegg, then the severance increases to 24 months’ base salary (instead of 12 months’) and all unvested equity incentive awards that\nare outstanding at the time of his termination (not just those that vest within one year) are subject to accelerated vesting. The agreement also\ncontains customary confidentiality, non-solicit and invention assignment provisions.\nC. Board Practices\nBoard of Directors\nOur Board currently consists of seven directors. None of our directors has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon termination of\nservice as a director.\nA director may vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he or she is interested, provided, however that the nature of the interest of any\ndirector in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him or her at or prior to the consideration and vote on that matter. A general notice\nor disclosure to the directors or otherwise contained in the minutes of a meeting or a written resolution of the directors or any committee thereof of\nthe nature of a director’s interest shall be sufficient disclosure and after such general notice it shall not be necessary to give special notice relating to\nany particular transaction. A director may be counted for a quorum upon a motion in respect of any contract or arrangement which he or she shall\nmake with our company, or in which he or she is so interested and may vote on such motion. There are no membership qualifications for directors.\nFurther, there are no share ownership qualifications for directors unless so fixed by us in a general meeting.\nThe Nasdaq Listing Rules generally require that a majority of an issuer’s board of directors must consist of independent directors. However, the\nNasdaq Listing Rules permit foreign private issuers like us to follow “home country practice” in certain corporate governance matters. We currently\nhave a majority of independent directors serving on our Board, but may rely on this “home country practice” exception in the future. Mr. Gregory\nMoore, Mr. Richard Weil, Mr. Poi (Paul) Wu, and Mr. Fuya (Frank) Zheng are our independent directors.\nWe do not have a lead independent director because we believe our independent directors are encouraged to freely voice their opinions on a\nrelatively small company board.\n66\nOur Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, subject to compliance with applicable laws and Nasdaq Listing Rules,\nprovides that Digital Grid and Mr. Fred Chang, acting as the “Minority Representative,” shall be entitled to designate nominees to our Board in a\nnumber that is proportionate to the voting power of Digital Grid and its affiliates, and our Legacy Shareholders, respectively.\nDigital Grid has nominated Mr. Zhitao He, Ms. Yingmei Yang, Mr. Poi (Paul) Wu, and Fuya (Frank) Zheng to serve as directors. Mr. Fred Chang\nhas nominated Mr. Fred Chang, Mr. Gregory Moore and Mr. Richard Weil to serve as directors.\nDuties of Directors\nUnder British Virgin Islands law, our directors have duties to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to our best interests. Our directors also have\na duty to exercise the care, diligence and skills that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. In fulfilling their duty\nof care to us, our directors must oversee the Company, including our compliance with our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation. We have the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached. The functions and powers of our board include, among\nothers:\n● appointing officers and determining the term of office of the officers;\n● authorizing the payment of donations to religious, charitable, public or other bodies, clubs, funds or associations as deemed advisable;\n● exercising the borrowing powers of the Company and mortgaging the property of the Company;\n● executing checks, promissory notes and other negotiable instruments on behalf of the Company; and\n● maintaining or registering a register of mortgages, charges or other encumbrances of the Company.\nLimitation of Director and Officer Liability\nBritish Virgin Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification\nof officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the British Virgin Islands courts to be contrary to public policy,\nsuch as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime.\nUnder our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, we may indemnify our directors, officers and liquidators against all\nexpenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection with civil,\ncriminal, administrative or investigative proceedings to which they are party or are threatened to be made a party by reason of their acting as our\ndirector, officer or liquidator. To be entitled to indemnification, these persons must have acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best\ninterest of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, they must have had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful.\nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers. These agreements require us to indemnify these\nindividuals, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for certain liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of their affiliation with us.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted for our directors or officers under the foregoing\nprovisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act\nand is therefore unenforceable as a matter of United States law.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nOn August 6, 2020, Hangzhou Lianluo and Mr. Zhitao He received an investigation notice from the China Securities Regulatory Commission\n(“CSRC”) for alleged violation of laws and regulations regarding information disclosures of Hangzhou Lianluo. Hangzhou Lianluo is a PRC\ncompany with shares listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and is a majority owner of Newegg through Digital Grid, a wholly-owned subsidiary.\nMr. He is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hangzhou Lianluo. Mr. He was the former Chairman and the former Chief Executive\nOfficer of Lianluo Smart Limited (the predecessor company of Newegg prior to the Merger) and is currently the chairman of our board.\n67\nOn October 19, 2020, Hangzhou Lianluo announced that it has received a notice of administrative punishment from the Zhejiang Regulatory\nBureau of CSRC, which provided, among other things, that (i) Hangzhou Lianluo received a warning and would be required to correct its unlawful\nacts and pay a fine of RMB 300,000, and (ii) Mr. Zhitao He received a warning and was required to pay a fine of RMB 400,000.\nFurther, the shares of our common stock owned by Digital Grid have been pledged to Bank of China Limited Zhejiang Branch, or BOC, as\ncollateral to support working capital loans and letters of credit provided by BOC to Hangzhou Lianluo. The loans have been guaranteed jointly and\nseverally by Beijing Digital Grid Technology Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Hangzhou Lianluo, and by Mr. Zhitao He. The total principal amount owed\nunder these loans as of March 31, 2023 was RMB150 million in RMB-denominated loans plus USD$66.5 million in U.S. dollar-denominated loans.\nIn May 2020, BOC filed several lawsuits against Hangzhou Lianluo, Digital Grid, Beijing Digital Grid Technology Co., Ltd. and Mr. Zhitao He in\nthe Hangzhou Intermediate People’s Court in China alleging that Hangzhou Lianluo has failed to repay the loans when due and is in breach of the\nloan agreements. The court has ruled that the loans are in default in a final, non-appealable judgment. On December 19, 2022, Digital Grid, BOC,\nNewegg, and Hangzhou Lianluo entered into a supplemental agreement (the “Supplemental Agreement”) to agree upon procedures to temporarily\nremove BOC’s lien on Digital Grid’s Newegg Common Shares to enable their sale and use of proceeds to repay BOC. Such sales of our common\nstock could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nIn addition, on April 11, 2023, Hangzhou Lianluo announced that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (“ICBC”) filed a lawsuit against\nHangzhou Lianluo in the Hangzhou Intermediate People’s Court in China alleging that Hangzhou Lianluo failed to repay when due three separate\nloans, provided by ICBC to Hangzhou Lianluo, and was in breach of the related loan agreements. The estimated total amount owed under the loans,\nincluding interest, fees, expenses and penalties, as of December 31, 2023 was approximately RMB485 million. Hangzhou Lianluo did not pledge\nany Common Shares owned by it or Digital Grid as collateral to support the ICBC loans. As disclosed by Hangzhou Lianluo on February 26, 2024,\nthe court has ruled in a court judgment that Hangzhou Lianluo owed ICBC RMB332 million (including interest) under one of such loans.\nAs of the date hereof, to the best of our knowledge, no Common Shares have been sold by Hangzhou Lianluo in connection with the repayment of\nthe BOC or ICBC loans.\nTo the best of our knowledge, except as disclosed herein, none of our directors or executive officers has been convicted in a criminal proceeding,\nexcluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors, or has been a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding during the past ten years that\nresulted in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining the person from future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state\nsecurities laws, or a finding of any violation of federal or state securities or commodities laws, any laws respecting financial institutions or\ninsurance companies, any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud in connection with any business entity or been subject to any disciplinary\nsanctions or orders imposed by a stock, commodities or derivatives exchange or other self-regulatory organization, except for matters that were\ndismissed without sanction or settlement.\nTerms of Directors and Executive Officers\nEach of our directors holds office until a successor has been duly elected and qualified unless the director was appointed by the Board, in which\ncase such director holds office until the next annual meeting of shareholders at which time such director is eligible for re-election. All of our\nexecutive officers are appointed by and serve at the discretion of our board.\nQualification\nThere is currently no shareholding qualification for directors, although a shareholding qualification for directors may be fixed by our shareholders\nby ordinary resolution.\n68\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nCurrently, three committees have been established under the Board: the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating\ncommittee. Each committee’s members and functions are described below.\nAudit Committee\nOur audit committee currently consists of Mr. Gregory Moore, Mr. Poi (Paul) Wu, and Mr. Fuya (Frank) Zheng. Mr. Moore is the chairman of our\naudit committee. We have determined that Mr. Moore, Mr. Wu, and Mr. Zheng satisfy the “independence” requirements of Section 5605(a)(2) of the\nNasdaq Listing Rules and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Our board also has determined that Mr. Moore qualifies as an audit committee\nfinancial expert within the meaning of the SEC rules or possesses financial sophistication within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The\naudit committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the financial statements of our company. The audit\ncommittee is responsible for, among other things:\n● appointing the independent auditors and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the\nindependent auditors;\n● reviewing with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and management’s response;\n● discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors;\n● reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our accounting and internal control policies and procedures and any steps taken to monitor\nand control major financial risk exposures;\n● reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions;\n● meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent auditors; and\n● monitoring compliance with our code of business conduct and ethics, including reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our\nprocedures for proper compliance.\nCompensation Committee\nOur compensation committee currently consists of Mr. Gregory Moore, Mr. Poi (Paul) Wu, and Mr. Fuya (Frank) Zheng. Mr. Wu is the chairman of\nour compensation committee. The compensation committee assists the board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all\nforms of compensation relating to our directors and executive officers. Our chief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting\nduring which his compensation is deliberated. The compensation committee is responsible for, among other things:\n● reviewing and recommending to the board the total compensation package for our most senior executive officers;\n● approving and overseeing the total compensation package for our executives other than the most senior executive officers;\n● reviewing and recommending to the board the compensation of our directors;\n● reviewing periodically and approving any long-term incentive compensation or equity plans;\n● selecting compensation consultants, legal counsel or other advisors after taking into consideration all factors relevant to that person’s\nindependence from management; and\n● reviewing all other compensation and benefit plans as appropriate.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee currently consists of Mr. Gregory Moore, Mr. Poi (Paul) Wu, and Mr. Fuya (Frank) Zheng.\nMr. Zheng is the chairperson of our nominating and corporate governance committee. The nominating and corporate governance committee assists\nthe Board in selecting individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the board and its committees. The\nnominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things:\n● identifying and recommending nominees for election or re-election to our Board or for appointment to fill any vacancy;\n69\n● reviewing annually with our Board its current composition in light of the characteristics of independence, age, skills, experience and\navailability of service to us;\n● identifying and recommending to our Board which directors to serve as members and chairpersons of committees of the Board;\n● reviewing our corporate governance principles and advising the Board periodically of any significant developments as appropriate; and\n● reviewing related person transactions as well as the policies and procedures for the review, approval and ratification of related person\ntransactions.\nD. Employees\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we employed a total of 932 and 1,355 full-time employees, respectively. The reduction in our employee count\nwas primarily due to workforce optimization measures made in response to changing macroeconomic conditions and shifting consumer demand for\nour products. The following tables give breakdowns of our full-time employees as of December 31, 2023 by function and by region.\nDepartment Count\nCustomer Service 54\nFinance 58\nFraud Prevention 22\nHR 17\nInternal Audit 4\nIT 347\nLegal 6\nLogistics 232\nOperations 27\nSales & Marketing 165\nTotal 932\nLocation Count\nChina 296\nTaiwan 46\nU.S. 574\nCanada 16\nTotal 932\nDuring the holiday season, we have historically added temporary workers to augment our full-time work force.

(“Newegg.com Americas”), in Superior Court in Los\nAngeles County, California, alleging that Newegg.com Americas had engaged in deceptive advertising practices and seeking to certify a class\naction. In 2016, the trial court sustained Newegg.com Americas’ demurrer to the plaintiff’s claims without leave to amend. The plaintiff appealed,\nand in July 2018 an appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court, thus allowing the case to proceed. On September 18, 2023, the trial court\ngranted our motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.\nIn September 2021, two subsidiaries of the Company were served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County, California,\nalleging various wage and hour violations and seeking to certify a class action. In October 2021, a second complaint was filed as a representative\naction pursuant to the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 against the same two subsidiaries in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County,\nCalifornia, alleging various violations of the California Labor Code. The Company intends to vigorously defend its subsidiaries in both matters. The\noutcome of these matters is uncertain. Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable result in either matter could materially affect our\nbusiness, consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, investigations and claims incidental to the conduct of our business. Except as disclosed\nabove, we are not currently a party to any legal proceeding or investigation which, in the opinion of our management, is likely to have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n72\nDividend Policy\nTo date, we have not paid any cash dividends on our shares. As a BVI company, we may only declare and pay dividends if our directors are\nsatisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the distribution (i) the value of our assets will exceed our liabilities and (ii) we will be able\nto pay our debts as they fall due. We currently anticipate that we will retain any available funds to finance the growth and operation of our business\nand we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our cash held in foreign countries may be subject to\ncertain control limitations or repatriation requirements, limiting our ability to use this cash to pay dividends.\nB.

Any director or member of a committee of the Board or the board of a subsidiary that is appointed or nominated by the Minority\nRepresentative shall be removed from their position upon and only upon, the written request of the Minority Representative; and\nii. Any director or member of a committee of the Board or the board of a subsidiary that is appointed or nominated by Digital Grid shall be\nremoved from their position upon and only upon, the written request of Liaison.\nRequirements of Board Approval on Certain Matters\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association also provides that, as long as the number of common shares held\nby Legacy Shareholders represents more than ten percent (10%) of the total voting power of all outstanding common shares of the Company, the\nCompany agrees not to take, or permit our subsidiaries to take, certain actions, without the approval of the affirmative vote of not less than a\nmajority of the number of votes represented by the directors, which majority must include one of the directors designated by the Minority\nRepresentative as being the Primary Minority Board Appointee. Such actions include the following:\ni. initiate any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy filing or similar action, recapitalization, share combination or division, restructuring or\nreorganization of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;\nii. other than to the Company or a wholly-owned subsidiary thereof, sell, license, transfer or otherwise dispose of (including through merger\nor consolidation) all or substantially all of the assets or properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in any transaction or series of\nrelated transactions;\n75\niii. agree to any merger, consolidation or combination of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or to a sale of all or substantially all of the\nassets of the Company in connection with a Company Sale (as defined in the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation);\niv. commence or undertake any Reorganization (as defined in the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association);\nv. issue, directly or indirectly, any equity interest of the Company or permit any of the subsidiaries to issue any equity interest other than, in\neach case, any Excluded Issuance (as defined in the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association);\nvi. materially alter or fundamentally change the nature of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries;\nvii. amend, change, or waive any provision of, the memorandum and articles of association of the Company;\nviii.purchase or otherwise acquire all or any part of the assets or business of, or Equity Interests or other evidences of beneficial ownership of,\ninvest in or participate in any joint venture, partnership or similar arrangement with, any Person (other than the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries), in each case in any transaction or series of related transactions involving a commitment in excess of $10,000,000;\nix. other than to the Company or a wholly-owned subsidiary thereof, sell, license, transfer or otherwise dispose of (including through merger\nor consolidation) any assets or properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case in any transaction or series of related\ntransactions involving a commitment in excess of $10,000,000;\nx. other than loans to wholly-owned subsidiaries, (A) extend any credit or make any loans to any Person, (B) incur, assume, guarantee,\nendorse or otherwise become responsible for indebtedness, or (C) amend, modify or supplement in any material respect the agreements\ngoverning (or otherwise extend or refinance) existing indebtedness;\nxi. appoint or remove the Chief Executive Officer of the Company;\nxii. enter into any Affiliate Transactions (as defined in the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association);\nxiii.amend, change or waive any of the actions of the Company described in the Fifth Amended and Restated Articles of Association or the\nrequired voting threshold specified herein;

and (iii) equity interests issued pursuant to acquisitions or strategic transactions approved by a majority of the disinterested\ndirectors of the Company provided that any such issuance shall only be to an entity (or to the equity holders of an entity) which is, itself or through\nits subsidiaries, an operating company or an owner of an asset in a business synergistic with the business of the Company and shall provide to the\nCompany additional benefits in addition to the investment of funds, but shall not include a transaction in which the Company is issuing equity\ninterests primarily for the purpose of raising capital or to an entity whose primary business is investing in securities.\nThe Company is required to give Principal Shareholders a notice stating the price (or formula by which the price will be determined, which may\nrefer to a future contingent event) and terms of issuance of new securities and to remain the offer to issue the Principal Shareholders their Pro Rata\nShares of such new securities (as defined below) open until the 15th calendar day following the receipt of such notice. The Principal Shareholders\nshall deliver an exercise notice along with payment to exercise their pre-emptive rights.\nIn the event that the Principal Shareholder fails to give an exercise notice timely, or elects to purchase fewer than all of its Pro Rata Share of such\nnew securities, then the Company shall send written notice to any Principal Shareholder who has elected to purchase all of its Pro Rata Share of\nsuch new securities, who will then have the right, by giving written notice to the Company within two business days upon receiving notice from the\nCompany, to purchase its Pro Rata Share of such unsubscribed portion, and such right shall continue to apply repeatedly and iteratively until all of\nsuch new securities have been allocated to the Principal Shareholders or none of the Principal Shareholders have elected to participate in such\nfurther purchase. If, at the end of such process, there are new securities that have not been subscribed for by the Principal Shareholders, the\nCompany may, for a period of time not to exceed 60 days, sell such unsubscribed new securities, on the same times to a third-party purchaser. If,\nhowever, at the end of such 60-day period, the Company has not consummated a sale of any of such unsubscribed new securities, the Company\nshall no longer be permitted to sell such new securities without again complying with these provisions of pre-emptive rights in the Amended\nShareholders Agreement.\nRight of First Refusal of the Company and Principal Shareholders\nPursuant to the Amended Shareholders Agreement, subject to compliance with applicable laws and Nasdaq’s Listing Rules, if any Principal\nShareholders or any of their affiliates, receives a bona fide offer from any person other than its affiliate for any of the common shares such Principal\nShareholders received in connection with the Merger (the “ROFR Shares”), then the Company has a right of first refusal, but not the obligation, to\nelect to purchase all (and not less than all) of the ROFR Shares, at the same price, and on the same terms and conditions offered by the purchaser\n(the “ROFR Terms”). In the event the Company does not decide to purchase such ROFR Shares or decides to purchase for less than all of the ROFR\nShares, then each of the Principal Shareholders other than the selling Principal Shareholders shall have a right of first refusal to elect to purchase all\n(and not less than all) of its Pro Rata Share of the ROFR Shares on the ROFR Terms. By amendment dated August 2022, the Amended and Restated\nShareholders Agreement was amended such that the Company’s right of first refusal would apply only to 80% of the shares of the Company’s\ncommon shares subject to such ROFR Right collectively owned by each Principal Shareholder and its Affiliates. For the purpose of this Amended\nShareholders Agreement, “Pro Rata Share” means the percentage which corresponds to the ratio which each selling Principal Shareholder’s\n“Percentage Interest” (which is calculated by dividing (i) the number of the common shares owned by such Principal Shareholder, by (ii) total\nnumber of the then outstanding shares of the common shares held by all Principal Shareholders) bears to the total Percentage Interests of all\nPrincipal Shareholders exercising their right of first refusal. In the event that the ROFR Shares are in exchange for non-cash consideration, then\nsuch right of first refusal shall be exercisable based on the fair market value determined in good faith by the board of such non-cash consideration.\nSuch rights of first refusal may delay or prevent us from raising other funding in the future and may have an adverse impact on the liquidity and\nmarket price of our common shares.\n77\nLimitations on Right to Own Shares\nBritish Virgin Islands law and our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association impose no limitations on the right of\nnonresident or foreign owners to hold or vote our securities. There are no provisions in the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nSome provisions of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of\nour Company or management, that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and\nconvene general meetings of shareholders. Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association allow our shareholders holding\nshares representing in aggregate not less than thirty percent (30%) of our voting shares to requisition a special meeting of shareholders, in which\ncase our directors are obliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting.\nHowever, under British Virgin Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our Company.\nRegister of Members\nThe Company is required to keep a register of members containing (i) the names and addresses of the shareholders, (ii) the number of each class\nand series of shares held by each shareholder, (iii) the date on which the name of each shareholder was entered in the register of members, and (iv)\nthe date on which any person ceased to be a shareholder. A share is deemed to be issued when the name of the shareholder is entered in the register\nof members and the entry of the name of a person in the register of members as a holder of a share is prima facie evidence that legal title in the\nshare vests in that person.\nVariation of Rights of Shareholders\nIf at any time the shares are divided into different classes, the rights attached to any class may only be varied, whether or not the Company is in\nliquidation, by a resolution passed at a meeting by a majority of the votes cast by those entitled to vote at a meeting of the holders of the issued\nshares in that class.\nMeetings\nAny action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders may be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the shareholders\nentitled to vote on such action. An action that may be taken by the shareholders at a meeting (other than the election of Directors) may also be taken\nby a resolution of shareholders consented to in writing, without the need for any notice, but if any resolution of shareholders is adopted otherwise\nthan by the unanimous written consent of all shareholders, a copy of such resolution shall forthwith be sent to all shareholders not consenting to\nsuch resolution. All meetings of shareholders (whether annual or special) will be held on such dates and at such places as may be fixed from time to\ntime by the directors. The Company is not required to hold an annual general meeting in any calendar year. However, where so determined by the\ndirectors of the Company, an annual general meeting shall be held once in each calendar year at such date and time as may be determined by the\ndirectors of the Company.\nAt any meeting of shareholders, a quorum will be present if there are one or more shareholders present in person or by proxy representing not less\nthan 50% of the issued shares entitled to vote on the resolutions to be considered at the meeting. The shareholders present at a duly called or held\nmeeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of\nenough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to\nconstitute a quorum.\n78\nA shareholder may be represented at a meeting of shareholders by a proxy who may speak and vote on behalf of the shareholder. A shareholder will\nbe deemed to be present at the meeting if he participates by telephone or other electronic means and all shareholders participating in the meeting are\nable to hear each other.\nTransfer of Shares\nSubject to the restrictions and conditions in our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, as amended, and the Amended\nShareholders Agreement, any shareholder may transfer all or any of his or her shares by written instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and\ncontaining the name and address of the transferee. The transfer of a share is effective when the name of the transferee is entered on the register of\nmembers of the Company.\nRedemption of Shares\nThe Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its own shares for such consideration as the directors of the Company may\ndetermine if the directors are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the acquisition the value of the Company’s assets will exceed\nits liabilities and the Company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due. Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires may\nbe cancelled or held as treasury shares except to the extent that such shares are in excess of 50% of the issued shares in which case, they shall be\ncancelled to the extent of such excess, but they shall be available for reissue.\nDifferences Between the Law of Different Jurisdictions\nWe were incorporated under, and are governed by, the laws of the BVI. Set forth below is a summary of some of the differences between provisions\nof the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws application to companies incorporated in Delaware and their shareholders.\nDirector’s Fiduciary Duties\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two\ncomponents: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily\nprudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all\nmaterial information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he\nreasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty\nprohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest\npossessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are\npresumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the\ncorporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented\nconcerning a transaction by a director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to\nthe corporation.\nBVI law provides that every director of a BVI company in exercising his powers or performing his duties shall act honestly and in good faith and in\nwhat the director believes to be in the best interests of the company. Additionally, the director shall exercise the care, diligence, and skill that a\nreasonable director would exercise in the same circumstances, taking into account the nature of the company, the nature of the decision and the\nposition of the director and his responsibilities. In addition, BVI law provides that a director shall exercise his powers as a director for a proper\npurpose and shall not act, or agree to the company acting, in a manner that contravenes the Companies Act or the memorandum of association or\narticles of association of the company.\n79\nAmendment of Governing Documents\nUnder Delaware corporate law, with very limited exceptions, a vote of the shareholders is required to amend the certificate of incorporation. Under\nBVI law and our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, we may amend the Amended and Restated Memorandum and\nArticles of Association by resolution of shareholders or by resolution of directors, provided that no amendment may be made by resolution of\ndirectors: (a) to restrict the rights or powers of the shareholders to amend the memorandum of association or the articles of association; (b) to\nchange the percentage of shareholders required to pass a resolution of shareholders to amend the memorandum of association or the articles of\nassociation; (c) in circumstances where the memorandum of association or the articles of association cannot be amended by the shareholders; and\n(d) provided that the directors may not amend certain sections of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association that would\nnegatively affect existing shareholders.\nWritten Consent of Directors\nUnder Delaware corporate law, directors may act by written consent only on the basis of a unanimous vote. Under BVI law, directors’ consents need\nonly a majority of directors signing to take effect. Under our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, directors may act by\nwritten consents of all directors.\nWritten Consent of Shareholders\nUnder Delaware corporate law, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action to be taken at any annual or special meeting\nof shareholders of a corporation, may be taken by written consent of the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of\nvotes that would be necessary to take such action at a meeting. As permitted by BVI law, shareholders’ consents need only shareholders\nrepresenting a majority of votes of the shares entitled to vote signing to take effect. Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation provide that an action that may be taken by the shareholders at a meeting (other than the election of directors) may also be taken by a\nresolution of shareholders consented to in writing, without the need for any notice, but if any resolution of shareholders is adopted otherwise than\nby the unanimous written consent of all shareholders, a copy of such resolution shall forthwith be sent to all shareholders not consenting to such\nresolution.\nShareholder Proposals\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it complies with\nthe notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so\nin the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings. BVI law and our Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association provide that our directors shall call a meeting of the shareholders in respect of the matter for which the\nmeeting is requested in writing by shareholders entitled to exercise 30% or more of the voting rights.\nSale of Assets\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a vote of the shareholders is required to approve the sale of assets only when all or substantially all assets are being\nsold. In the BVI, shareholder approval is required when more than 50% of a company’s total assets by value are being disposed of or sold.\nDissolution; Winding Up\nUnder Delaware corporate law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by shareholders\nholding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a\nsimple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware corporate law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of\nincorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. As permitted by BVI law and our Amended\nand Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, we may by a resolution of shareholders or, subject to the requirements under our Amended\nand Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, by resolution of directors appoint a voluntary liquidator to undertake the liquidation of the\nCompany.\n80\nRedemption of Shares\nUnder Delaware corporate law, any stock may be made subject to redemption by the corporation at its option or at the option of the holders of such\nstock provided there remains outstanding shares with full voting power. Such stock may be made redeemable for cash, property or rights, as\nspecified in the certificate of incorporation or in the resolution of the board of directors providing for the issue of such stock. As permitted by BVI\nlaw and our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, we may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of our own\nshares for such consideration as our directors may determine if the directors are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the\nacquisition the value of our assets will exceed our liabilities and we will be able to pay our debts as they fall due. Shares that the Company\npurchases, redeems or otherwise acquires may be cancelled or held as treasury shares except to the extent that such shares are in excess of 50% of\nthe issued shares in which case they shall be cancelled to the extent of such excess but they shall be available for reissue.\nVariation of Rights of Shares\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of\nsuch class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by BVI law and our Amended and Restated Memorandum and\nArticles of Association, if at any time the shares are divided into different classes, the rights attached to any class may only be varied, whether or\nnot the Company is in liquidation, by a resolution passed at a meeting by a majority of the votes cast by those entitled to vote at a meeting of the\nholders of the issued shares in that class.\nRemoval of Directors\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of\nthe outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate provides otherwise. As permitted by BVI law and our Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association, a director or member of a committee of the board or the board of a subsidiary may be removed from his\nor her position, with cause, by the majority of the shareholders or the majority of the board; provided that (i) any director or member of a committee\nof the board or the board of a subsidiary that is appointed or nominated by the minority representative shall be removed from their position upon\nand only upon, the written request of the minority representative; and (ii) any director or member of a committee of the board or the board of a\nsubsidiary that is appointed or nominated by Digital Grid shall be removed from their position upon and only upon, the written request of Digital\nGrid.\nMergers\nUnder Delaware corporate law, one or more constituent corporations may merge into and become part of another constituent corporation in a\nprocess known as a merger. A Delaware corporation may merge with a foreign corporation as long as the law of the foreign jurisdiction permits\nsuch a merger. To effect a merger under Delaware General Corporation Law §251, an agreement of merger must be properly adopted and the\nagreement of merger or a certificate of merger must be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State. In order to be properly adopted, the agreement of\nmerger must be adopted by the board of directors of each constituent corporation by a resolution or unanimous written consent. In addition, the\nagreement of merger generally must be approved at a meeting of shareholders of each constituent corporation by a majority of the outstanding stock\nof the corporation entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides for a supermajority vote. In general, the surviving corporation\nassumes all of the assets and liabilities of the disappearing corporation or corporations as a result of the merger.\nUnder the Companies Act, two or more companies may merge or consolidate in accordance with the statutory provisions. A merger means the\nmerging of two or more constituent companies into one of the constituent companies, and a consolidation means the uniting of two or more\nconstituent companies into a new company. In order to merge or consolidate, the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan\nof merger or consolidation which must be authorized by a resolution of shareholders.\nShareholders not otherwise entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation may still acquire the right to vote if the plan of merger or consolidation\ncontains any provision which, if proposed as an amendment to the memorandum association or articles of association, would entitle them to vote as\na class or series on the proposed amendment. In any event, all shareholders must be given a copy of the plan of merger or consolidation irrespective\nof whether they are entitled to vote at the meeting or consent to the written resolution to approve the plan of merger or consolidation.\n81\nInspection of Books and Records\nUnder Delaware corporate law, any shareholder of a corporation may for any proper purpose inspect or make copies of the corporation’s stock\nledger, list of shareholders and other books and records.\nUnder the Companies Act, members of the general public, on payment of a nominal fee, can obtain copies of the public records of a company\navailable at the office of the Registrar which will include the company’s certificate of incorporation, its memorandum and articles of association\n(with any amendments) and records of license fees paid to date and will also disclose any articles of dissolution, articles of merger and a register of\ncharges if the company has elected to file such a register.\nA member of a company is entitled, on giving written notice to the company, to inspect:\na. the memorandum and articles;\nb. the register of members;\nc. the register of directors; and\nd. the minutes of meetings and resolutions of members and of those classes of members of which he is a member; and to make copies of or\ntake extracts from the documents and records referred to in (a) to (d) above.\nSubject to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, the directors may, if they are satisfied that it would be contrary to\nthe company’s interests to allow a member to inspect any document, or part of a document, specified in (b), (c) or (d) above, refuse to permit the\nmember to inspect the document or limit the inspection of the document, including limiting the making of copies or the taking of extracts from the\nrecords.\nWhere a company fails or refuses to permit a member to inspect a document or permits a member to inspect a document subject to limitations, that\nmember may apply to the British Virgin Islands Court for an order that he should be permitted to inspect the document or to inspect the document\nwithout limitation.\nTransactions with Interested Shareholders\nDelaware corporate law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the corporation has\nspecifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain\nbusiness combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An\ninterested shareholder generally is a person or group who or that owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting stock within the\npast three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders\nwould not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested\nshareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested\nshareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware public corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the\ntarget’s board of directors.\nBVI law has no comparable provision.\nCumulative Voting\nUnder Delaware corporate law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the company’s certificate of incorporation\nspecifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it\npermits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s\nvoting power with respect to electing such director. There are no prohibitions to cumulative voting under the laws of the BVI, but our Amended and\nRestated Memorandum and Articles of Association do not provide for cumulative voting.\n82\nC. Material Contracts\nExcept as otherwise disclosed in this annual report (including the Exhibits under Item 19), we are not currently, nor have we been for the past two\nyears, party to any material contract, other than contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nD. Exchange Controls\nBVI Exchange Controls\nThere are no material exchange controls restrictions on payment of dividends, interest or other payments to the holders of our common shares or on\nthe conduct of our operations in the BVI, where we were incorporated. There are no material BVI laws that impose any material exchange controls\non us or that affect the payment of dividends, interest or other payments to nonresident holders of our common shares. BVI law and our Amended\nand Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association do not impose any material limitations on the right of non-residents or foreign owners to\nhold or vote our common shares.\nE. Taxation\nBVI, PRC AND U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\nThe following is a general summary of certain material BVI, PRC and U.S. federal income tax considerations. The discussion is not intended to be,\nnor should it be construed as, legal or tax advice to any particular shareholder or prospective shareholder. The discussion is based on laws and\nrelevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change or different interpretations, possibly with\nretroactive effect.\nBVI Taxation\nThe BVI does not impose a withholding tax on dividends paid to holders of our common shares, nor does the BVI levy any capital gains or income\ntaxes on us. Further, a holder of our common shares who is not a tax resident of the BVI is exempt from the BVI income tax on dividends paid with\nrespect to the common shares. Holders of common shares are not subject to the BVI income tax on gains realized on the sale or disposition of the\ncommon shares.\nOur common shares are not subject to transfer taxes, stamp duties or similar charges in the BVI. However, as a company incorporated under the\nCompanies Act, we are required to pay the BVI government an annual license fee based on the number of shares we are authorized to issue.\nThere is no income tax treaty or convention currently in effect between the United States and the BVI.\nPRC Taxation\nWe are a holding company incorporated in the BVI, which directly holds our equity interests in our PRC operating subsidiaries. The EIT Law and\nits implementation rules, both of which became effective as of January 1, 2008, as amended on February 24, 2017, provide that a PRC enterprise is\nsubject to a standard income tax rate of 25% and China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC subsidiaries to its\noverseas parent, will normally be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10%, unless there are applicable treaties between the overseas parent’s\njurisdiction of incorporation and China to reduce such rate.\n83\nThe EIT Law also provides that enterprises organized under the laws of jurisdictions outside China with their “de facto management bodies” located\nwithin China may be considered PRC resident enterprises and therefore subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on their worldwide\nincome. Its implementation rules further define the term “de facto management body” as the management body that exercises substantial and\noverall management and control over the business, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. We do not consider the Company to be a\nPRC resident enterprise since our management team, which exercises substantial and overall management and control over the Company and its\noverseas subsidiaries, is located in the United States. If the PRC tax authorities determine that our BVI holding company is a “resident enterprise”\nfor PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. Under the EIT Law and its implementation\nregulations issued by the State Council, a 10% PRC withholding tax is applicable to dividends paid to investors that are non-resident enterprises,\nwhich do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC or which have such establishment or place of business but the dividends are not\neffectively connected with such establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. In\naddition, any gain realized on the transfer of shares by such investors is also subject to PRC tax at a rate of 10%, if such gain is regarded as income\nderived from sources within the PRC. If we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid on our common shares, and any gain realized\nfrom the transfer of our common shares, may be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and may as a result be subject to PRC\ntaxation. Furthermore, if we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid to individual investors who are non-PRC residents and any gain\nrealized on the transfer of common shares by such investors may be subject to PRC tax at a current rate of 20% (which in the case of dividends may\nbe withheld at source). Any PRC tax liability may be reduced under applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements between China and other\njurisdictions. If we or any of our subsidiaries established outside China are considered a PRC resident enterprise, it is unclear whether holders of our\ncommon shares would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between China and other countries or areas.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation\nWe believe that we are an inverted corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. This means that, notwithstanding that we are a company incorporated\nin the BVI, we believe that we will be treated for all U.S. federal tax purposes as if we are a U.S. corporation and that a holder of our common\nshares will be treated for all U.S. federal tax purposes as holding the stock of a U.S. corporation.\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the ownership and disposition of\nour common shares but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as\nestate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state or local tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code and U.S.\nTreasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service, or the IRS, in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any\nsuch change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect owners of our common shares. We have\nnot sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not\ntake a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our common shares.\nThis discussion is limited to beneficial owners that hold our common shares as a “capital asset” within the meaning of Section 1221(a) of the Code\n(generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the impact of the\nMedicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to certain types of investors subject to\nspecial rules, including, without limitation:\n● financial institutions or financial services entities;\n● broker-dealers;\n● governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;\n● regulated investment companies;\n● real estate investment trusts;\n● expatriates or former long-term residents of the U.S.;\n● persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more (by vote or value) of our shares;\n● insurance companies;\n● dealers or traders subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to the securities;\n● persons holding the securities as part of a “straddle,” constructive sale, hedge, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction;\n84\n● persons that purchase or sell our securities as part of a wash sale for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n● U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;\n● partnerships (or entities or arrangements classified as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and\nany beneficial owners of such entities;\n● tax-exempt entities;\n● controlled foreign corporations;\n● passive foreign investment companies; and\n● persons that acquired our securities as compensation or in connection with services.\nIf you are a partnership or other pass-through entity (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes), the U.S. federal income tax treatment of your partners, members or other beneficial owners will generally depend on\nthe status of the partners, members or other beneficial owners, your activities, and certain determinations made at the partner, member or other\nbeneficial owner level. If you are a partner, member or other beneficial owner of a partnership or other pass-through entity that acquires our\nsecurities, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our securities.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is any beneficial owner of our common shares that is:\n● an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n● a corporation (or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or\nunder the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;\n● an estate the income of which is includable in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or\n● a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more\nU.S. persons (as defined in the Code) have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect\nunder Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nTaxation of Distributions\nIf we pay distributions in cash or other property (other than certain distributions of our common shares or rights to acquire our common shares) to\nU.S. holders of our common shares, such distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid\nfrom our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of current and\naccumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. holder’s\nadjusted tax basis in our common shares. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the common\nshares and will be treated as described under “U.S. Holders — Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Our common shares” below.\nDividends we pay to a U.S. holder that is a taxable corporation generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction if the requisite holding\nperiod is satisfied. With certain exceptions and provided certain holding period requirements are met, dividends we pay to a non-corporate U.S.\nholder may constitute “qualified dividend income” that will be subject to tax at the applicable tax rate accorded to long-term capital gains. If the\nholding period requirements are not satisfied, then a corporation may not be able to qualify for the dividends received deduction and would have\ntaxable income equal to the entire dividend amount, and non-corporate holders may be subject to tax on such dividend at regular ordinary income\ntax rates instead of the preferential rate that applies to qualified dividend income.\nSale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Our Common Shares\nSubject to the discussion below under “U.S. Holders — Redemption of Our Common Shares,” upon a sale, taxable exchange or other taxable\ndisposition of our common shares, a U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the\namount realized and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such common shares. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital\ngain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for the common shares so disposed of exceeds one year. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-\ncorporate U.S. holders currently will be eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n85\nRedemption of Our Common Shares\nIn the event that a U.S. holder’s common shares is redeemed or if we purchase a U.S. holder’s common shares in an open market transaction (such\nopen market purchase of common shares by us is referred to as a “redemption” for the remainder of this discussion), the treatment of the transaction\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the common shares under Section 302 of the\nCode. Under these rules, the redemption generally will be treated as a sale of the common shares (rather than as a distribution) if the redemption (i)\nis “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. holder, (ii) results in a “complete termination” of the U.S. holder’s interest in us or (iii) is\n“not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the U.S. holder. In determining whether any of these tests have been met, shares\nconsidered to be owned by the U.S. holder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the Code, as well as shares actually owned,\nmust generally be taken into account. Because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of Section 302 of the Code is satisfied\nwith respect to any particular holder of the stock will depend upon the facts and circumstances as of the time the determination is made, U.S.\nholders should consult their tax advisors to determine such tax treatment.\nIf the redemption qualifies as a sale of common shares, the U.S. holder will be treated as described under “U.S. Holders — Sale, Taxable Exchange\nor Other Taxable Disposition of Our Common Shares” above. If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of our common shares, the U.S. holder\nwill be treated as receiving a distribution with the tax consequences described above under “U.S. Holders — Taxation of Distributions.” The\namount of the distribution would be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received by the U.S. holder and any\nremaining tax basis of the U.S. holder in the redeemed common shares would be added to the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining\ncommon shares. If the U.S. holder has no remaining common shares, such basis may, under certain circumstances, be transferred to a related person\nor it may be lost entirely.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nIn general, information reporting requirements may apply to dividends paid to a U.S. holder and to the proceeds of the sale, taxable exchange or\nother taxable disposition of our common shares unless the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient. Backup withholding may apply to such payments if\nthe U.S. holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number, a certification of exempt status or has been notified by the IRS that it is subject to\nbackup withholding (and such notification has not been withdrawn).\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against a U.S.\nholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a Non-U.S. holder is any beneficial owner of our common shares that is neither a “U.S. person” nor an entity or\narrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nTaxation of Distributions\nIf we pay distributions in cash or other property (other than certain distributions of our common shares or rights to acquire our common shares) to\nNon-U.S. holders of our common shares, such distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent\npaid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the Non-\nU.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common shares. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the\ncommon shares and will be treated as described under “Non-U.S. Holders — Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Our Common\nShares.”\n86\nSubject to the discussions below on effectively connected income, dividends paid to a Non-U.S. holder of our common shares will be subject to\nU.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty,\nprovided the Non-U.S. holder furnishes a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) certifying qualification for\nthe lower treaty rate). A Non-U.S. holder that does not timely furnish the required documentation, but that qualifies for a reduced treaty rate, may\nobtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.\nIf dividends paid to a Non-U.S. holder are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States\n(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such\ndividends are attributable), the Non-U.S. holder will be exempt from the U.S. federal withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the\nNon-U.S. holder generally must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are effectively\nconnected with the Non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States.\nAny such effectively connected dividends will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis at the regular graduated rates. A Non-U.S. holder\nthat is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on\nsuch effectively connected dividends, as adjusted for certain items.\nNon-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules.\nSale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Our Common Shares\nSubject to the discussion below under “Non-U.S. Holders — Redemption of Our Common Shares,” a Non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale, taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of our common shares unless:\n● the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such gain is\nattributable);\n● the Non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the\ndisposition and certain other requirements are met; or\n● our common shares constitute a U.S. real property interest, or USRPI, by reason of our status as a U.S. real property holding corporation,\nor USRPHC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated\nrates. A Non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items.\nGain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. holder, provided the Non-U.S. holder has timely\nfiled U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, we believe we currently are not, and do not anticipate becoming, a USRPHC. Because the\ndetermination of whether we are a USRPHC depends, however, on the fair market value of our USRPIs relative to the fair market value of our non-\nU.S. real property interests and our other business assets, there can be no assurance we currently are not a USRPHC or will not become one in the\nfuture. Even if we are or were to become a USRPHC, gain arising from the sale or other taxable disposition by a Non-U.S. holder of our common\nshares will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if our common shares is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on\nan established securities market, and such Non-U.S. holder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common shares throughout the\nshorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or other taxable disposition and the Non-U.S. holder’s holding period.\n87\nNon-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.\nRedemption of Our Common Shares\nThe characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the redemption of a Non-U.S. holder’s common shares generally will correspond to the\nU.S. federal income tax characterization of such a redemption of a U.S. holder’s common shares, as described under “U.S. Holders — Redemption\nof Our common shares” above, and the consequences of the redemption to the Non-U.S. holder will be as described above under “Non-U.S. Holders\n— Taxation of Distributions” and “Non-U.S. Holders — Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Our common shares,” as\napplicable. Because it may not be certain at the time a Non-U.S. holder is redeemed whether such Non-U.S. holder’s redemption will be treated as a\nsale of shares or a distribution constituting a dividend, and because such determination will depend in part on a Non-U.S. holder’s particular\ncircumstances, we or the applicable withholding agent may not be able to determine whether (or to what extent) a Non-U.S. holder is treated as\nreceiving a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, we or the applicable withholding agent may withhold tax at a rate of 30% on\nthe gross amount of any consideration paid to a Non-U.S. holder in redemption of such Non-U.S. holder’s common shares unless special procedures\nare available to Non-U.S. holders to certify that they are entitled to exemptions from, or reductions in, such withholding tax. However, there can be\nno assurance that such special certification procedures will be available. A Non-U.S. holder generally may obtain a refund of any such excess\namounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the\napplication of the foregoing rules in light of their particular facts and circumstances.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of dividends on our common shares will not be subject to backup withholding, provided the applicable withholding agent does not have\nactual knowledge or reason to know the Non-U.S. holder is a United States person and the Non-U.S. holder either certifies its non-U.S. status, such\nas by furnishing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, or otherwise establishes an exemption. However, information returns are\nrequired to be filed with the IRS in connection with any dividends on our common shares paid to the Non-U.S. holder, regardless of whether any tax\nwas actually withheld. In addition, proceeds of the sale, taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of our common shares within the United\nStates or conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting, if the\napplicable withholding agent receives the certification described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such Non-U.S.\nholder is a United States person, or the Non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds of a disposition of our common shares\nconducted through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting.\nCopies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions of an applicable treaty or agreement to the\ntax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. holder resides or is established.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit\nagainst a Non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nAll Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of information reporting and backup withholding to them.\n88\nFATCA Withholding Taxes\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (commonly referred to\nas the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act” or “FATCA”) generally impose withholding of 30% on payments of dividends (including\nconstructive dividends) on our common shares to “foreign financial institutions” (which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes\ninvestment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally\nrelating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied by, or an exemption applies to, the payee\n(typically certified as to by the delivery of a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E). The IRS has issued proposed regulations (on which\ntaxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued) that provide that these withholding requirements would generally not apply to gross proceeds\nfrom sales or other dispositions of our common shares. However, there can be no assurance that final Treasury regulations will provide the same\nexceptions from FATCA withholding as the proposed Treasury regulations. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an\nintergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S.\nholder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such withholding taxes, and a Non-U.S. holder might be required to file a U.S. federal income tax\nreturn to claim such refunds or credits. Similarly, dividends in respect of our common shares held by an investor that is a non-financial non-U.S.\nentity that does not qualify under certain exceptions will generally be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (1) certifies\nto us or the applicable withholding agent that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners” or (2) provides certain information\nregarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners,” which will in turn be provided to the U.S. Department of Treasury. Prospective investors\nshould consult their tax advisors regarding the effects of FATCA on their investment in our common shares.\nF. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\nG.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe do not use financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, and do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to\nsignificant market risk. Our primary market risk exposures are changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations.\n89\nInterest rate risk\nOur main interest rate exposure relates to long-term borrowings that we obtain from banks and financial institutions to meet our working capital\nexpenditure requirements. We also have interest-bearing assets, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and loans to affiliates. We\nmanage our interest rate exposure with a focus on reducing our overall cost of debt and exposure to changes in interest rates. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, we had outstanding long-term borrowings in the aggregate amount of $1.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, with the majority\nof our long-term borrowings having floating interest rates.\nWe have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk. We have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in\nmarket interest rates. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates in\nthe future.\nForeign currency risk\nWe have currency fluctuation exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. Significant changes in exchange\nrates between foreign currencies in which we transact business and the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition. Historically, we have not entered into any hedging activities, and, to the extent that we continue not to do so in the future, we may be\nvulnerable to the effects of currency exchange-rate fluctuations.\nWe expect our exposure to foreign currency risk will increase as we increase our operations and sales in Canada and other countries and regions.\nAlthough the effect of currency fluctuations on our financial statements has not been material in the past, there can be no assurance that the effect of\ncurrency fluctuations will not be material in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded foreign exchange gain\nof $0.3 million, gain of $0.9 million, and loss of $3.3 million, respectively. Based on the balance of our foreign-denominated cash and cash\nequivalents as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, an assumed 10% negative currency movement would not have a material impact.\nTo date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.\nItem 12.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as of December 31, 2023. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by\na company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nBased on the evaluation performed as of December 31, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, because of the inherent\nlimitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or\nthat all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company will be detected.\nRemediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable\npossibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As\ndescribed in Item 15 of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, we previously determined that we had material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. These material weaknesses were as follows.\n● Management did not maintain effective general controls over information systems that support the financial reporting process.\n● Management did not implement controls to address relevant risks in certain business processes.\n● Management did not implement and operate review controls with a sufficient precision level or threshold of investigation to detect material\nmisstatements within its financial statements.\n● Management did not retain documentation to sufficiently evidence that certain review procedures were performed.\n● Management did not implement and operate controls over the completeness and accuracy of certain reports and underlying data used in the\noperation of certain controls within its financial reporting process.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented enhanced procedures to remediate the deficiencies in our internal control over financial\nreporting that resulted in the material weaknesses. These procedures included, but were not limited to:\n● We designed and implemented information technology general controls and business process application controls in our financial systems\nto support our information processing objectives; and\n● We designed and implemented significant process transaction flows and key controls in the Company’s business processes, including\nrevenue, inventory, financial reporting & close, payroll, accounts payable, fixed assets, enterprise incentives, stock compensation, treasury,\nand tax; and\n● We designed, implemented and formalized review controls over the review and approval of journal entries, account reconciliations certain\naccounting analyses, and the financial statement presentation and disclosure review process, including more comprehensive documentation\nand formalization of the existence and operating effectiveness of internal controls; and\n91\n● We enhanced and implemented controls around automated completeness and accuracy testing over key reports used in financial reporting\nprocess.\nBased on the results of our remediation plan and assessment, we have concluded that the material weaknesses in internal control over financial\nreporting described above have been successfully remediated as of December 31, 2023. However, completion of remediation for these material\nweaknesses does not provide assurance that our remediated controls will continue to operate properly and as a result, that our financial statements\nwill be free from material error.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange\nAct Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, its\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by such company’s board of directors, management and other personnel to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n● pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets\nof the company;\n● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n● provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an\nassessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, using the criteria described in Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this\nassessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nExcept as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) that occurred during the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nItem 16. [Reserved]\nItem 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert\nOur board of directors has determined that each director appointed to the audit committee is financially literate and is independent as defined under\nNasdaq Listing Rules. Our board also has determined that Mr. Gregory Moore qualifies as an audit committee financial expert within the meaning\nof the SEC rules or possesses financial sophistication within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Refer to “Item 6 Directors, Senior\nManagement and Employees” for further detail on each of their backgrounds.\nItem 16B. Code of Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is posted on our website at www.newegg.com/corporate/about, that applies to all\nemployees and each of officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer. Written copies of the\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics are available free of charge upon written request to us at the address on the first page of this annual report. If\nwe make any substantive amendments to the code of ethics or grant any waivers, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of these codes to\nour chief executive officer or chief financial officer, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website.\nItem 16C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services\nOur principal accountants for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were BDO USA, P.C. (“BDO USA”). We incurred the\nfollowing fees from BDO USA for professional services for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nPrincipal Accountant Fees (U.S. Dollars in thousands)\nAudit Fees $ 1,365 $ 1,708\nTax fees — —\nAudit-related fees — —\nAll other fees — —\nTotal fees $ 1,365 $ 1,708\n92\n“Audit fees” are the aggregate fees earned by BDO USA for the audit of our consolidated annual financial statements, reviews of interim financial\nstatements and attestation services that are provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.\n“Tax fees” are the aggregate fees charged by BDO USA for professional services rendered for tax compliance activities.\n“Audit-related fees” are fees charged by the BDO USA for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit\nor review of our financial statements and are not reported under “Audit fees.” This category comprises fees for agreed-upon procedures\nengagements and other attestation services subject to regulatory requirements.\n“All other fees” are fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by BDO USA, other than the services reported\nin the aforementioned categories in this section.\nThe policy of our audit committee or our board of directors is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by our principal accountant,\nincluding audit services, audit-related services, and other services as described above. All of the services provided by our auditors described above\nhave been pre-approved by our audit committee.\nItem 16D. Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committees\nNot applicable.\nItem 16E. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nIn November 2023, the Board approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may purchase up to $10 million of our outstanding\nCommon Shares. The share repurchase program expires on November 8, 2025. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase\nany particular amount of Common Shares and may be modified, suspended or terminated by us at any time without notice. There is no minimum\nnumber of shares that we are required to repurchase. Shares repurchased under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated\ntransactions or by other means, including through trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934\nand accelerated share repurchase agreements, with the amount and timing of repurchase to be determined at our discretion, depending on market\nand business conditions, and prevailing stock prices among other factors.\nThe following table presents our purchases of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2023, as part of the publicly announced share\nrepurchase program:\nTotal\nNumber of Approximate\nShares Dollar Value\nPurchased as of Shares\nPart of That May Yet\nPublicly Average Price Be Purchased\nAnnounced Paid Per Under the\n(Dollar in millions, except per share data) Program Share Program\nNovember 9, 2023 – November 30, 2023 — $ — 10.0\nDecember 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023 — — 10.0\nTotal —\nItem 16F. Change in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant\nNone.\n93\nItem 16G. Corporate Governance\nNewegg Commerce, Inc. (previously known as “Lianluo Smart Limited”) was incorporated as an international business company under the\nInternational Business Companies Act, 1984, in the British Virgin Islands on July 22, 2003.\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act. As such we are exempt from certain provisions of the\nsecurities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. As a foreign private issuer, the information we are\nrequired to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic\nissuers. In addition, as a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to\ncorporate governance matters that differ significantly from the Nasdaq Listing Rules. We rely on home country practice to be exempted from some\nof Nasdaq’s corporate governance requirements. For instance, unlike the requirements of Nasdaq, we are not required, under the BVI Business\nCompanies Act, 2004, as amended (the “Companies Act”), to have our board consist of a majority of independent directors, nor are we required to\nhave a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee consisting entirely of independent directors or have regular\nexecutive sessions with only independent directors each year. These practices may afford less protection to shareholders than they would enjoy if\nwe complied fully with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nItem 16H. Mine Safety Disclosure\nNot applicable.\nItem 16I. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\nItem 16J. Insider Trading Policies\nNot applicable.\nItem 16K. Cybersecurity\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use, store, and transmit digitally large amounts of confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and\npersonal information. The secure maintenance of this information and our information technology systems is important to our operations and\nbusiness strategy. To this end, we have implemented processes designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from potential unauthorized\noccurrences on or through our information technology systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\nthese systems and the data residing therein. These processes are managed and monitored by a dedicated information security team, which is led by\nour Chief Information Security Officer, and include mechanisms, controls, technologies, systems, and other processes designed to prevent or\nmitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data and maintain a stable information technology\nenvironment. For example, we conduct penetration and vulnerability testing, data recovery testing, security audits, and ongoing risk assessments,\nincluding due diligence on and audits of our key technology vendors contractors and suppliers. We have an incident response plan designed to\nmitigate and remediate identified cybersecurity incidents and escalate certain incidents as appropriate to management and the Audit Committee.\nAdditionally, we leverage outsourced managed services to monitor our systems and utilize bug bounty programs designed to identify and remediate\nvulnerabilities. We also conduct periodic employee awareness trainings on cyber and information security, among other topics. In addition, we\nconsult with outside advisors and experts, when appropriate, to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks, including to\nanticipate future threats and trends, and their impact on the Company’s risk environment.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer, Montaque Hou, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and has over ten years of experience\nmanaging information technology and cybersecurity matters, together with our information technology team, is responsible for assessing and\nmanaging cybersecurity risks. We consider cybersecurity, along with other significant risks that we face, within our overall enterprise risk\nmanagement framework. In the last fiscal year, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior\ncybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us, but we face certain ongoing cybersecurity risks threats that, if realized, are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect us. Additional information on cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Item 3D, “Risk Factors,” under the heading\n“Operational Risks – A significant inadvertent disclosure or breach of confidential personal information we hold could be detrimental to our\nbusiness, reputation and results of operations.”\nThe Board of Directors, as a whole and at the committee level, has oversight for the most significant risks facing us and for our processes to\nidentify, prioritize, assess, manage, and mitigate those risks. The Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has been\ndesignated by our Board to oversee cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee receives periodic updates on cybersecurity and information\ntechnology matters and related risk exposures from our Chief Information Security Officer.\n94\nPART III\nItem 17. Financial Statements\nWe have responded to Item 18 in lieu of responding to this item.\nItem 18. Financial Statements\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE\nPage\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (BDO USA, P.C.; LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; F-2\nPCAOB ID #243)\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS F-3\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS F-4\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) F-5\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY F-6\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS F-7\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-8\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nStockholders and Board of Directors\nNewegg Commerce, Inc.\nCity of Industry, California\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newegg Commerce, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The\nCompany is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we\nare required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical\naudit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nVendor Incentive Receivables\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s vendor incentive receivables totaled $57.1 million as of December\n31, 2023. The Company participates in various vendor incentive programs that include, but are not limited to, purchasing-based volume discounts,\nsales-based volume incentives, marketing development funds, including certain cooperative advertising and price protection agreements.\nWe identified management’s measurement of vendor incentive receivables as a critical audit matter because the Company has a significant number\nof vendor agreements with various terms and conditions that may require estimates in order to determine the receivable amounts earned. Auditing\nthese vendor incentive receivables was complex due to the extent of audit effort required to evaluate whether the vendor incentive receivables were\nearned and recorded in accordance with the terms and conditions of vendor agreements.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n● Testing vendor incentive receivables, including the reasonableness of management’s assumptions, by:\no Confirming a sample of vendor incentive receivables with the vendors,\no Recalculating the vendor incentive receivables in accordance with the terms and conditions of the vendor contracts, which involved:\n■ Evaluating the terms of the contract,\n■ Obtaining invoices, credit memos, or other documentation provided to vendors, and comparing recorded incentives to\ntransactional data,\n■ Evaluating evidence of collectability of vendor incentive receivables.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.\nLos Angeles,

Organization and Description of Business\nNewegg Commerce, Inc. (“Newegg” or the “Company”) (previously known as “Lianluo Smart Limited” or “LLIT”) was incorporated as an\ninternational business company under the International Business Companies Act, 1984, in the British Virgin Islands on July 22, 2003.\nNewegg is an electronics-focused e-retailer that offers customers a comprehensive selection of the latest consumer electronics products,\ndetailed product descriptions and images, “how-to” information, and customer reviews via its websites. The Company’s strategic focus is based\non three key areas: (1) providing a differentiated and superior online shopping experience, (2) offering reliable and timely product fulfillment,\nand (3) delivering superior customer service.\nNewegg Inc. was incorporated as Newegg Computers in the state of California on February 4, 2000. In June 2005, Newegg Inc. was\nincorporated in the state of Delaware. On September 29, 2005, Newegg Computers was merged into Newegg Inc. under Delaware law with\nNewegg Inc. being the surviving company.\nIn August 2016, Newegg Inc. entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Hangzhou Liaison Interactive\nInformation Technology Co., Ltd, (“Hangzhou Lianluo”), a publicly traded company in China. The transaction was completed on March 30,\n2017. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Hangzhou Lianluo purchased 490,706 shares of Newegg Inc.’s Class A Common Stock and\n12,782,546 shares of Newegg Inc.’s Series A convertible Preferred Stock from existing shareholders for a total consideration of $91.9 million.\nAdditionally, Newegg Inc. issued, and Hangzhou Lianluo purchased, 24,870,027 shares of Newegg Inc.’s Series AA Convertible Preferred\nStock for a total consideration of $172.2 million. Upon the close of this transaction, Hangzhou Lianluo, through Digital Grid (Hong Kong)\nTechnology Co., Limited (“Digital Grid”), a fully-owned subsidiary of Hangzhou Lianluo, became the majority owner of Newegg Inc.\nOn May 19, 2021, the Company closed the merger with Newegg Inc. contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 23,\n2020, by and among LLIT, Lightning Delaware Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany, and Newegg Inc. As the consideration for the merger, the Company issued to all the stockholders of Newegg Inc. an aggregate of\n363,325,542 common shares. Each issued and outstanding share of Newegg Inc. capital stock was exchanged for 5.8417 shares of common\nshares of the Company. The Company also converted each Class B common share into one common share immediately prior to completion of\nthe merger.\nOn May 19, 2021, the Company disposed all of LLIT’s legacy business contemplated by that certain Equity Transfer Agreement dated\nOctober 23, 2020, by and among LLIT, its wholly owned subsidiary, Lianluo Connection Medical Wearable Device Technology (Beijing) Co.,\nLtd (“Lianluo Connection”), and Beijing Fenjin Times Development Co., Ltd. (“Beijing Fenjin”). The Company sold all of its equity interests\nin Lianluo Connection to Beijing Fenjin immediately following completion of the merger for a purchase price of RMB 0.\nIn May 2021, the Company changed its name from Lianluo Smart Limited to Newegg Commerce, Inc., and on May 20, 2021 changed its\nNasdaq stock ticker from LLIT to NEGG.\n2. Basis of Presentation\nThe merger is accounted for as a transfer of assets under common control in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, LLIT did not meet the definition of a business as of the close of\nthe transaction and was considered a group of assets. Newegg Inc. was deemed to be the receiving entity in the common control transaction,\nconsequently, the transaction is treated similar to a recapitalization of Newegg Inc. Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results\nof operations of Newegg Inc. became the historical financial statements. The assets and liabilities of LLIT were combined with Newegg Inc.\nusing its carryover basis on the transfer date. The carrying value of the net assets received by Newegg on May 19, 2021 was approximately\n$8.4 million. The assets were primarily comprised of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $11.4 million, marketable securities of $0.2\nmillion, and prepaid and other assets of $0.5 million. The liabilities received were primarily comprised of warrant liabilities of $1.2 million and\naccrued expenses and other liabilities of $2.5 million.\nThe recapitalization of the number of shares of capital stock attributable to Newegg Inc. is reflected retroactively as shares reflecting the\nexchange ratio of 5.8417 to the earliest period presented and is utilized for calculating earnings per share in all prior periods presented along\nwith certain other related disclosures.\nOn the date of the transfer, the Company subsequently disposed Lianluo Connection which had a carrying value of negative $2.0 million for $0\nconsideration and recognized a gain of $2.0 million, which is included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year\nended December 31, 2021.\n3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\na. Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of all\nconsolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nF-8\nb. Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are\nused for, but not limited to, revenue recognition, incentives earned from vendors, allowance for credit losses, investment valuation,\nvaluation allowance for deferred tax assets, and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from such estimates.\nc. Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nd. Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts. Cash equivalents are\nall highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposits which, at\ntimes, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes it is not\nexposed to any significant credit risk of cash and cash equivalents. Amounts receivable from credit card processors are also considered\ncash equivalents as they are both short term and highly liquid in nature and are typically converted to cash within three business days.\nAmounts due to the Company from credit card processors that are classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.9 million and $13.0\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\ne. Restricted Cash\nRestricted cash includes amounts deposited in commercial bank time deposits and money market accounts to collateralize the Company’s\ndeposit obligations. The Company considers restricted cash related to obligations classified as current liabilities to be current assets and\nrestricted cash related to obligations classified as long-term liabilities as noncurrent assets. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\nhad $4.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in restricted cash, primarily related to collateralization required pursuant to a credit card\nagreement and the restricted cash account required under the Company’s health insurance plan. The restricted cash balance is classified as\na current asset in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following is a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 102,512 $ 122,559\nRestricted cash 3,962 947\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 106,474 $ 123,506\nf. Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consist primarily of vendor receivables, which do not bear interest, and represent amounts due for marketing\ndevelopment funds, cooperative advertising, price protection and other incentive programs offered to the Company by certain vendors.\nAccounts receivable also include receivables from business customers generally, on 30-day to 60-day credit terms. On January 1, 2020, the\nCompany adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13 (as amended through March 2020), Financial Instruments — Credit\nLosses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The Company estimates the provision for credit losses based\non historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accounts receivables are written off when deemed\nuncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. Amounts receivable from business\ncustomers were $20.7 million and $19.4 million, net of allowances of $0.2 million and $1.0 million, at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. See further discussion of amounts receivable related to vendor incentive programs under Incentives Earned from Vendors\nbelow.\ng. Inventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and are valued at the\nlower of cost and net realizable value. In-bound freight-related costs are included as part of the cost of merchandise held for resale. In\naddition, certain vendor payments are deducted from the cost of merchandise held for resale. The Company records an inventory provision\nfor refurbished, slow-moving, or obsolete inventories based on historical experience and assumptions of future demand for product. These\nallowances are released when the related inventory is sold or disposed of. Amounts of inventory allowances were $3.9 million and $5.5\nmillion, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nF-9\n\nh. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization and depreciation computed using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful life of each asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining lease term or the estimated\nuseful life of the assets. Expenditures for repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, and expenditures for major renewals and\nimprovements are capitalized. Costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software and website development\nare capitalized and included in property and equipment. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated\ndepreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of\noperations. The useful lives for depreciable assets are as follows:\nBuildings 20 – 39 years\nMachinery and equipment 3 – 7 years\nComputer and software 3 – 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of lease term or 10 years\nCapitalized software 3 – 5 years\nFurniture and fixtures 5– 7 years\ni. Leases\nThe Company defines lease agreements at their inception as either operating or finance leases depending on certain defined criteria.\nCertain lease agreements may entitle the Company to receive rent holidays, other incentives, or periodic payment increases over the lease\nterm. Accordingly, rent expense under operating leases is recognized on the straight-line basis over the original lease term, inclusive of\npredetermined minimum rent escalations or modifications and rent holidays.\nj. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The impairment test consists of two steps. The first step compares the carrying\namount of the asset to the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows exceeds\nthe carrying amount of the asset, no impairment is taken. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying\namount of the asset, a second step is warranted and an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the\nasset exceeds its fair value calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows. There have been no impairment losses\nrecognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nk. Investments\nInvestments are accounted for using the equity method if the investment provides the Company the ability to exercise significant influence,\nbut not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has an ownership interest in the voting\nstock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors are considered in determining whether the equity method is\nappropriate. Also, investments in limited partnerships of more than 3% to 5% are generally viewed as more than minor and are accounted\nfor using the equity method.\nF-10\nThe investments for which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values were accounted for under the cost method prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall\n(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Subsequent to the adoption of this\nstandard as of January 1, 2018, the Company has elected the measurement alternative to measure such investments at cost, less any\nimpairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment\nof the same issuer.\nEquity investments, except for those accounted under ASU 2016-01 equity method, are measured at fair value, and any changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in earnings. For equity investments measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings, the\nCompany does not assess whether those securities are impaired.\nl. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, a three-tier fair value hierarchy\nprioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active\nmarkets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3,\ndefined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exist, therefore, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions to\ndetermine the best estimate of fair value.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued and other liabilities approximate\nfair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of long-term debt and line of credit at December 31,\n2023 and 2022 approximate fair value because the interest rate approximates the current market interest rate. The fair value of these\nfinancial instruments was determined using level 2 input.\nm. Warrant Liability\nFor warrants that are not indexed to the Company’s stock, the Company records the fair value of the issued warrants as a liability at each\nbalance sheet date and records changes in the estimated fair value as a non-cash gain or loss in the consolidated statement of income and\ncomprehensive income. The warrant liability is recognized in the balance sheet at the fair value (level 3). The fair value of these warrants\nhas been determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Black-Scholes pricing model provides for assumptions regarding\nvolatility, call and put features and risk-free interest rates within the total period to maturity (see Note 13 - Warrants).\nn. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and adjustments to stockholders’ equity for foreign currency translation\nadjustments. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments. The tax impact\nis not material to the consolidated financial statements.\no. Revenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of a promised product or service transfers to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration\nto which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring that product or service. Revenue is recognized net of sales taxes\nand discounts. The Company primarily generates revenue through product and extended warranty sales on its platforms, through fees\nearned for facilitating marketplace transactions, and services rendered through its Newegg Partner Services (“NPS”).\nF-11\nThe Company recognizes revenue on product sales at a point in time to customers when control of the product passes to the customer upon\ndelivery to the customer or when service is provided. The Company fulfills orders with its owned inventory or with inventory sourced\nthrough its suppliers. The vast majority of the Company’s product sales are fulfilled from its owned inventory. The amount recognized in\nrevenue represents the expected consideration to be received in exchange for such goods or services. For orders fulfilled with inventory\nsourced through the Company’s suppliers, and where the products are shipped directly by the Company’s supplier to the Company’s\ncustomer, the Company evaluates the criteria outlined in ASC 606-10-55, Principal versus Agent Considerations, in determining whether\nrevenue should be recognized on a gross or net basis. The Company determined that it is the principal in these transactions as it controls\nthe specific good before it is transferred to the customer. The Company is the entity responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the\nspecified good to the customer and takes responsibility for the acceptability of the goods, assumes inventory risk before the specified good\nhas been transferred to the customer or after transfer of control to the customer, has discretion in establishing the price, and selects the\nsuppliers of products sold. The Company accounts for product sales under these arrangements on a gross basis upon receipt of the product\nby the customer. Product sales exceeded 94% of consolidated net sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company generally requires payment by credit card upon placement of an order, and to a limited extent, grants credit to business\ncustomers, typically on 30-day to 60-day terms. Shipping and handling is considered a fulfillment activity, as it takes place before the\ncustomer obtains controls of the good. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales upon completion of\nthe performance obligation.\nThe Company’s product sales contracts include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price such as sales returns and credit\ncard chargebacks. As such, the transaction price for product sales includes estimates of variable consideration to the extent it is probable\nthat a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. Sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances and credit card\nchargebacks, based on historical experience.\nThe Company also earns fees for facilitating marketplace transactions and extended warranty sales on its platforms. For marketplace\ntransactions, the Company’s websites host third-party sellers and the Company also provides the payment processing function. The\nCompany recognizes revenue upon sale of products made available through its marketplace store. The Company is not the principal in this\narrangement and does not control the specific goods sold to the customer. The Company reports the net amount earned as commissions,\nwhich are determined using a fixed percentage of the sales price or fixed reimbursement amount. The Company also offers extended\nwarranty programs for various products on behalf of an unrelated third party. The Company reports the net amount earned as revenue at the\ntime of sale, as it is not the principal in this arrangement and does not control the specific goods sold to the customer.\nThe Company offers its customers the opportunity to purchase goods and services on its websites using deferred financing promotional\nprograms provided by a third-party financing company. These programs include an option to make no payments for a period of six, twelve,\neighteen or twenty-four months. The third-party financing company makes all decisions to extend credit to the customer under a separate\nagreement with the customer, owns all such receivables from the customer, assumes all risk of collection, and has no recourse to the\nCompany in the event the customer does not pay. The third-party financing company pays the Company for the purchase price on behalf of\nthe customer, less certain transaction fees. Accordingly, sales generated through these programs are not reflected in the Company’s\nreceivables once payment is received from the third-party financing company. The transaction fee paid by the Company to the third-party\nfinancing company is recognized as a reduction of revenue. These transaction fees for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nwere immaterial.\nTo the extent that the Company sells its products on third-party platforms, the Company incurs incremental contract acquisition costs in the\nform of sales commissions paid to the platforms. The commissions are generally determined based on the sales price and an agreed-upon\ncommission rate. The Company elects the practical expedient under Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 Revenue From Contracts\nwith Customers (Topic 606) to recognize sales commission as an expense as incurred, as the amortization period of the asset that the\nCompany otherwise would have recognized is less than one year.\nF-12\nThe Company offers e-commerce solutions to its vendors and sellers through its Newegg Partner Services. Part of the services include\nthird-party logistics (3PL), Shipped-by-Newegg (SBN), shipping label service (SLS), staffing, and media services. The fees we earn from\nthese arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered. For 3PL, SBN, and SLS, the revenues are recognized upon the shipment\nof the product to its end consumer, and upon processing of a returned item for the client. For staffing, revenues are recognized based on\nwhen an employee is dispatched to a client, hours are accumulated by the dispatched employees’ timecard, or when a direct hire placement\nis made. For media services, revenues are recognized when the applicable commercial or editorial creative content is delivered.\nThe Company has two types of contractual liabilities: (1) amounts collected, or amounts invoiced and due, related to product sales where\nreceipt of the product by the customer has not yet occurred or revenue cannot be recognized. Such amounts are recorded in the\nconsolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue and are recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.\nFor all of the product sales, the Company ships a large volume of packages through multiple carriers. Actual delivery dates may not always\nbe available and as such, the Company estimates delivery dates as needed based on historical data. (2) unredeemed gift cards, which are\ninitially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized in the period they are redeemed. Subject to governmental agencies’ escheat\nrequirements, certain gift cards not expected to be redeemed, also known as “breakage,” are recognized as revenue based on the historical\nredemption pattern. These gift cards breakage revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were immaterial.\nDeferred revenue totaled $25.6 million and $31.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company recognized $27.6 million of net revenue included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2022. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $36.6 million of net revenue included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2021.\np. Cost of Sales\nThe Company’s cost of sales represents the purchase price of the products it sells to its customers, offset by incentives earned from\nvendors, including marketing development funds and other vendor incentive programs. See further discussion of vendor payments under\nIncentives Earned from Vendors below. Cost of sales also includes freight-in and freight-out costs and charges related to refurbished, slow-\nmoving, or obsolete inventory along with payroll and benefit costs related to the Newegg Partner Services.\nq. Shipping and Handling\nThe Company records revenue for shipping and handling billed to its customers. Shipping and handling revenue totaled approximately\n$12.1 million, $15.3 million and $25.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs totaled approximately $45.9 million,\n$49.2 million and $64.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nr. Incentives Earned from Vendors\nThe Company participates in various vendor incentive programs that include, but are not limited to, purchasing-based volume discounts,\nsales-based volume incentives, marketing development funds, including for certain cooperative advertising, and price protection\nagreements. Vendor incentives are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as an offset to marketing and promotional\nexpenses to the extent that they represent reimbursement of advertising costs incurred by the Company on behalf of the vendors that are\nspecific, incremental, and identifiable. Reimbursements that are in excess of such costs and all other vendor incentive programs are\naccounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, or if the related product inventory is still on hand at the reporting date, inventory is reduced in\nthe consolidated balance sheets.\nF-13\nThe Company reduced cost of sales by $215.2 million, $224.3 million and $140.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively, for these vendor incentive programs. Reductions to advertising and promotional expenses related to direct\nreimbursements for costs incurred in advertising vendors’ products totaled $0.8 million, $1.3 million and $1.5 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amounts receivable related to vendor incentive programs were $57.1 million and $63.6\nmillion, net of allowances of $0.7 million and $0.6 million, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amounts due to the Company\nare included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets.\ns. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses primarily consist of marketing and advertising expenses, sales commissions, credit card\nprocessing fees, payroll and related benefits, depreciation and amortization, professional fees, litigation costs, rent expense, information\ntechnology expenses, warehouse costs, office expenses, and other general corporate costs.\nThe Company recognizes the cost of legal services related to defending litigation when the services are provided.\nt. Advertising\nAdvertising and promotional expenses are charged to operations when incurred and are included in selling, general, and administrative\nexpenses. Advertising and promotional expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $12.7 million, $14.7 million\nand $32.8 million, respectively.\nu. Stock-Based Compensation\nThe measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors,\nincluding employee stock options and restricted stock, is based on estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The value of\nawards that are ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. See Note 14 — Stock-Based Compensation for further\ninformation about the Company’s stock compensation plans.\nv. Income Taxes\nThe Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions. In accordance with ASC\nTopic 740, the Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred\ntaxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax\nrates expected to be in effect during the years in which the bases differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established\nagainst deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the recognized\ntax benefit as the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with a\ntaxing authority. The Company reverses a previously recognized tax benefit if it determines that the tax position no longer meets the more-\nlikely-than-not threshold of being sustained. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax\nexpense.\nw. Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Vendors\nThe Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The\nCompany has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk from cash and\ncash equivalents.\nF-14\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no individual customers that accounted for greater than 10% of\nnet sales.\nThe Company purchases its products on credit terms from vendors located primarily in the United States. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s cumulative annual purchases from two vendors, four vendors and three vendors,\nrespectively, exceeded 10% of total purchases. The majority of products that the Company sells are available through multiple channels.\nThe Company has receivables due from vendors related to its advertising and promotional vendor incentive programs and receivables due\nfrom business customers with credit terms. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, receivables from two vendors exceeded 10% of net\nreceivables. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no receivables from business customers with credit terms exceeded 10% of net\nreceivables.\nx. Foreign Currency Translation\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates where the local currency is the functional currency are translated into\nU.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the year for\nrevenues and expenses. Any gain or loss on currency translation is included in stockholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive\nincome.\ny. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation\nof the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, as amended and supplemented by subsequent ASUs (collectively, “ASU\n2020-04” and “ASU 2022-06”), which provides practical expedients for contract modifications and certain hedging relationships\nassociated with the transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. This guidance is applicable for borrowing\ninstruments, which use LIBOR as a reference rate, and is available through December 31, 2024. During the second quarter of 2023, the\nCompany amended certain terms of our credit agreement with several financial institutions and the related interest rate swap to replace the\nLIBOR with the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as part of our planned reference rate reform activities, as discussed in\nNote 8 – Line of Credit. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient which allows us to account for the modification of the\namended agreements as if the modifications were not substantial. These amendments did not have a material impact to our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures. Among other new disclosure requirements, ASU 2023-07 requires companies to disclose significant\nsegment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. All disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 are\nalso required for public entities with a single reportable segment. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. ASU 2023-07 must be applied\nretrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the disclosure impact of ASU\n2023-07.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09\nrequires companies to disclose, on an annual basis, specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and provide additional\ninformation for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, ASU 2023-09 requires companies to disclose additional\ninformation about income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and will be\napplied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the disclosure impact of\nASU 2023-09; however, the standard will not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations\nand/or cash flows.\nF-15\n4. Fair Value\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, and\nrestricted cash. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate their fair value.\nThe Company’s financial assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when impairment is identified include equity method\ninvestment and investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair value not accounted for under the equity method. The fair\nvalues of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market\nprices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds\nits fair value. This is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. See Note 6 — Investment for further information regarding the fair value\nmeasurement of these investments.\nThe Company’s notes receivable from affiliate, loans from affiliate (see Note 18 — Related Party Transactions), line of credit and long-term\ndebt are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required. The fair value of the amounts outstanding under the line of credit and long-term\ndebt with a floating interest rate approximates the carrying value primarily due to the variable nature of the interest rate of the instruments,\nwhich is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of the amounts outstanding under notes receivable from affiliate, loans\nfrom affiliate, and line of credit with a fixed interest rate is estimated based on the discounted amount of the contractual future cash flows using\nan appropriate discount rate. This is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement.\nThe Company’s warrants are measured at fair value on a recurring basis which is considered as a Level 3 fair value measurement (see Note 13 -\nWarrants).\nThe following is a summary of the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2022\nCarrying Estimated Carrying Estimated\nValue Fair Value Value Fair Value\nNotes receivable from affiliate (Level 3) $ 15,000 $ 15,000 $ 15,000 $ 15,000\nLine of credit (Level 2) $ 4,802 $ 4,802 $ 4,898 $ 4,898\nLine of credit (Level 3) $ 2,528 $ 2,435 $ 1,158 $ 1,114\nLong-term debt (Level 2) $ 1,378 $ 1,334 $ 1,673 $ 1,624\nWarrants liabilities (Level 3) $ 17 $ 17 $ 28 $ 28\n5.

The property would be transferred to its respective account within\nproperty and equipment upon completion.\nDepreciation and amortization expense associated with property and equipment was $13.0 million, $11.0 million and $10.8 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nF-16\n6. Investment\nOn April 17, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire an equity interest in Mountain Capital Fund L.P. (“Mountain”) from\nPegasus View Global Ltd., an international business company incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles (“Pegasus”), which is a related party.\nMountain is an exempted limited partnership registered under the partnership law in the Cayman Islands and primarily engages in investing.\nThe Company’s equity interest in Mountain was limited to 50% of Mountain’s investment in One97 Communications Limited and PayTM E-\nCommerce Private Limited (collectively, the “Mountain Investment”). In addition to the $43.0 million initial investment made during 2018, the\npurchase price in this transaction included a contingent consideration of up to $7.0 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions described in\nthe purchase agreement. This contingent consideration of $7.0 million was paid in April 2019. The Company evaluated the Mountain\nInvestment under the variable interest model and the voting interest model and concluded that Mountain Capital Fund L.P. is not a variable\ninterest entity and no consolidation is needed under either the variable interest model or the voting interest model. The Company recorded an\nestimate of contingent consideration payable of $7.0 million as of the acquisition date. The Company accounted for the Mountain Investment\nunder the equity method. During the year 2019, Mountain sold a portion of its investment in One97 Communications Limited (“One97”) to\nvarious third-party buyers, which resulted in the Company’s disposal of all of its investment in One97.\nIn December 2022, the Company was informed that Mountain intends to sell 100% of its shares in PayTM E-Commerce Private Limited to an\nunrelated third party and effectively dissolve Mountain, in exchange for approximately $0.7 million. Mountain and the unrelated third-party\nbuyer entered into a share purchase agreement on December 29, 2022. The Company reached a mutual understanding with Mountain that the\nCompany does not expect to receive any proceeds as part of the final sale and dissolution of Mountain as of December 31, 2022. The Company\nthen reviewed the investment in Mountain and determined an impairment existed as of December 31, 2022 and wrote off the full remaining\nbalance of $2.3 million in the statement of operations. Mountain was fully dissolved in 2023.\nIn August 2018, the Company purchased 11,506,695 Series B+ Preferred shares in Bitmain Technologies Holding Company, a privately-held\ncompany incorporated in the Cayman Islands, for a total consideration of $15.0 million. Bitmain Technologies Holding Company and its\nsubsidiaries (together “Bitmain”) primarily design and sell cryptocurrency mining hardware, operate cryptocurrency mining pools, and provide\nmining farm services. As this represents an investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, the Company elected the\nmeasurement alternative under ASU 2016-01 to measure this investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from\nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nIn 2023 and 2022, Bitmain repurchased a total of 26,758,080 and 11,149,200, respectively, Series B+ shares of Bitmain held by the Company’s\nsubsidiary, Newegg Tech Corporation at various prices in accordance with Bitmain’s articles of association. The Company reviewed the\ntransactions and concluded that the transactions are not an orderly transactions, and the Company would continue to account for the investment\nin Bitmain at cost. In addition, Newegg Tech Corporation also sold all 382,782 shares of its investment in Bitdeer Technologies Holding\nCompany, a spinoff company of Bitmain, in 2023. As a result, the Company recognized a total gain on sale of investment of $6.8 million and\n$1.7 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company reviewed the investment in Bitmain for impairment as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, by evaluating if events or\ncircumstances have occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The Company concluded there were\nno impairment indicators as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. In the absence of observable price changes in orderly transactions for the\nidentical or a similar investment of the same issuer during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of the investment\nremained at $2.3 million and $11.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThere was no impairment loss on Bitmain cost method investment for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nF-17\n7. Accrued Liabilities\nAccrued liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nSales and other taxes payable $ 13,840 17,250\nAccrued personnel 11,931 13,474\nAllowance for sales returns 5,839 8,664\nAccrued freight expense 1,704 2,522\nAccrued advertising expense 1,447 2,513\nAccrued legal expense 484 1,996\nAccrued inventory 2,338 1,374\nAccrued professional expense 2,552 752\nAccrued health expense 767 415\nOther 2,112 2,043\nTotal accrued liabilities $ 43,014 $ 51,003\n8. Line of Credit\nIn July 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement with several financial institutions that provided a revolving credit facility of up to\n$100.0 million with a maturity date of July 27, 2021. Prior to July 27, 2020 and subject to certain terms and conditions, the Maximum\nRevolving Advance Amount, as defined in the loan agreement, could be increased up to $140.0 million. The revolving credit facility included a\nletter of credit sublimit of $25.0 million, which could be used to issue standby and trade letters of credit, and a $10.0 million sublimit for\nswingline loans. Advances from this line of credit were subject to interest at LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin, as defined in the loan\nagreement, or the Alternate Base Rate (defined as the highest of the financial institution’s prime rate, the Overnight Bank Funding Rate plus\n0.50%, or the daily LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus the Applicable Margin. For LIBOR loans, the Company could select interest periods of one, two, or\nthree months. Interest on LIBOR loans were payable at the end of the selected interest period. Interest on Alternate Base Rate loans was\npayable monthly. The line of credit was guaranteed by certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries and was collateralized by certain of the assets\nof the Company. Such assets included all receivables, equipment and fixtures, general intangibles, inventory, subsidiary stock, securities,\nproperty, and financial assets, contract rights, and ledger sheets, as defined in the loan agreement. To maintain availability of funds under the\nloan agreement, the Company paid on a quarterly basis, an unused commitment fee of either 0.25% of the difference between the amount\navailable and the amount outstanding under the facility if the difference was less than one-third of the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount\nor 0.40% of the difference between the amount available and the amount outstanding under the facility if the difference was equal to or greater\nthan one-third of the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount.\nThe credit facility contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company’s ability to incur capital expenditures\nand lease payments, make certain investment, enter into certain related-party transactions, and pay dividends. That credit facility also requires\nthe Company to maintain certain minimum financial ratios and maintain an operational banking relationship with the financial institutions.\nF-18\nThe Company entered into a credit agreement in August 2021 with several financing institutions that provided a revolving credit facility of up\nto $100 million with a maturity date of August 20, 2024. Prior to August 20, 2023 and subject to certain terms and conditions, the Maximum\nRevolving Advance Amount, as defined in the credit agreement, could be increased up to $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes\na letter of credit sublimit of $30.0 million, which can be used to issue standby and trade letters of credit, and a $20.0 million sublimit for\nswingline loans. In April 2023, the Company amended the credit agreement in order to transition the benchmark rate for certain loans made\nunder the credit agreement from LIBOR to SOFR (as defined in the credit agreement). In general, advances from this line of credit will be\nsubject to interest at the Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin, as defined in the credit agreement, so long as the Term SOFR Reference\nRate or Term SOFR is offered, ascertainable, and not unlawful, or the Alternate Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of the (a) the Base Rate\nin effect on such day, (b) the sum of the Overnight Bank Funding Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50%, or (c) the daily Term SOFR Rate plus\n1.0%) plus the Applicable Margin. For Term SOFR Rate loans, we may select interest periods of one or three months. Interest on Term SOFR\nRate loans shall be payable at the end of the selected interest period. Interest on Alternate Base Rate loans is payable monthly. In the event of\nthe permanent or indefinite cessation of the Term SOFR Rate, the Benchmark Replacement will replace the Term SOFR Rate. If the Benchmark\nReplacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.\nThe line of credit is secured by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries and is collateralized by certain of the of the assets of the Company. Such\nassets include all receivables, equipment and fixtures, general intangibles, inventory, subsidiary stock, securities, property, and financial assets,\ncontract rights, and ledger sheets, as defined in the credit agreement. To maintain availability of funds under the credit agreement, the Company\nwill pay on a quarterly basis, an unused commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on the unused amount for the facility. The new credit facility\ncontains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company’s ability to incur capital expenditures and lease payments,\nmake certain investments, and enter into certain related-party transactions. The credit facility also requires the Company to maintain certain\nminimum financial ratios and maintain an operational banking relationship with the financial institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no balance outstanding under this line of credit, and the Company was in compliance with all\ncovenants related to the line of credit. As of December 31, 2023, Newegg has outstanding letters of credit of $2.0 million from the $100 million\nrevolving line of credit.\nIn July 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution that provided for a revolving credit facility of up to $5.0\nmillion (150.0 million New Taiwan Dollar) with a maturity date of no later than August 26, 2016. The Company extended the maturity date of\nthis credit agreement to December 15, 2024. Advances from this line of credit are subject to interest at a floating interest rate of the one-year\nsavings account plus 0.78% not to be lower than 1.62% per annum. The interest rate was equivalent to 2.37% as of December 31, 2023. The\nline of credit is guaranteed by one of the Company’s subsidiaries and is collateralized by a real estate asset of that subsidiary. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $4.8 million and $4.9 million outstanding under this line of credit, respectively.\nIn June 2021, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution that provided for a revolving credit\nfacility of up to $0.8 million (5.0 million Chinese Yuan) with a maturity date of June 15, 2022. Advances from this line of credit are subject to\ninterest at a fixed interest rate of one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) plus 0.50%. In June 2022, the Company paid off the outstanding balance\nunder this line of credit and entered into a new credit agreement with the same financial institution that provided for a revolving credit facility\nof up to approximately $1.2 million (RMB 8.0 million) with a maturity date of June 22, 2023. Advances from this line of credit are subject to\ninterest at a fixed rate of one-year LPR plus 0.30%. In June 2023, the Company paid off the outstanding balance under this line of credit and\nentered into two new credit agreements with the same financial institution that provided for a revolving credit facility of up to approximately\n$1.1 million (RMB 8.0 million) and $1.4 million (RMB 10.0 million) with a maturity date of June 26, 2024, and May 24, 2024, respectively.\nAdvances from these lines of credit are subject to interest at a fixed rate of one-year LPR plus 0.25% and 0.15%, respectively. The interest rate\nwas equivalent to 3.8% and 4.0% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $2.5 million\nand $1.2 million outstanding under this line of credit, respectively.\nF-19\n9. Long-Term Debt\nThe Company has entered into various loans with financial institutions. Long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nTerm Loan $ 1,378 $ 1,673\nLess current portion (268) (269)\nLong-term debt less current portion $ 1,110 $ 1,404\nTerm Loan\nIn 2013, the Company entered into a term loan agreement with a financial institution for $4.1 million with a maturity date of November 26,\n2028 (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan bears a floating interest rate of the one-year savings account plus 0.43% per annum in the first\ntwo years and a floating interest rate of the one-year savings account plus 0.61% per annum for the remaining of the term, not to be lower than\n1.8% during the entire term. The interest rate was equivalent to 2.20% as of December 31, 2023. The Term Loan is collateralized by a first\nposition security interest in a floor of an office building owned by the Company in Taiwan.\nAggregate maturities of long-term debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, were as follows (in thousands) as of December 31, 2023:\n2024 $ 268\n2025 274\n2026 280\n2027 287\n2028 269\n$ 1,378\n10. Lease Obligations\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases certain office and warehouse facilities and warehouse equipment under various noncancelable operating leases. The\nCompany is also committed under the terms of certain of these operating lease agreements to pay property taxes, insurance, utilities, and\nmaintenance costs.\nMost of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate that can be readily determined. Therefore, the Company uses a discount rate\nbased on its incremental borrowing rate, which is determined using its credit rating and information available as of the commencement date.\nThe Company’s operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term. The Company made an accounting policy election to\nexclude options that are not reasonably certain of exercise when determining the term of the borrowing in the assessment of the incremental\nborrowing rate. Additionally, the Company also made an accounting policy election to not separate lease and non-lease components of a\ncontract, and to recognize the lease payments under short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term without\nrecognizing the lease liability and the right of use (“ROU”) lease asset.\nThe Company evaluates whether its contractual arrangements contain leases at the inception of such arrangements. Specifically, the Company\nconsiders whether it can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the\nassets. Substantially all of its leases are long-term operating leases with fixed payment terms. The Company does not have significant financing\nleases. Its ROU operating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and its operating lease liabilities\nrepresent the obligation to make lease payments. ROU operating lease assets are recorded in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance\nsheet. Operating lease liabilities are recorded in other current liabilities or other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based\non their contractual due dates.\nThe Company’s operating lease liability is recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the\nlease term. The Company’s ROU operating lease asset is recognized as of the lease commencement date at the amount of the corresponding\nlease liability, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. The Company evaluates its ROU\nlease assets for impairment consistent with its impairment of long-lived assets policy. See Note 3 — Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.\nF-20\nOperating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and is included in selling, general, and administrative\nexpenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Operating lease expense totaled $21.9 million, $25.3 million and $20.1 million,\nrespectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The Company has made an accounting policy election by underlying\nasset class to not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases. As a result, certain leases with a term of 12 months or\nless are not recorded on the balance sheet and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Cash payments made for\noperating leases totaled $18.8 million, $22.0 million, and $17.7 million during years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively,\nwhich were included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe Company’s ROU operating lease assets were $77.2 million and $84.2 million, and its operating lease liabilities were $81.9 million and\n$89.1 million, of which $68.1 million and $74.8 million were classified as non-current, respectively. New ROU operating lease assets and\nliabilities entered into during 2023 were $18.9 million and $18.9 million, respectively. New or modified ROU operating lease assets and\nliabilities entered into during 2022 were $7.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The Company’s weighted average remaining lease term\nand the discount rate for its operating leases were approximately 6.36 years and 4.0% at December 31, 2023. The Company’s weighted average\nremaining lease term and the discount rate for its operating leases were approximately 5.99 years and 3.8% at December 31, 2022.\nThe Company has certain sublease arrangements for some of the leased office and warehouse facilities. Sublease rental income for the year\nended December 31, 2023 was $0.5 million. Sublease rental income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was immaterial.\nThe following table summarizes the future minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating lease arrangements in effect at\nDecember 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n2024 $ 16,884\n2025 17,223\n2026 14,932\n2027 14,497\n2028 13,393\nThereafter 16,894\nTotal minimum payments $ 93,823\nLess: Imputed interest 11,967\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 81,856\n11.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) amended Internal Revenue Code\nSection 174, effective for amounts paid or incurred for research and experimentation expenses in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021.\nPrior to this change taxpayers could elect to expense these costs in the year incurred or amortize these them over 5 years. Under the law as\namended research and experimental expenses are capitalized and amortized over five years (15 years for expenditures attributable to foreign\nresearch). As such, The Company capitalized its Section 174 costs for fiscal year 2023 and 2022 in the amount of $3.1 million and $2.6 million,\nnet of current year amortization. The Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccounts receivable $ 2,473 5,123\nInventories 2,139 2,807\nProperty and equipment 2,207 296\nReserves and other accruals 64 389\nStock based compensation 1,942 2,673\nLease liabilities 18,684 20,668\nSection 174 Costs 3,138 2,601\nCredits and other 2,834 1,669\nNet operating losses 13,191 9,921\nGross deferred tax assets 46,672 46,147\nValuation allowance (25,670) (24,128)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net 21,002 22,019\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nPrepaid expenses (1,606) (864)\nOther (233) (773)\nRight of Use of Asset (17,556) (19,514)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (19,395) (21,151)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 1,607 $ 868\nIn accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates whether a valuation allowance should be established against the net\ndeferred tax assets based upon the consideration of all available evidence and using a “more-likely than-not” standard. Significant weight is\ngiven to evidence that can be objectively verified. The determination to record a valuation allowance is based on the recent history of\ncumulative losses and losses expected in the near future.\nThe Company’s U.S. federal consolidated filing group includes certain international entities. Based upon results of operations for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit from the\nU.S. federal net deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets for the year\nended December 31, 2023 for its U.S. operations. The Company maintains valuation allowances against certain non-US loss corporations. Total\nvaluation allowance against U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets was $25.0 million and $24.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nF-22\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company has net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforward of $34.6 million and $45.8 million of apportioned state\nNOL carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, subject to the 80% NOL rule introduced by the TCJA of 2017. The state NOL\ncarryforwards begin to expire in 2028. The Company has $2.2 million of NOL carryforwards in China as of December 31, 2023. The Company\nhas $9.5 million of NOL carryforwards in Taiwan, which will begin to expire in 2026. The Company has $2.3 million NOLs in Hong Kong\nwith indefinite carryforward. A valuation allowance was recorded on the NOLs in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The Company has not\nprovided for deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts are considered indefinitely reinvested\noutside the United States. It is not practicable to determine the estimated income tax liability that might apply if these earnings were to be\nrepatriated.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nFederal taxes at statutory rate 21.00% 21.00% 21.00%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 2.50 2.48 (6.85)\nPermanent items:\nOther nondeductible items (0.35) (0.30) 0.48\nSubpart F income (1.55) (0.80) —\nStock-based compensation (10.94) (10.88) 0.74\nForeign withholding tax (0.82) — —\nResearch & development credit 0.34 1.57 —\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income (0.46) — —\nForeign rate differential and foreign tax credits (1.39) (0.74) 2.15\nCanada Provision 1.92\nChange in valuation allowance – U.S. Federal (5.61) (34.09) (33.11)\nChange in valuation allowance – U.S. States (0.07) (11.17) —\nChange in valuation allowance – Foreign 3.18 0.96 —\nChange in uncertainty tax position (“FIN48”) (2.54) (0.10) —\nOther (0.86) (0.01) (3.43)\nEffective tax rate 4.35% (32.08)% (19.02)%\nThe significant items that caused the effective tax rate change related to the changes in valuation allowance, uncertainty tax position, and\nCanada provision.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2023, the total liability for income tax associated with unrecognized tax benefits was $4.2 million. The Company’s\neffective tax rate will be affected by any portion of this liability we may recognize. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that\nany of the uncertain tax benefits will be recognized in the next 12 months. As such, all uncertain tax positions, including accrued interest, have\nbeen classified as long-term taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheets.\nF-23\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of uncertain tax positions is as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 1,606 $ 1,563\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the prior year 2,592 43\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 126 —\nReduction based on tax position related to settlements with taxing authorities (62) —\nReductions based on tax position related to a lapse of the applicable statute of limitation (20) —\nEnding balance $ 4,242 $ 1,606\nThe Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as tax expense. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were not material.\nThe Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, as well as combined and separate U.S. state income tax\nreturns. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to income tax in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Canada. The Company is still subject\nto examination for federal income tax returns for the years 2020 through 2022, for certain U.S. state income tax returns for the years 2016\nthrough 2022, and for certain foreign income tax returns for the years 2013 through 2022. In 2023, the Company settled the examinations with\nthe Internal Revenue Service for the years 2012 through 2014 and with the California Franchise Tax Board for the years 2007 through 2012. As\na result, reserve was reduced based on the current audit status.\n12. Common Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue unlimited shares of common stock with a par value of $0.021848. Each share of common stock is entitled\nto one vote. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding were 380,413,497 and\n376,660,069, respectively.\nNo common stock dividend was declared by the Company’s Board of Directors for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n13. Warrants\nOn April 28, 2016, LLIT signed a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Hangzhou Lianluo. In this SPA, Hangzhou Lianluo was entitled\nwith 125,000 warrants to acquire from the Company 125,000 common shares at a purchase price of $17.60 per share. The warrants are\nexercisable at any time. The Company recognized the warrants as a derivative liability because warrants can be settled in cash. Warrants are\nremeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in each reporting period.\nThere was a total of 125,000 warrants issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nThe fair value of the outstanding warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions:\nAs of As of\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nMarket price per share (USD/share) $ 1.26 $ 1.31\nExercise price (USD/share) 17.60 17.60\nRisk free rate 4.16% 4.18%\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nExpected term/Contractual life (years) 2.32 3.32\nExpected volatility 105.55% 96.90%\nF-24\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of warrants liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using\nLevel 3 inputs (in thousands):\nBeginning balance, January 1, 2022 $ 1,091\nFair value change of the issued warrants included in earnings (1,063)\nEnding balance, December 31, 2022 $ 28\nBeginning balance, January 1, 2023 $ 28\nFair value change of the issued warrants included in earnings (11)\nEnding balance, December 31, 2023 $ 17\n14. Stock-Based Compensation\nLegacy Newegg Inc. Stock Based Compensation\nNewegg Inc.’s stock-based compensation includes stock option awards issued under Newegg Inc.’s employee incentive plan, as further\ndiscussed below. There was no income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of income for stock-based compensation\narrangements in any of the periods presented.\nThe exercise prices of stock options and restricted stock granted were determined contemporaneously by the Newegg Inc.’s Board of Directors\nbased on the estimated fair value of the underlying Class A Common Stock and Series A convertible Preferred Stock. The Newegg Inc. Class A\nCommon Stock and Series A convertible Preferred Stock valuations were based on a combination of the income approach and two market\napproaches, which were used to estimate the total enterprise value of Newegg Inc. The income approach quantifies the present value of the\nfuture cash flows that management expects to achieve from continuing operations. These future cash flows are discounted to their present\nvalues using a rate corresponding to Newegg Inc.’s estimated weighted average cost of capital. Newegg Inc.’s weighted average cost of capital\nis calculated by weighting the required return on interest-bearing debt and common equity capital in proportion to their estimated percentages\nin Newegg Inc.’s capital structure. The market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on acquisition values or quoted trading\nprices of comparable public companies. An implied multiple of key financial metrics based on the trading and transaction values of publicly\ntraded peers is applied to Newegg Inc.’s similar metrics in order to derive an indication of value. A marketability discount is then applied to\nreflect the fact that Newegg Inc.’s Class A Common Stock and Series A convertible Preferred Stock are not traded on a public exchange. The\namount of the discount varies based on management’s expectation of effecting a public offering of Newegg Inc.’s Class A Common Stock\nwithin the ensuing 12 months. The enterprise value indications from the income approach and market approaches were used to estimate the fair\nvalue of Newegg Inc.’s Class A Common Stock and Series A convertible Preferred Stock in the context of Newegg Inc.’s capital structure as of\neach valuation date. Each valuation was based on certain estimates and assumptions. If different estimates and assumptions had been used,\nthese valuations could have been different.\nAt the close of the merger, the holders of Legacy Newegg Inc. stock options continue to hold such options, and such options remain subject to\nthe same vesting, exercise and other terms and conditions. The holders of Legacy Newegg Inc. options, as applicable, may exercise their\noptions to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Legacy Newegg Inc.\ncommon stock subject to such Legacy Newegg Inc. options multiplied by the conversion ratio at an exercise price per share divided by the\nconversion ratio.\n2005 Incentive Award Plan:\nOn September 22, 2005, the Board of Directors approved Newegg Inc.’s 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in January 2008,\nOctober 2009, December 2011 and September 2015 (the “Incentive Award Plan”). Under the Incentive Award Plan, the Company may\ngrant equity incentive awards to employees, directors, and consultants based on Newegg Inc.’s Class A Common Stock. A committee of the\nBoard of Directors of Newegg Inc. determines the eligibility, types of equity awards, vesting schedules, and exercise prices for equity\nawards granted. Subject to certain adjustments in the event of a change in capitalization or similar transaction, Newegg Inc. may issue a\nmaximum of 82,952,149 shares of its Class A Common Stock under the Incentive Award Plan. Newegg Inc. issues new shares of Class A\nCommon Stock from its authorized share pool to settle stock-based compensation awards. The exercise price of options granted under the\nplan shall not be less than the fair value of the Newegg Inc.’s Class A Common Stock as of the date of grant. Options typically vest over\nthe term of four years, and are typically exercisable for a period of 10 years after the date of grant, except when granted to a holder who, at\nthe time the option is granted, owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Newegg Inc. any\nsubsidiaries, in which case, the term of the option shall be no more than five years from the date of grant. In September 2015, the Incentive\nAward Plan was amended to permit additional awards to be made after the tenth anniversary of the original adoption of said plan.\nF-25\nThe fair value of each option award granted under the Incentive Award Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on\nthe date of grant. This model requires the input of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to,\nthe expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior\nwith the following inputs: risk-free interest rate, expected stock price volatility, forfeiture rate, expected term, dividend yield and weighted\naverage grant date fair value.\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the currently available rate on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the\nexpected term of the option converted into a continuously compounded rate. The expected volatility of stock options is based on a review\nof the historical volatility and the implied volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies comparable to the Company. In\nevaluating comparability, the Company considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, and size. After the adoption of Accounting\nStandards Update No. 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment\nAccounting as of January 1, 2017, the Company elected to recognize the effect of awards for which the requisite service is not rendered\nwhen the award is forfeited. The expected term assumption used by the Company reflects the application of the simplified method set out\nin Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, Shared-Based Payment. The simplified method defines the\nexpected term of an option as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option\ntranches. The dividend yield reflects the Company’s dividend rate on the date of grant. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, Newegg Inc. did not grant any stock options representing the right to purchase Newegg Inc. Common Stock.\nThe following table summarizes the activity for all stock options granted:\nAverage\nWeighted remaining Aggregate\naverage contractual intrinsic\nOptions exercise terms Value\noutstanding price (in years) (in thousands)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2021 67,036,826 $ 0.60 8.19 $ 51,754\nExercised (1,457,517)\nGrant —\nForfeited or expired (178,916) 0.73\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021 65,400,393 $ 0.60 7.30 $ 639,131\nExercised (6,305,365) 0.61\nGrant —\nForfeited or expired (59,635) 0.73\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 59,035,393 $ 0.60 6.46 $ 42,143\nExercised (2,178,788) 0.55\nGrant —\nForfeited or expired (434,128) 0.55\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 56,422,477 $ 0.60 5.42 $ 37,431\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023 56,422,477 $ 0.60 5.42 $ 37,431\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 48,178,834 $ 0.59 5.25 $ 32,194\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, stock options were exercised for 2,178,788 of the Company’s common stock.

The exercise prices ranged from $0.44 to $0.73 per share during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $1.7 million, $24.3 million,\nand $24.2 million, respectively, and the compensation expense for stock options granted included in “Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses” in the consolidated statements of operations totaled $3.1 million, $3.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were $1.4 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of unrecognized compensation costs related to\nnonvested options. The weighted average remaining vesting term of the stock option was 0.46 years, 1.46 years and 2.46 years as of\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNewegg Commerce, Inc. Stock Based Compensation\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nOn November 26, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the Company’s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). Under the 2021\nPlan, the Company may grant equity incentive awards to employees, directors, and consultants based on the Company’s Common Stock. A\ncommittee of the Board of Directors of the Company determines the eligibility, types of equity awards, vesting schedules, and exercise\nprices for equity awards granted. Subject to certain adjustments in the event of a change in control or similar transaction, the Company\nmay issue a maximum of 7,374,900 of its Common Stock under the 2021 Plan. The Company issues new shares of its Common Stock from\nits authorized share pool to settle stock-based compensation awards.\nOn July 21, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the amendment of the 2021 Plan to increase the maximum share pool from 7,374,900 to\n16,374,900 shares.\nThe following table summarizes the activity for all restricted stock units granted:\nWeighted-\naverage\ngrant date\nShares fair value\nUnvested at January 1, 2021 — $ —\nGranted 7,040,998 18.38\nVested — —\nCancelled — —\nUnvested at December 31, 2021 7,040,998 $ 18.38\nGranted 285,000 2.79\nVested (1,675,007) 18.38\nCancelled (1,022,720) 18.38\nUnvested at December 31, 2022 4,628,271 $ 17.42\nGranted 80,000 1.23\nVested (1,548,819) 17.53\nCancelled (164,988) 15.28\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 2,994,464 $ 17.05\nF-27\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted 80,000 and 285,000 restricted stock units (“RSUs”),\nrespectively, to its executives and employees. The vesting of each RSU is subject to the employee’s continued employment through\napplicable vesting dates. The RSUs are accounted for as equity awards and are measured at fair value based upon the grant date price of\nthe Company’s common stock. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of four years.\nOn August 13, 2022 the Company issued 5,560,780 performance-based vesting restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) to one of its executives\nover four performance periods where 1,386,445 PRSUs were granted for each of the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Each of the\nfour performance periods will have a separate grant date and service inception date, and a separate requisite service period. The PRSUs are\naccounted for as equity awards and are measured at fair value based upon the grant date price of the Company’s common stock. The\nvesting of each PRSU is based on financial performance tied to GMV. The vesting of PRSUs is determined at the end of each of the four-\nyear performance periods. The payout can vary from zero to 100% based on actual results and performance goals may be adjusted by the\nCompensation Committee from time to time in its sole discretion.\nThe following table summarizes the activity for all performance-based restricted stock units granted:\nWeighted-\naverage\ngrant date\nShares fair value\nUnvested at January 1, 2022 — $ —\nGranted 1,386,445 3.88\nVested — —\nCancelled — —\nUnvested at December 31, 2022 1,386,445 $ 3.88\nGranted 1,386,445 1.17\nVested (1,386,445) 3.88\nCancelled — —\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 1,386,445 $ 1.17\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the compensation expense for all restricted stock units granted included in\n“Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations totaled $30.5 million, $30.8 million and $3.1\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were $51.3 million and $82.9 million, respectively, of unrecognized compensation costs related\nto restricted stock units.\n15. Net Income (Loss) per Share\nBasic earnings per share of Common Stock is calculated by dividing net income available to holders of Common stock by the weighted average\nnumber of shares of Common Stock outstanding for the period. The diluted earnings per share of Common Stock calculation assumes the\nissuance of all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential Common Stock consists of incremental shares of Class A\nCommon Stock issuable upon the exercise of the stock options.\nF-28\nThe following table summarizes the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share (in thousands, except per share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income (loss) $ (58,990) $ (57,429) $ 36,262\nBasic earnings per share\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 378,557 373,067 366,651\nBasic earnings (loss) per share $ (0.16) $ (0.15) $ 0.10\nDiluted earnings per share\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 378,557 373,067 366,651\nDilutive effect of stock options — — 65,599\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 378,557 373,067 432,250\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.16) $ (0.15) $ 0.08\nThe following shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive\n(in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nStock options 25,972 51,845 54\nRestricted stock units 5,971 7,084 7,041\nWarrants 125 125 125\n16. Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is a party to various lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company discloses contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrues loss contingencies when, in consultation with legal\nadvisors, it is concluded that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn December 2014, an individual plaintiff sued our subsidiary, Newegg.com Americas Inc. (“Newegg.com Americas”), in Superior Court in Los\nAngeles County, California, alleging that Newegg.com Americas had engaged in deceptive advertising practices and seeking to certify a class\naction. In 2016, the trial court sustained Newegg.com Americas’ demurrer to the plaintiff’s claims without leave to amend. The plaintiff\nappealed, and in July 2018 an appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court, thus allowing the case to proceed. On September 18, 2023,\nthe trial court granted our motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.\nIn September 2021, two subsidiaries of the Company were served with a complaint filed in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County,\nCalifornia, alleging various wage and hour violations and seeking to certify a class action. In October 2021, a second complaint was filed as a\nrepresentative action pursuant to the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 against the same two subsidiaries in the Superior Court for Los\nAngeles County, California, alleging various violations of the California Labor Code. The Company intends to vigorously defend its\nsubsidiaries in both matters. The outcome of these matters is uncertain. Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable result in either\nmatter could materially affect our business, consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIn addition to the legal proceedings mentioned above, from time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the\nordinary course of business. There can be no assurance with respect to the outcome of any legal proceeding. The outcome of the litigation\ndescribed above, the other pending lawsuits filed against the Company and other claims, including those that may be made in the future, may\nbe adverse to the Company, and the monetary liability and other negative operational or financial impact may be material to the Company’s\nconsolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nF-29\n17. Employee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) defined-contribution plan for the benefit of its eligible employees. All full-time domestic employees who are\nat least 18 years of age are eligible to participate in the plan. Eligible employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their eligible\ncompensation. The Company’s matching contributions are made at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. In addition, the\nCompany may make a profit-sharing contribution at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. Total contributions by the Company for each\nof the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $1.9 million, $1.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Contributions made by\nthe Company are immediately 100% vested.\n18. Related Party Transactions\nLoans to Affiliate\nOn December 17, 2019, the Company loaned $15.0 million to Digital Grid under a term loan agreement with a maturity date of April 30, 2020\nand a fixed interest rate of 5.0% (the “$15.0 Million Loan”). The $15.0 Million Loan was subsequently extended to June 30, 2024. The $15.0\nMillion Loan is included as “Notes receivable” at the Stockholders’ Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded interest income of $0.8 million, $0.8 million and $0.8\nmillion, respectively, from loans to affiliate in interest income in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe amount of interest receivable on the $15.0 Million Loan outstanding included as a component of “Notes receivable” at the Stockholders’\nEquity section in the consolidated balance sheets was $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nSales to Related Parties\nDue from related parties and net sales to related parties primarily reflect sales of finished goods and services with the exception of loans to\naffiliate as discussed above. Sales during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were immaterial.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, amount due to related parties was immaterial.\n19.

Total revenue of $480.6 million beat our estimate of $439.2 million by 9%, and adj. EBITDA of $5.1 million was\nsignificantly better than our forecast of $0.1 million, illustrated in Figure #1 Q4 Results. The strong results were driven by the\nDirect Sales segment, which beat our revenue outlook by 11% in the quarter and made up the largest component of total\ncompany revenues. Additionally, SG&A expenses were 10% below our forecast, resulting in better-than-expected cash flow.\nAlthough 2022 ended with encouraging results, we are still cautious about the operating environment the company will contend\nwith in 2023.\nThe economic difficulties of 2022 appear to be persisting so far in 2023, be putting pressure on the consumer electronics\nmarket. As such, management is taking a cautious view of 2023, which could face similar challenges to the prior year. In\nparticular, the company’s Marketplace and Services segments face headwinds. Of late, the Marketplace business has had\ntrouble onboarding new vendors, due to compliance issues. As for Services, the poor economy is negatively impacting demand\nfor the company’s services, such as the company’s staffing business.\nYet despite the uncertainty surrounding the economy, there are reasons for optimism. Notably, the company has initiated cost-\ncutting measures with the aim of offsetting some of the negative impacts on cash flow from potentially lower-than-anticipated\nMarketplace and Services revenue, which has very high margins. Moreover, there could be upside for the company’s Direct\nSales segment, due to oversupply of products. Importantly, the oversupply is on the part of the company’s suppliers, it is not an\noversupply of Newegg’s owned inventory. As a result, it is Newegg’s suppliers that will potentially be obliged to sponsor\ndiscounts, in order to move inventory via Newegg’s platform. This could bolster sales, without sacrificing margins.\nWe are taking a more cautious view of the economy and lowering our revenue and adj. EBITDA forecast for 2023 and tweaking\ndown our 2024 forecast to reflect a modest growth rate. For 2023, we are largely maintaining our revenue forecast at $1.518\nbillion but lowering our adj. EBITDA forecast from $3.9 million to a loss of $1.0 million, illustrated in Figure #2 Forecast\nRevisions. For the first half of 2023, which is the company’s next reporting period, we are lowering our adj. EBITDA forecast\nfrom a loss of $3.6 million to a loss of $4.5 million. By Q4, we expect the company to generate positive adj. EBITDA, as the\ncompany’s cost cutting measure take greater effect. Our 2023 revisions largely reflect a change in our forecasted revenue mix.\nWe are slightly raising our Direct Sales revenue forecast and lowering our Marketplace and Services revenue forecasts.\nNotably, Marketplace revenue is reported on a net basis. As such, although it accounts for a small minority of total company\nrevenue, it has a significant impact on margins. In 2024, we anticipate revenue to grow at 2.5% to $1.556 billion and adj.\nEBITDA to be positive, at $3.9 million.\nAs of December 31, the company had $122.6 million in cash and $1.4 million in long-term debt. In our view, this gives the\ncompany the necessary financial flexibility to weather the current economic turbulence and challenging selling environment.\nAdditionally, the company could use its cash position to seek opportunistic acquisitions to enhance long-term revenue and cash\nflow growth.\nWe believe that the weakness in the NEGG shares reflect the current uncertain economic environment. The shares are down\nsignificantly from highs of $4.50 in August 2022 to near current levels. In our view, the stock valuation appears compelling for\ninvestors willing to await for a turn in economic prospects and improved fundamentals. Near current levels, the NEGG shares\ntrade at 0.2 times enterprise value to our 2024 revenue forecast, below peers, which trade at an average of 0.8 times. The peer\ngroup is illustrated in Figure #3 e-Commerce Comparables.\nWe are lowering our price target from $3.5 to $3, to reflect our lowered cash flow outlook for the company. Despite our lowered\nprice target, we believe there is encouraging upside potential for the NEGG shares, which appear to be trading near\nrecessionary type valuations. Given the uncertain economic outlook, investors should consider taking an accumulation\napproach to the shares. Our price target reflects a target multiple of 0.8 times our 2024 adj. EBITDA forecast, more in line with\npeers. We believe there could be opportunities for additional multiple expansion should the company demonstrate the ability to\ngenerate consistent positive cash flow in an improved operating environment. Notably, we anticipate the company will be adj.\nEBITDA positive in 2024. WE believe that the shares offer a favorable risk/reward relationship and rate the shares Outperform.\nNewegg Commerce, Inc.

(NEGG) | Current Price: $1.04 | Outperform | May 02, 2023\nCompany Profile\nNewegg is an e-commerce company focused on electronics, such as PC components, gaming products, and other similar\nhardware. The company is headquartered in City of Industry, California and operates distribution facilities throughout the U.S.\nand Canada. Originally founded in 2001, Newegg has evolved over the past 20 years to become a highly ranked e-commerce\nplatform. During its first 10 years, the company founded its in-house electronics brand, Rosewill, and launched its business-to-\nbusiness (B2B) website. During this period, Newegg also founded its marketplace, which allows third-party vendors to reach\nconsumers. Over the next 10 years, throughout the 2010s, the company expanded its reach to 20+ countries, including China.\nDuring this period, the company unified its platform to include both direct sales and marketplace, while achieving global scale. It\noperates through three business segments, Direct Sales, Marketplace, and Services.\nFundamental Analysis - 3.5/5.0 Checks\nWe are initiating coverage with a fundamental score of 3.5. The ranking is based on several factors including Corporate\nGovernance/Management, Market Opportunity, Competitive Position, Operating Leverage, and Financial Leverage. The\ncompany scores high on Market Opportunity, given the large and growing addressable market estimated to reach $482 billion in\nNorth America by 2026. The company received lower marks on Operating Leverage given that its margins are lower than its\npeer group, estimated to be 0.3% in 2023 versus its peer group at 7% on an adj. EBITDA basis. The company stated that it\nplans to decrease costs to improve its cash flow margins and to right size its business. Further efforts in that direction could\nlead us to upwardly revise our fundamental analysis. The company also scored high on Financial Leverage, given that the\ncompany currently has $81 million in cash and virtually no long term debt.\nValuation Summary\nNear current levels, the NEGG shares trade at 0.2 times enterprise value to our 2024 revenue forecast, below peers, which\ntrade at an average of 0.8 times. Our enterprise value calculation uses 445 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We are\nlowering our price target from $3.5 to $3, to reflect our lowered cash flow outlook for the company. Our price target reflects a\ntarget multiple of 0.8 times our 2024 adj. EBITDA forecast, more in line with peers. We believe there could be opportunities for\nadditional multiple expansion should the company demonstrate the ability to generate consistent positive cash flow in the\nfuture. Notably, we anticipate the company will be adj. EBITDA positive in 2024. Success in achieving favorable adj. EBITDA\nmargins may allow a valuation methodology that focuses on adj. EBITDA.\nRisks in achieving our price target include: increased competition as more businesses move into the e-commerce vertical,\nsustained macroeconomic headwinds, such as inflation, and lower than expected consumer adoption of the company's\nexpanding product offerings.\nNewegg Commerce, Inc.

(NEGG) | Current Price: $1.04 | Outperform | May 02, 2023\nFUNDAMENTAL ASSESSMENT\nThe fundamental assessment rating system is designed to provide insights on the company's fundamentals both on a macro level, which incorporates a\ncompany's market opportunity and competitive position, and on a micro/company specific level. The micro/company specific attributes include operating &\nfinancial leverage, and corporate governance/management. The number of check marks that a company receives is designed to provide a quick reference and\neasy determination of the company's fundamentals based upon the following five attributes of the company (weighting reflects the importance of each attribute\nin the overall scoring of company’s fundamental analysis):\nAttribute Weighting\nCorporate Governance/Management 20%\nMarket Opportunity Analysis 20%\nCompetitive Position 20%\nOperating Leverage 20%\nFinancial Leverage 20%\nFor each attribute, the analysts score the company from a low of zero to a high of ten based upon the analysis described below. The final rating and resulting\ncheck marks is a result of dividing the overall score (out of 100%) by ten.\nRating Score Checks\nSuperior 9.1 to 10 Five Checks\nSuperior 8.1 to 9 Four & A Half Checks\nAbove Average 7.1 to 8 Four Checks\nAbove Average 6.1 to 7 Three & A Half Checks\nAverage 5.1 to 6 Three Checks\nAverage 4 to 5 Two & A Half Checks\nBelow Average 3 to 3.9 Two Checks\nBelow Average 2 to 2.9 One & A Half Checks\nLow Quality 0 to 1.9 One Check\nWhile these are the attributes currently used for the analyst's fundamental analysis, the attributes and weighting may be reviewed, updated with additional\nattributes, and/or changed in the future based on discussions with the analysts and recommendations from the Director of Research.\nFollowing is the description of each attribute in the fundamental analysis.\nCorporate Governance/Management\nWe believe that a review of corporate governance and assessment of the senior management are important tools to determine investment merit. Good\ncorporate governance aligns management with the interests of stakeholders. As such, analysts are to rank the company on the basis of good corporate\ngovernance principles that may include rules and procedures, board composition and staggered term limits, rights and responsibilities, corporate objectives,\nmonitoring of actions and policies, and accountability. In addition, analysts will assess issues with controlling shareholders and whether decisions have been\nmade in the past that were in the interests of all shareholders. In addition, management will be assessed based on industry experience, expertise, and/or track\nrecord.\nHigh ranking example: Board and management that is aligned with the interests of shareholders with incentives based on stock price appreciation and with an\nexperienced management team known for exceptional shareholder returns.\nLow ranking example: Concentrated ownership without independent directors that do not necessarily align with all shareholders' interests.\nThe Market Opportunity Analysis\nIn this review, the analyst assesses the company's macro environment as a measure of understanding the industry. Factors considered include the size and\ngrowth potential of the industry under various economic conditions, the emerging demands in the market, technological benefits/disruptions, competition,\ngeographical opportunities, and customer demands/needs, and an assessment of supply and distribution channels. In addition, the analyst will review legal and\nregulatory trends, as well as potential shifts in consumer or social behavior and natural environment changes.\nHigh rank example: A company in an industry that is growing revenues well above GDP rates (which are on average 2% plus) and/or may have unmet or under-\nserved needs in a rapidly growing market opportunity.\nLow rank example: A mature industry that is in secular decline and likely to grow below GDP rates.\nNewegg Commerce, Inc. (NEGG) | Current Price: $1.04 | Outperform | May 02, 2023\nCompetitive Position\nThe evaluation of the company's competitive position is another macro environment attribute designed to measure the relevance, market share, position and\nvalue proposition, and sustainable differentiations of the company and its products/services within its industry. Ease of entry into the industry and the ability of\nother well-funded players to potentially enter the market would be determined. As such, the assessment would consider the company's strengths and\nadvantages of its products/services against weaknesses and limitations. This may include the company's current brand awareness, pricing and cost structure,\ncurrent market strategies and geographic penetration that may affect demand for its products/services. In addition, the company's competitors would be\nevaluated.\nHigh rank example: An analyst would consider the company's product to be superior to its competitors and that should allow the company to gain market share.\nLow rank example: A company with a \"me-too\" product that does not have any significant technology advantages in an industry that has low barriers to entry.\nOperating Leverage\nSimplistically, operating leverage is determined by the operating income relative to changes in revenue. The analyst will calculate the impact on sensitivity on\ngross margins and variable costs to determine operating leverage. The analyst will take into account the ability of the company to cut fixed and variable costs in\na challenged revenue environment and technological changes that may impact operating expenses. In addition, the analyst is to assess corporate strategies\nthat include capital investment, which may be required for sustainable revenue growth, marketing expenses, and the company's ability to attract and retain\ntalent and/or employees. The analyst should focus on the revenue opportunity and determine the price elasticity of demand for the company's products or\nservices. In other words, the analyst is to rank the company based on improved operating margins going forward on an absolute and relative basis.\nHigh rank example: A company that has improving margins for the foreseeable future, with significant price elasticity.\nLow rank example: A company that is in a challenged revenue environment with a fixed cost structure and limited ability to cut costs, indicating an outlook for\ndeclining margins.\nFinancial Leverage\nA strict definition of financial leverage is total debt divided by total shareholder's equity. Financial leverage analysis is to determine the company's ability to\nimprove shareholder value by means of utilizing its balance sheet to grow organically or to acquire assets. Analysts may look at the company's debt to cash\nflow leverage ratio, interest coverage ratios, or debt to equity ratios. In addition, the interest rate environment and the outlook for interest rates are a factor in\ndetermining the company's ability to manage financial leverage. Finally, the analyst is expected to determine the ability to service the debt given the industry\nand/or company profile, such as cyclicality, barriers to entry, history of bankruptcy, consistency in revenue and profit growth, or predictability in sales and profits\nand large cash reserves. The analyst is expected to take into account capital intensity of the company and the anticipated of capital allocation decisions.\nHigh rank example: A company with predictable and growing revenue and cash flow with modest debt levels. This may indicate that the company could improve\nshareholder value through growth investments, including acquisitions, using debt financing.\nLow rank example: A company in a cyclical industry in a late stage economic cycle that has above average debt leverage and is in an industry that has a history\nof financial challenges, including bankruptcies.\nANALYST CREDENTIALS, PROFESSIONAL DESIGNATIONS, AND EXPERIENCE\nDirector of Research.
