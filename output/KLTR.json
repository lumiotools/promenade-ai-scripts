Based on each student’s preferences, engagement patterns, and past interactions, and drawing exclusively from their institution’s trusted knowledge base, Class Genie creates individualized immersive learning resources tailored for personal needs. \n\nThe Kaltura Class Genie is built to support individualized personalized learning, for both teachers and students. ‘One size fits all’ programs rarely meet students’ diverse needs. For educators, knowing and catering to each student’s needs is unscalable and virtually impossible, a problem that has long challenged teachers, students, and parents alike. Leveraging each institution’s curated knowledge base, the Class Genie customizes content for students and turns endless searching into instant discovery. Genie can create a range of hyper-personalized content, from video snippets, interactive flashcards, and quizzes, to podcasts, video modules, and knowledge tests. It exclusively draws from relevant video content and data from their institution, ensuring that the material reflects the needs of the students and teachers.\n\nBuilt with privacy in mind with fully customizable permissions and operating exclusively within the institution’s closed-circuit system, Class Genie is designed to guarantee responsible data management. No student data is shared or trained-upon for any other use case or environment. To avoid the risk of AI hallucinations (when AI generates a response containing false or misleading information that is presented as a fact) and incorrect and inadequate material being presented, Class Genie relies exclusively on the institution's trusted data sources, delivering a safe and reliable educational experience.\n\n\"Students have unique needs and learning styles which are catered to today in a very limited way in classroom experiences and by supportive class content. Kaltura’s Class Genie was developed to bridge this gap by generating in real-time hyper-personalized immersive content that is tailored for each student’s individual needs & learning styles. It’s like having a personal tutor that, both pro-actively and reactively, addresses all your needs and wants,” said Ron Yekutiel, Co-Founder, Chairman, President and CEO of Kaltura. “Kaltura is managing the video assets of many of the world’s leading universities, including more than 40% of US R1 schools. The vast majority of this content has quickly become stale and is never again viewed. Class Genie helps find and deliver in real-time relevant snippets from this immense content treasure trove to the right students at the right time, bringing the content back to life. This results in much more effective teaching and learning, and in significantly higher efficiency and ROI for educational organizations.”\n\nClass Genie debuted at Kaltura’s Connect in Education global roadshow across North America and Europe, which brought together education and digital learning professionals to explore, among other things, the latest innovations by Kaltura that improve student enrollment, engagement, and retention and boost learning outcomes. This year's event included representatives from dozens of institutions including Purdue University, Indiana University, University of Michigan, Penn State University, University of Minnesota, King's College London, University of Leiden, Warwick Business School, Amsterdam University of the Arts, and NORDUnet. Over half of the organizations that attended this year's events have already enrolled in the Kaltura Class Genie beta-release program, and are expected to begin integrating it into their organizations. \n\nTo learn more, or to sign up for the Kaltura Class Genie beta, see [here](https://corp.kaltura.com/landing_pages/genie/class-genie/ \"here\"). \n\n**About Kaltura**\n\nKaltura’s mission is to power any video experience for any organization.

(“Kaltura” or the “Company”), the video experience cloud, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, as well as outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2024.\n\n“We delivered record subscription revenue and ARR in the third quarter, making it our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Cash flow was at a record high, and Adjusted EBITDA was positive for the fifth consecutive quarter and at its highest level since the second quarter of 2020, fueled by a record gross margin. We also posted a sequential and year-over-year increase in new bookings for the second consecutive quarter, continued year-over-year improvement in gross retention, and record RPO. In light of these results, we are once again increasing our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year and are expecting to post positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which would translate to over a $46 million improvement in cash flow from operations in 2024 as compared to the same period only two years ago,” said Ron Yekutiel, Kaltura Co-founder, Chairman, President and CEO.\n\nMr. Yekutiel continued, “We believe that the tide is gradually turning on the industry and Kaltura, and that the improved booking and retention trend that we started seeing in recent quarters will continue and strengthen in 2025 and beyond, fueled by renewed industry and macroeconomic tailwinds as well as product enhancements harnessing Gen-AI that are expected to bring about further digital transformation and proliferation of video experiences. We expect that as the market gradually regrows, customers will further accelerate the consolidation of their video needs around Kaltura to boost all of their employee and customer experiences.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * **Revenue** for the third quarter of 2024 was $44.3 million, an increase of 2% compared to $43.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Subscription revenue** for the third quarter of 2024was $42.1 million, an increase of 3% compared to $40.8 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR)** for the third quarter of 2024 was$168.9 million, an increase of 4% compared to $163.1 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **GAAP** **Gross profit** for the third quarter of 2024 was $29.5 million, representing a gross margin of 67%, compared to a GAAP gross profit of $27.7 million and gross margin of 64% for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **Non-GAAP** **Gross profit** for the third quarter of 2024 was $29.9 million, representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 68%, compared to a non-GAAP gross profit of $28.1 million and non-GAAP gross margin of 65% for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **GAAP** **Operating loss** was $4.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of $8.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Non-GAAP** **Operating income** was $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $0.8 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **GAAP Net loss** was $3.6 million or $0.02 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a GAAP net loss of $10.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Non-GAAP Net income** was $2.1 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $3.2 million, or $(0.02) per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** was $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities** was $10.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Business Highlights:**\n\n  * Closed 2 seven-digit deals and 22 six-digit deals across a diverse array of industries, use-cases, and geographies.\n  * Highest new bookings since the fourth quarter of 2022.\n  * Improved gross retention year-over-year, and re-growth of Net Dollar Retention to 101% after posting 98% in the last three quarters.\n  * Started productizing our “Content Lab” where Gen-AI is used to analyze video captions and viewership engagement data to create in real-time new clips, highlight reels, and other immersive experiences that are hyper-personalized and hyper-contextualized. Also showcased a beta version of our Gen-AI offerings for Media and Telecom customers at the IBC 2024 conference in Amsterdam, including AI-generated metadata enrichment, subtitles, dubbing, chaptering, highlights, and content recommendation for live streaming, VOD assets, and user generated content.\n  * Won two additional significant industry awards: the “best overall event management solution award” in the 7th annual international Martech Breakthrough Awards Program, and “best video management platform award” in the 2024 Digiday Technology Awards.\n\n\n\n**Financial Outlook:**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Kaltura currently expects:\n\n  * **Subscription Revenue** to grow by 2%-4% year-over-year to between $41.8 million and $42.5 million.\n  * **Total Revenue** to grow (decline) by (1)% - 1% year-over-year to between $44.0 million and $44.7 million.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** to be in the range of $0.5 million to $1.5 million.\n\n\n\nFor the full year ending December 31, 2024, Kaltura currently expects:\n\n  * **Subscription Revenue** to grow by 2% year-over-year to between $166.1 million and $166.8 million.\n  * **Total Revenue** to grow by 1% - 2% year-over-year to between $177.1 million and $177.8 million.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** to be in the range of $5.1 million to $6.1 million.\n\n\n\nThe guidance provided above contains forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. Refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Kaltura has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net loss within this press release because the Company is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to calculate certain reconciling items with confidence. The reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA includes but is not limited to the following items: stock-based compensation expenses, depreciation, amortization, financial expenses (income), net, provision for income tax, and other non-recurring operating expenses. These items, which could materially affect the computation of forward-looking GAAP net loss, are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, some of which are outside of the Company’s control.\n\nAdditional information on Kaltura’s reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, is included in the financial tables below.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nKaltura will host a conference call today on November 6, 2024 to review its third quarter 2024 financial results and to discuss its financial outlook.\n\nTime:| 8:00 a.m. ET  \n---|---  \nUnited States/Canada Toll Free:| 1-877-407-0789  \nInternational Toll:| 1-201-689-8562  \n  \nA live webcast will also be available in the Investor Relations section of Kaltura’s website at: <https://investors.kaltura.com/news-and-events/events>. \n\nA replay of the webcast will be available in the Investor Relations section of the company’s web site approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call and remain available for approximately 30 calendar days.\n\n**About Kaltura**\n\nKaltura’s mission is to power any video experience for any organization.

All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding our future financial and operating performance, including our guidance; our business strategy, plans and objectives for future operations; and general economic, business and industry conditions, including expectations with respect to trends in our market and industry and the impact of Gen-AI adoption.\n\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “due,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “plan,” “predict,” “potential,” “positioned,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and future trends, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on our historical performance and our current plans, estimates and expectations and are not a representation that such plans, estimates, or expectations will be achieved. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations as of the date of this press release. Subsequent events may cause these expectations to change, and we disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements in the future, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.\n\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the current volatile economic climate and its direct and indirect impact on our business and operations; political, economic, and military conditions in Israel and other geographies; our ability to retain our customers and meet demand; our ability to achieve and maintain profitability; the evolution of the markets for our offerings; our ability to keep pace with technological and competitive developments; risks associated with our use of certain artificial intelligence and machine learning models; our ability to maintain the interoperability of our offerings across devices, operating systems and third-party applications; risks associated with our Application Programming Interfaces, other components in our offerings and other intellectual property; our ability to compete successfully against current and future competitors; our ability to increase customer revenue; risks related to our approach to revenue recognition; our potential exposure to cybersecurity threats; our compliance with data privacy and data protection laws; our ability to meet our contractual commitments; our reliance on third parties; our ability to retain our key personnel; risks related to our revenue mix and customer base; risks related to our international operations; risks related to potential acquisitions; our ability to generate or raise additional capital; and the other risks under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as such factors may be updated from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov) and the Investor Relations page of our website at investors.kaltura.com.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nKaltura has provided in this press release and the accompanying tables measures of financial information that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin (calculated as a percentage of revenue), non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin (calculated as a percentage of revenue), non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA. Kaltura defines these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective corresponding GAAP measure, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) facility exit and transition costs; (4) restructuring charges; and (5) war-related costs. Kaltura defines EBITDA as net profit (loss) before financial expenses (income), net, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (as defined above), adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance, such as non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, facility exit and transition costs, restructuring charges and other non-recurring operating expenses. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Kaltura’s financial condition and results of operations. These non-GAAP metrics are a supplemental measure of our performance, are not defined by or presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net profit (loss) or any other performance measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented because we believe that they provide useful supplemental information to investors and analysts regarding our operating performance and are frequently used by these parties in evaluating companies in our industry. By presenting these non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. Additionally, our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of our performance because they assist us in comparing the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis between periods, as described above. Although we use the non-GAAP financial measures described above, such measures have significant limitations as analytical tools and only supplement but do not replace, our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. See the tables below regarding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**Key Financial and Operating Metrics**\n\n_Annualized Recurring Revenue._ We use Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) as a measure of our revenue trend and an indicator of our future revenue opportunity from existing recurring customer contracts. We calculate ARR by annualizing our recurring revenue for the most recently completed fiscal quarter. Recurring revenues are generated from SaaS and PaaS subscriptions, as well as term licenses for software installed on the customer's premises (“On-Prem”). For the SaaS and PaaS components, we calculate ARR by annualizing the actual recurring revenue recognized for the latest fiscal quarter. For the On-Prem components for which revenue recognition is not ratable across the license term, we calculate ARR for each contract by dividing the total contract value (excluding professional services) as of the last day of the specified period by the number of days in the contract term and then multiplying by 365. Recurring revenue excludes revenue from one-time professional services and setup fees. ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future customer cancellations, upgrades or downgrades or price increases or decreases. The amount of actual revenue that we recognize over any 12-month period is likely to differ from ARR at the beginning of that period, sometimes significantly. This may occur due to new bookings, cancellations, upgrades or downgrades, pending renewals, professional services revenue, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions or divestitures. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as it is an operating metric and is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue. Our calculation of ARR may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies.\n\n_Net Dollar Retention Rate._ Our Net Dollar Retention Rate, which we use to measure our success in retaining and growing recurring revenue from our existing customers, compares our recognized recurring revenue from a set of customers across comparable periods. We calculate our Net Dollar Retention Rate for a given period as the recognized recurring revenue from the latest reported fiscal quarter from the set of customers whose revenue existed in the reported fiscal quarter from the prior year (the numerator), divided by recognized recurring revenue from such customers for the same fiscal quarter in the prior year (denominator). For annual periods, we report Net Dollar Retention Rate as the arithmetic average of the Net Dollar Retention Rate for all fiscal quarters included in the period. We consider subdivisions of the same legal entity (for example, divisions of a parent company or separate campuses that are part of the same state university system) ,as well as Value-add Resellers (“VARs”) (meaning resellers that directly manage the relationship with the customer) and the customers they manage, to be a single customer for purposes of calculating our Net Dollar Retention Rate. Our calculation of Net Dollar Retention Rate for any fiscal period includes the positive recognized recurring revenue impacts of selling new services to existing customers and the negative recognized recurring revenue impacts of contraction and attrition among this set of customers. Our Net Dollar Retention Rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the growing level of our revenue base, the level of penetration within our customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our customers. Our calculation of Net Dollar Retention Rate may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies.\n\n_Remaining Performance Obligations._ Remaining Performance Obligations represents the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been delivered, including both subscription and professional services revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations consists of both deferred revenue and contracted non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. We expect to recognize 59% of our Remaining Performance Obligations as revenue over the next 12 months, and the remainder thereafter, in each case, in accordance with our revenue recognition policy; however, we cannot guarantee that any portion of our Remaining Performance Obligations will be recognized as revenue within the timeframe we expect or at all.\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets (U.S.

(“Kaltura” or the “Company”), the video experience cloud, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, as well as outlook for the third quarter and full year 2024.\n\n“We delivered record annualized recurring revenue (\"ARR\") in the second quarter, making it our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, while also posting a sequential and year-over-year increase in new bookings and sustaining the improved gross retention rate we saw in the first quarter. It was also our fourth consecutive quarter of Adjusted EBITDA profitability, and its highest result since the third quarter of 2020. Accordingly, we are incrementally raising our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year and are reaffirming our plans to achieve positive cash flow from operations in 2024,” said Ron Yekutiel, Kaltura Co-founder, Chairman, President and CEO.\n\nMr. Yekutiel continued “Looking to the second half of 2024 and beyond, we continue to believe there are strong tailwinds ahead of us, as we are seeing companies re-accelerate their investments in digital transformation and online experiences. Fueling these initiatives are factors such as an increasingly hybrid workplace, growth in Gen-Z & millennial video-savvy employees, cost savings by consolidating multiple enterprise video use-cases around a single video platform, and the advent of Gen-AI, which we expect will bring about more creation and consumption of videos and increased ROI. We believe these trends will continue to grow our new bookings, accelerate our revenue growth, and increase our profits.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * **Revenue** for the second quarter of 2024 was $44.0 million, compared to $43.9 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **Subscription revenue** for the second quarter of 2024was $41.0 million, an increase of 1% compared to $40.7 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR)** for the second quarter of 2024 was$165.2 million, an increase of 1% compared to $163.4 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **GAAP** **Gross profit** for the second quarter of 2024 was $28.7 million, representing a gross margin of 65% compared to a GAAP gross profit of $28.6 million and gross margin of 65% for the second quarter of 2023. \n  * **Non-GAAP** **Gross profit** for the second quarter of 2024 was $29.0 million, representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 66%, compared to a non-GAAP gross profit of $29.0 million and non-GAAP gross margin of 66% for the second quarter of 2023. \n  * **GAAP** **Operating loss** was $8.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **Non-GAAP** **Operating profit** was $0.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $2.0 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **GAAP Net loss** was $10.0 million or $0.07 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a GAAP net loss of $10.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **Non-GAAP Net loss** was $1.0 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $3.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** was $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net Cash Used in Operating Activities** was $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $4.1 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Business Highlights:**\n\n  * Closed 23 six-digit deals (banking, government, pharma, tech, education, and media & telecom companies).\n  * Highest new bookings since the fourth quarter of 2022.\n  * Same gross retention rate as the first quarter, representing an improvement over each of the quarters in 2023.\n  * Launched a number of AI product enhancements, including an AI-based Automatic Speech Recognition service, an AI-based email notification engine, a real-time AI-based sentiment analysis within user chats, an AI-based quiz generator, and AI-based noise cancellation for improved audio.\n  * Won multiple industry awards: the 2024 Innovation in Business MarTech Awards for best Virtual Event Platform, the 2024 Event Technology Awards for best Virtual and Hybrid Event Platform, and four 2024 Eventex awards for best Event Technology, best Audience Engagement Technology, best Data Collection/Event Analytics Technology, and best Virtual Event Platform.\n  * Hosted “Kaltura Connect on the Road 2024” - a series of three exclusive events around the world, with hundreds of attendees, focusing on how AI-infused video experiences can boost business results.\n\n\n\n**Financial Outlook:**\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Kaltura currently expects:\n\n  * **Subscription Revenue** to grow (decline) by (1)%-1% year-over-year to between $40.5 million and $41.2 million.\n  * **Total Revenue** to be flat to down 2% year-over-year to between $42.6 million and $43.3 million.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** to be in the range of negative $0.3 million to $0.7 million.\n\n\n\nFor the full year ending December 31, 2024, Kaltura currently expects:\n\n  * **Subscription Revenue** to be flat to up 2% year-over-year to between $163.2 million and $165.2 million.\n  * **Total Revenue** to be flat to up 1% year-over-year to between $174.7 million and $176.7 million.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** to be in the range of $2.0 million to $3.0 million.\n\n\n\nThe guidance provided above contains forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. Refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Kaltura has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net loss within this press release because the Company is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to calculate certain reconciling items with confidence. The reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA includes but is not limited to the following items: stock-based compensation expenses, depreciation, amortization, financial expenses (income), net, provision for income tax, and other non-recurring operating expenses. These items, which could materially affect the computation of forward-looking GAAP net loss, are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, some of which are outside of the Company’s control.\n\nAdditional information on Kaltura’s reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, is included in the financial tables below.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nKaltura will host a conference call today on August 8, 2024 to review its second quarter 2024 financial results and to discuss its financial outlook.\n\nTime:| 8:00 a.m. ET  \n---|---  \nUnited States/Canada Toll Free:| 1-877-407-0789  \nInternational Toll:| 1-201-689-8562  \n  \nA live webcast will also be available in the Investor Relations section of Kaltura’s website at: https://investors.kaltura.com/news-and-events/events\n\nA replay of the webcast will be available in the Investor Relations section of the company’s web site approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call and remain available for approximately 30 calendar days.\n\n**About Kaltura**\n\nKaltura’s mission is to power any video experience for any organization.

All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding our future financial and operating performance, including our guidance; our business strategy, plans and objectives for future operations; and general economic, business and industry conditions, including expectations with respect to trends in corporate spending.\n\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “due,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “plan,” “predict,” “potential,” “positioned,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and future trends, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on our historical performance and our current plans, estimates and expectations and are not a representation that such plans, estimates, or expectations will be achieved. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations as of the date of this press release. Subsequent events may cause these expectations to change, and we disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements in the future, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.\n\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the current volatile economic climate and its direct and indirect impact on our business and operations; political, economic, and military conditions in Israel and other geographies; our ability to retain our customers and meet demand; our ability to achieve and maintain profitability; the evolution of the markets for our offerings; our ability to keep pace with technological and competitive developments; our ability to maintain the interoperability of our offerings across devices, operating systems and third-party applications; risks associated with our Application Programming Interfaces, other components in our offerings and other intellectual property; risks associated with our use of certain artificial intelligence and machine learning models; our ability to compete successfully against current and future competitors; our ability to increase customer revenue; risks related to our approach to revenue recognition; our potential exposure to cybersecurity threats; our compliance with data privacy and data protection laws; our ability to meet our contractual commitments; our reliance on third parties; our ability to retain our key personnel; risks related to our international operations; risks related to our revenue mix and customer base; risks related to potential acquisitions; our ability to generate or raise additional capital; and the other risks under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as such factors may be updated from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations page of our website at investors.kaltura.com.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nKaltura has provided in this press release and the accompanying tables measures of financial information that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin (calculated as a percentage of revenue), non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin (calculated as a percentage of revenue), non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA. Kaltura defines these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective corresponding GAAP measure, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) facility exit and transition costs; (4) restructuring charges; and (5) war-related costs. Kaltura defines EBITDA as net profit (loss) before financial expenses (income), net, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (as defined above), adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance, such as non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, facility exit and transition costs, restructuring charges and other non-recurring operating expenses. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Kaltura’s financial condition and results of operations. These non-GAAP metrics are a supplemental measure of our performance, are not defined by or presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net profit (loss) or any other performance measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented because we believe that they provide useful supplemental information to investors and analysts regarding our operating performance and are frequently used by these parties in evaluating companies in our industry. By presenting these non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. Additionally, our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of our performance because they assist us in comparing the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis between periods, as described above. Although we use the non-GAAP financial measures described above, such measures have significant limitations as analytical tools and only supplement but do not replace, our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. See the tables below regarding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**Key Financial and Operating Metrics**\n\n_Annualized Recurring Revenue._ We use Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) as a measure of our revenue trend and an indicator of our future revenue opportunity from existing recurring customer contracts. We calculate ARR by annualizing our recurring revenue for the most recently completed fiscal quarter. Recurring revenues are generated from SaaS and PaaS subscriptions, as well as term licenses for software installed on the customer's premises (“On-Prem”). For the SaaS and PaaS components, we calculate ARR by annualizing the actual recurring revenue recognized for the latest fiscal quarter. For the On-Prem components for which revenue recognition is not ratable across the license term, we calculate ARR for each contract by dividing the total contract value (excluding professional services) as of the last day of the specified period by the number of days in the contract term and then multiplying by 365. Recurring revenue excludes revenue from one-time professional services and setup fees. ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future customer cancellations, upgrades or downgrades or price increases or decreases. The amount of actual revenue that we recognize over any 12-month period is likely to differ from ARR at the beginning of that period, sometimes significantly. This may occur due to new bookings, cancellations, upgrades or downgrades, pending renewals, professional services revenue, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions or divestitures. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as it is an operating metric and is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue. Our calculation of ARR may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies.\n\n_Net Dollar Retention Rate._ Our Net Dollar Retention Rate, which we use to measure our success in retaining and growing recurring revenue from our existing customers, compares our recognized recurring revenue from a set of customers across comparable periods. We calculate our Net Dollar Retention Rate for a given period as the recognized recurring revenue from the latest reported fiscal quarter from the set of customers whose revenue existed in the reported fiscal quarter from the prior year (the numerator), divided by recognized recurring revenue from such customers for the same fiscal quarter in the prior year (denominator). For annual periods, we report Net Dollar Retention Rate as the arithmetic average of the Net Dollar Retention Rate for all fiscal quarters included in the period. We consider subdivisions of the same legal entity (for example, divisions of a parent company or separate campuses that are part of the same state university system) ,as well as Value-add Resellers (“VARs”) (meaning resellers that directly manage the relationship with the customer) and the customers they manage, to be a single customer for purposes of calculating our Net Dollar Retention Rate. Our calculation of Net Dollar Retention Rate for any fiscal period includes the positive recognized recurring revenue impacts of selling new services to existing customers and the negative recognized recurring revenue impacts of contraction and attrition among this set of customers. Our Net Dollar Retention Rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the growing level of our revenue base, the level of penetration within our customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our customers. Our calculation of Net Dollar Retention Rate may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies.\n\n_Remaining Performance Obligations._ Remaining Performance Obligations represents the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been delivered, including both subscription and professional services revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations consists of both deferred revenue and contracted non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. We expect to recognize 60% of our Remaining Performance Obligations as revenue over the next 12 months, and the remainder thereafter, in each case, in accordance with our revenue recognition policy; however, we cannot guarantee that any portion of our Remaining Performance Obligations will be recognized as revenue within the timeframe we expect or at all.\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets (U.S.
