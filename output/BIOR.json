(Nasdaq: BIOR), the biotech company reimagining therapeutic delivery, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. The company will not host a conference call.\n\n“We’ve made much faster progress than anticipated developing a smaller BioJet device that is highly desired by pharma companies,” said Adi Mohanty, Chief Executive Officer of Biora Therapeutics. “We recently presented initial animal data on our 00-size, clinical BioJet device. We were able to increase device capacity while decreasing overall size, giving BioJet the largest payload capacity of anything in the ingestible injectables category, and further increasing the number of drugs that can be delivered.”\n\n“The rapid development allowed us to reassess our partnering strategy, making the decision to shift from a co-development model to a focus on licensing the 00-size clinical BioJet device. We expect to pursue licensing agreements within multiple verticals in the near term, which we believe is preferable to a single co-development partner for a period of time. There has been tremendous interest from our pharma collaborators, both existing and new parties, and our capacity for testing various molecules during Q1 is starting to fill up. We continue to believe, based on our extensive engagement with many pharma companies, that BioJet is the category-leading technology for oral delivery of macromolecules. We look forward to testing in a more advanced animal model during Q4 and enabling progress into IND-enabling studies,” stated Mr. Mohanty.\n\n“Regarding our NaviCap platform, following a successful Phase 1 trial of BT-600, our team has concluded that the results may support proceeding to a larger clinical trial in ulcerative colitis patients, instead of the smaller Phase 1B trial we had been planning. We are working to facilitate the proper regulatory interactions to determine the next steps for this program,” continued Mr. Mohanty.\n\n“We are working with our noteholders and investors to potentially increase the company’s capitalization with the goal of maintaining our Nasdaq listing status after December 9. We appreciate the support of many of these investors as they have continued to provide funds to progress our programs, although their commitment cannot be guaranteed going forward. We are actively engaged with many parties regarding strategic alternatives and plan to provide a more detailed update soon,” stated Mr. Mohanty.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights**\n\n_NaviCap™ Targeted Oral Delivery Platform and BT-600 in ulcerative colitis_\n\n  * **Presented Phase 1 Clinical Trial Data at ACG 2024.** Biora presented a summary of the Phase 1 clinical trial results for BT-600 at the American College of Gastroenterology Annual Meeting, receiving a Presidential Poster Award from ACG for high quality, novel research. The poster can be viewed [on the company’s website](https://www.bioratherapeutics.com/publications/single-ascending-dose-results-from-a-phase-1-clinical-trial-of-bt-600-a-combination-product-of-the-navicap-targeted-oral-delivery-platform-and-tofacitinib).\n\n\n\n_BioJet™ Systemic Oral Delivery Platform Preclinical Development_\n\n  * **Smaller, 00-Size BioJet Clinical Device.** Biora recently announced a smaller version of the BioJet device based on market research indicating strong patient preference for a smaller, 00-size capsule. The smaller device uses the same core technology of internal, liquid jet injection that has been proven in over 30 animal studies to date. \n    * Payload capacity was increased while decreasing the overall size of the device from a 000-size capsule to a 00-size. The BioJet device now has a payload capacity of over 300 microliters, enabling delivery of upwards of 50 milligram doses, even for molecules that are difficult to concentrate, such as antibodies.\n    * The 00-size BioJet device is designed to be more easily tested in non-human primates. It has also been designed for compatibility with human clinical trial requirements and ease of automated manufacturing, including sterile fill and finish. Biora’s clinical and regulatory experience with the NaviCap platform informed this work and helped to streamline BioJet development.\n    * Biora has tested the trigger function of the 00-size device on the bench as well as in animals, achieving almost 100% device performance. The company is now conducting further animal studies to confirm complete device function with a test molecule.\n\n\n\n_Other Matters_\n\n  * **Recent Financings.** Biora partially drew down the facility put in place in August with its lead investors and complemented this funding source with approximately $4M in equity raises through registered direct and ATM program routes.\n  * **Nasdaq Compliance.** Biora received an extension to December 9 from Nasdaq to comply with the market value of securities requirement. No further extensions are available beyond that date. The company is in active negotiations with its lead investors to increase the company’s capitalization.\n  * **Operating Expenses.** Biora recently realigned its resources to focus on its BioJet program to ensure it can deliver in the short term the results needed by large pharma collaborators to progress licensing and partnering discussions. The company was able to reduce operating expenses and effective operating cash burn by about 40%, to less than $2.5 million per month on a going forward basis.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * Biora anticipates sharing data from additional canine studies with the double-zero size BioJet device during Q4 2024.\n  * Biora plans to perform studies of the double-zero Biora device with its own molecules in non-human primates during Q4 2024.\n  * The company anticipates announcing an additional expanded collaboration agreement to test the double-zero BioJet device in primates during Q4 2024.\n  * Testing of collaborators’ molecules in primates is anticipated to begin in early 2025, with that round of testing completed during Q1 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024_**\n\nOperating expenses were $16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, including $1.3 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, compared to $16.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, including $1.6 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nNet loss was $18.4 million, including non-cash items of $4.0 million attributable to an extinguishment loss and the change in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities, and a gain from discontinued operations of $3.8 million, while net loss per share was $5.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $6.5 million, including non-cash items of $22.8 million attributable to the change in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities, while diluted net loss per share was $0.35 for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**_Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023_**\n\nOperating expenses were $16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, including $1.3 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, compared to $23.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, including $10.5 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, primarily attributable to a one-time charge of approximately $9.0 million related to vesting of employees' restricted stock units (RSUs) in 2023.\n\nNet loss was $18.4 million, net of non-cash items of $4.0 million attributable to the change in fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities, and a gain from discontinued operations of $3.8 million, while net loss per share was $5.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $73.5 million, including non-cash items of $62.2 million attributable to an inducement loss of $53.2 million and a one-time stock-based compensation charge noted above, while net loss per share was $48.89 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**About Biora Therapeutics** Biora Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotech company developing two smart pill-based therapeutics platforms: the [NaviCap™ platform for colon-targeted treatment of IBD](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pYXG9zCq9XxdmttX6AbrjrQpQxK0HOlDHTWjk5nCqu36WlGt-eXG-aZHZnf6oS84k5jG_TjwH7_g-VkamBsHCwNAjTD2exh1veYL_jM98_-dlEThnir-YPARpDUaHSIkfjoVj7UfiCw0kYzmWm9n-GhsWYIjlFDTofTSJzjOQ6phNNBvoTJ-PJu0vAvOXULE), designed to improve patient outcomes through treatment at the site of disease in the gastrointestinal tract, and the [BioJet™ platform for oral delivery of large molecules](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wqjDvkyA4azanbxmth9L9hK-F7nDL0iW5L8PK64nsIkhdJNJFZb12SvbObKiKvs3Bg1NanI1gRxny_tf51RB5StCulBQp1ewY3HGIpiDlkZtXhgx2_EhH8kaBt3PC2k10P3IllFR-UUrQ_GC2ZtsK0QyQRDB-4tzoERIhOdylQh3LBdyMx0JNXtk_jYZLtC0), designed to replace injection with needle-free, oral delivery. \n\nFor more information, visit [bioratherapeutics.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EvaKrb3s4z-QosZFYWBFf1i_jL1wZap9fxFPgFbdJfCjp4Ogsu1rLzu6NmCzWjkgcFU8DU1GIVonC51YqLYhSoNso8hOFl-eTUrlpGrSYYE=) or follow the company on [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oL2_UYohQfmcG3KPfPR8faDIpOuIARhsampxIrD_yvcf9rrg0Ke06afIn74zj0QKa8Zt3uiTzWnBSsdfDU9B3R3x-VyhqjXt-muf0RsHT4la0IQ3-aSawusWvj0m_XkO) or [Twitter](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KOmSXerKvMb3gise7cHCS6RMECFtAJswXjZb5wpaO6XsomGR_F1PjzMuLJiTf6N8TdAJAwoasAxeKedvTbjdpA==).\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement or Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties and are based on estimates and assumptions.

In addition, in a concurrent private placement, the Company will issue unregistered warrants to purchase up to 745,342 shares of common stock.
