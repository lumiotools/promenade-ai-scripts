CrowdStrike uses its GAAP provision for income taxes for the purpose of determining its non-GAAP income tax expense. The tax costs for intellectual property integration relating to acquisitions are included in the GAAP provision for income taxes. The income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles assets, including purchased patents, acquisition related expenses, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, gains and other income from strategic investments attributable to CrowdStrike, July 19 Incident related costs and (recoveries), net, and legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits included in the GAAP provision for income taxes were not material for all periods presented.  \n2. For periods in which CrowdStrike had diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, the sum of the impact of individual reconciling items may not total to diluted Non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders because of rounding differences.  \n  \n**CROWDSTRIKE HOLDINGS, INC.**  \n---  \n**GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations (continued)**  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \n(unaudited)  \n**Three Months Ended October 31,**| **Nine Months Ended October 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nGAAP net cash provided by operating activities| $| 326,136| $| 273,518| $| 1,036,005| $| 819,191  \nPurchases of property and equipment| (78,704| )| (21,264| )| (167,641| )| (123,945| )  \nCapitalized internal-use software and website development costs| (16,271| )| (12,630| )| (41,266| )| (38,605| )  \nPurchases of deferred compensation investments| (606| )| (586| )| (1,815| )| (1,462| )  \nProceeds from sales of deferred compensation investments| —| —| (41| )| —  \nFree cash flow| $| 230,555| $| 239,038| $| 825,242| $| 655,179  \nGAAP net cash used in investing activities| $| (105,581| )| $| (468,836| )| $| (211,569| )| $| (361,045| )  \nGAAP net cash provided by financing activities| $| 844| $| 2,053| $| 60,822| $| 59,698  \nGAAP net cash provided by operating activities as a percentage of revenue| 32| %| 35| %| 36| %| 37| %  \nPurchases of property and equipment as a percentage of revenue| (8| )%| (3| )%| (6| )%| (6| )%  \nCapitalized internal-use software and website development costs as a percentage of revenue| (2| )%| (2| )%| (1| )%| (2| )%  \nPurchases of deferred compensation investments as a percentage of revenue| —| %| —| %| —| %| —| %  \nProceeds from sale of deferred compensation investments| —| %| —| %| —| %| —| %  \nFree cash flow margin| 23| %| 30| %| 29| %| 30| %  \n  \n**Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to determining results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), CrowdStrike believes the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance. CrowdStrike uses the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. CrowdStrike believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these measures eliminate the effects of certain variables unrelated to CrowdStrike’s overall operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOther companies, including companies in CrowdStrike’s industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of CrowdStrike’s non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate CrowdStrike’s business.\n\n_**Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Subscription Gross Margin**_\n\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP subscription gross profit and non-GAAP subscription gross margin as GAAP subscription gross profit and GAAP subscription gross margin, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n\n_**Non-GAAP Income from Operations**_\n\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP income from operations as GAAP income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, and July 19 Incident related costs and (recoveries), net.\n\n_**Non-GAAP Net Income Attributable to CrowdStrike**_\n\nThe company defines non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to CrowdStrike excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including purchased patents), acquisition-related expenses (credits), net, amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, mark-to-market adjustments on deferred compensation liabilities, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, July 19 Incident related costs and (recoveries), net, acquisition-related provision (benefit) for income taxes, losses (gains) and other income from strategic investments, and losses (gains) on deferred compensation assets.\n\n_**Non-GAAP Net Income per Share Attributable to CrowdStrike Common Stockholders, Diluted**_\n\nCrowdStrike defines non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders, as non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.\n\n_**Free Cash Flow**_\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that CrowdStrike defines as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software and website development costs, purchases of deferred compensation investments, and proceeds from sale of deferred compensation investments. CrowdStrike monitors free cash flow as one measure of its overall business performance, which enables CrowdStrike to analyze its future performance without the effects of non-cash items and allow CrowdStrike to better understand the cash needs of its business. While CrowdStrike believes that free cash flow is useful in evaluating its business, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool, and free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP. The utility of free cash flow as a measure of CrowdStrike’s liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in CrowdStrike’s cash balance for any given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in CrowdStrike's industry, may calculate free cash flow differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison.\n\n**Explanation of Operational Measures**\n\n _**Annual Recurring Revenue**_\n\nARR is calculated as the annualized value of CrowdStrike’s customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. To the extent that CrowdStrike is negotiating a renewal with a customer after the expiration of the subscription, CrowdStrike continues to include that revenue in ARR if CrowdStrike is actively in discussion with such an organization for a new subscription or renewal, or until such organization notifies CrowdStrike that it is not renewing its subscription.\n\n_**Magic Number**_\n\nMagic Number is calculated by performing the following calculation for the most recent four quarters and taking the average: annualizing the difference between a quarter’s Subscription Revenue and the prior quarter’s Subscription Revenue, and then dividing the resulting number by the previous quarter’s Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense. Magic Number = Average of previous four quarters: ((Quarter GAAP Subscription Revenue – Prior Quarter GAAP Subscription Revenue) x 4) / Prior Quarter Non-GAAP Sales & Marketing Expense.\n\n_**Free Cash Flow Rule of 40**_\n\nFree cash flow rule of 40 is calculated by taking the current quarter total revenue year over year growth rate percentage and summing it with the current quarter free cash flow margin percentage.\n\n_**Dollar-Based Gross Retention Rate**_\n\nDollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end is calculated by starting with the ARR from all subscription customers as of 12 months prior to such period, or Prior Period ARR. Then deduct from the Prior Period ARR any ARR from subscription customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Remaining ARR. Then divide the total Current Period Remaining ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of ARR from all subscription customers as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn.\n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241126970319r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241126970319/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241126970319/en/)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact** CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
