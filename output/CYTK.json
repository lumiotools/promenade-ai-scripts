Cytokinetics is also eligible to receive up to €490 million in commercial milestone payments upon the achievement by Bayer of certain sales milestones, and tiered royalties on net sales of _aficamten_ in Japan.\n\nThis collaboration leverages Cytokinetics’ broad development program of _aficamten_ and Bayer’s regional capabilities and expertise in the development and commercialization of therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases of unmet need for the benefit of patients in Japan.\n\nUnder the joint development plan, Bayer will conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial in Japanese patients with obstructive HCM and Cytokinetics will expand ACACIA-HCM, the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ in patients with non-obstructive HCM, into Japan to support the potential marketing authorization of _aficamten_ in Japan and CEDAR-HCM, its ongoing study for a pediatric population of patients with obstructive HCM.\n\n“As we pursue commercialization of _aficamten_ in the U.S. and Europe, we are pleased to enter into this partnership with Bayer to leverage their cardiovascular commitment and expertise to potentially bring _aficamten_ to an even greater number of patients suffering from HCM,” said Robert I. Blum, Cytokinetics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “This important regional deal follows on our rich history of collaborations to expand potential access to our innovative science.”\n\n“We are very excited by the potential of _aficamten_ as seen in previous studies and look forward to bringing this treatment option to Japanese patients as soon as possible,” said Juergen Eckhardt, M.D., Head of Business Development and Licensing at Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals Division. “This collaboration underscores our mission to bring transformative treatments to patients with high unmet cardiovascular needs by leveraging our extensive drug development expertise from early discovery through regulatory approval, life cycle management and commercialization.”\n\nFor a complete description of the License and Collaboration Agreement detailed in this press release, please refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 19, 2024.\n\n**About**** _Aficamten_**\n\n_Aficamten_ is an investigational selective, small molecule cardiac myosin inhibitor discovered following an extensive chemical optimization program that was conducted with careful attention to therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic properties and as may translate into next-in-class potential in clinical development. _Aficamten_ was designed to reduce the number of active actin-myosin cross bridges during each cardiac cycle and consequently suppress the myocardial hypercontractility that is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In preclinical models, _aficamten_ reduced myocardial contractility by binding directly to cardiac myosin at a distinct and selective allosteric binding site, thereby preventing myosin from entering a force producing state.\n\nThe development program for _aficamten_ is assessing its potential as a treatment that improves exercise capacity and relieves symptoms in patients with HCM as well as its potential long-term effects on cardiac structure and function _. Aficamten_ was evaluated in SEQUOIA-HCM (**S** afety, **E** fficacy, and **Q** uantitative **U** nderstanding of **O** bstruction **I** mpact of **_A_** _ficamten_ in **HCM**), a positive pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). _Aficamten_ received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China. Cytokinetics submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA in Q3 2024 and expects to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Q4 2024.\n\n_Aficamten_ is also currently being evaluated in MAPLE-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ as monotherapy compared to metoprolol as monotherapy in patients with obstructive HCM, ACACIA-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ in patients with non-obstructive HCM, CEDAR-HCM, a clinical trial of _aficamten_ in a pediatric population with obstructive HCM, and FOREST-HCM, an open-label extension clinical study of _aficamten_ in patients with HCM.\n\n**About Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease in which the heart muscle (myocardium) becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). The thickening of cardiac muscle leads to the inside of the left ventricle becoming smaller and stiffer, and thus the ventricle becomes less able to relax and fill with blood. This ultimately limits the heart’s pumping function, resulting in reduced exercise capacity and symptoms including chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or fainting during physical activity. HCM is the most common monogenic inherited cardiovascular disorder, with approximately 280,000 patients diagnosed, however, there are an estimated 400,000-800,000 additional patients who remain undiagnosed in the U.S.1,2,3 Two-thirds of patients with HCM have obstructive HCM (oHCM), where the thickening of the cardiac muscle leads to left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, while one-third have non-obstructive HCM (nHCM), where blood flow isn’t impacted, but the heart muscle is still thickened. People with HCM are at high risk of also developing cardiovascular complications including atrial fibrillation, stroke and mitral valve disease.4 People with HCM are at risk for potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias and it is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death in younger people or athletes.5 A subset of patients with HCM are at high risk of progressive disease leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure necessitating cardiac transplantation.\n\n**About Cytokinetics **\n\nCytokinetics is a late-stage, specialty cardiovascular biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing muscle biology-directed drug candidates as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which cardiac muscle performance is compromised. As a leader in muscle biology and the mechanics of muscle performance, the company is developing small molecule drug candidates specifically engineered to impact myocardial muscle function and contractility. Following positive results from SEQUOIA-HCM, the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating _aficamten,_ a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), Cytokinetics submitted an NDA for _aficamten_ to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration and is progressing regulatory submissions for _aficamten_ for the treatment of obstructive HCM in Europe. _Aficamten_ is also currently being evaluated in MAPLE-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ as monotherapy compared to metoprolol as monotherapy in patients with obstructive HCM, ACACIA-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ in patients with non-obstructive HCM, CEDAR-HCM, a clinical trial of _aficamten_ in a pediatric population with obstructive HCM, and FOREST-HCM, an open-label extension clinical study of _aficamten_ in patients with HCM. Cytokinetics is also developing _omecamtiv mecarbil_ , a cardiac muscle activator, in patients with heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), CK-586, a cardiac myosin inhibitor with a mechanism of action distinct from _aficamten_ for the potential treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and CK-089, a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator with potential therapeutic application to a specific type of muscular dystrophy and other conditions of impaired muscle function.\n\nFor additional information about Cytokinetics, visit [www.cytokinetics.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dElIUBgh6i_WJO3vf1GTpl2Pkk8skA25ZC2Mnt1m3TL0eFdSfeWp93hwhLfmBNbU3DxO47tXjEkGGnedY7Zt-HNak2VfTcyDkC0Eby12Lmo=) and follow us on [X](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UTbl1VfMKdV0cITgkpppWe0LiwteLxQQWSt5_oPOlLw0SRiTx78gZeQrHeMtzBREQaWgZpBgvGLZRylGcvFaRA==), [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zZjU2DoP_CyBdXe-goxqAD72xNU1VO4KFxakFyZQ1iOUSc4F5LMUMLkAHAEmxkpJ5ULUP_alaxnH0KydiIugO1XIxBu87tZKsu2yY5HtnGA=), [Facebook](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=a_rEtEyMd5AcoQ2a7YlLLJdvDb2aD-FhzCdTBXPKTsuOKjv0va0EN74redCfAIit6nPi1frINJkhZKlbB0-NTAGyaC9MPjFisYOG0AVk7jo=) and [YouTube](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=g51ZHy-rnBGVFWapk0A8jvOOrYQL2JgNDIgBvlfPr7lGP_ueS2UiPDQ55mMcTH2fJeVZSFbrM5xAEbl0MJKvxlg1qpHWnbvkrbwhoVta2Dv4ZEeclXrMf8VOQ63BOO-O).\n\n**About Bayer**\n\nBayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the life science fields of health care and nutrition.

Of the 8,232 patients included in the analysis, patients were on average 64.5 years old, with 54.5% aged ≥65 years. At baseline, patients aged ≥65 years were more likely to be women, have atrial fibrillation or flutter, have worse New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class and have higher NT-proBNP as compared to patients aged <65 years. Over a median follow-up period of 21.8 months, the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure events occurred at a rate of 21.4 per 100 patient years among patients <65 years, and 28.8 per 100 patient years in patients ≥65 years. In the overall study population, the treatment effect of _omecamtiv mecarbil_ was similar across age groups (interaction p=0.73). In patients with severe heart failure, _omecamtiv mecarbil_ reduced the risk for the primary outcome independent of age group (HR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92 and HR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.97 for patients <65 years and ≥65 years respectively; interaction p=0.72). These relative risk reductions were associated with large absolute risk reductions (8.6 and 7.9, respectively). Additionally, adverse events of special interest, such as ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and myocardial ischemic events were similar between _omecamtiv mecarbil_ and placebo in both age groups.\n\n**Ventricular Arrythmias Associated with Adverse Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction; Treatment with**** _Omecamtiv Mecarbil_****Reduces Risk of Ventricular Arrythmias in Patients with Severely Reduced LVEF**\n\nA second post-hoc analysis from GALACTIC-HF investigated clinical consequences of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) in the patients studied in GALACTIC-HF. Of the 8,232 patients enrolled in GALACTIC-HF, following an occurrence of VA, there was a significantly higher risk of the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure events (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.42-1.97; p<0.001) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.07; 95% CI 1.77-2.42; p<0.001). Treatment with _omecamtiv mecarbil_ was not associated with an increase in the occurrence of VA and the occurrence of VA in participants treated with _omecamtiv mecarbil_ did not impart worse prognosis than those with VA compared to placebo. Of note, participants with lower LVEF had an increased risk of VA, and in those participants, treatment with _omecamtiv mecarbil_ appeared to reduce the risk for the composite outcome of VA, cardiac arrest and sudden death (LVEF ≤28%, HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.94; p=0.009, Figure 1). Overall, these findings support the safety of _omecamtiv mecarbil_ with regards to VA as well as a potential benefit in patients with severely reduced LVEF and are consistent with the findings of increased treatment effect of _omecamtiv mecarbil_ in patients with severely reduced LVEF.\n\n![Figure 1 - Cumulative Incidence of the Composite Endpoint and Sudden Death in GALACTIC-H](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/ee1006b4-fa47-4800-8929-5cdb837d546e/figure-1-cumulative-incidence-of-the-composite-endpoint-and-sudden-death-in-galactic-hf-v2.png)\n\n**About**** _Omecamtiv Mecarbil_**\n\n_Omecamtiv mecarbil_ is an investigational, selective, small molecule cardiac myosin activator, the first of a novel class of myotropes1 designed to directly target the contractile mechanisms of the heart, binding to and recruiting more cardiac myosin heads to interact with actin during systole. _Omecamtiv mecarbil_ is designed to increase the number of active actin-myosin cross bridges during each cardiac cycle and consequently augment the impaired contractility that is associated with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Preclinical research has shown that  _omecamtiv mecarbil_ increases cardiac contractility without increasing intracellular myocyte calcium concentrations or myocardial oxygen consumption.2-4\n\nThe development program for _omecamtiv mecarbil_ assessed its potential for the treatment of HFrEF. Positive results from GALACTIC-HF, the first Phase 3 clinical trial of _omecamtiv mecarbil_ demonstrated a statistically significant effect of treatment with _omecamtiv mecarbil_ to reduce risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death or heart failure events (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure) compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care. No reduction in the secondary endpoint of time to CV death was observed. In general, the overall rates of myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias and death were similar between treatment and placebo groups. Adverse events and treatment discontinuation of study drug were balanced between treatment arms. The magnitude of the treatment effect in a pre-specified subgroup of more than 4,000 patients with heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction (<30%) was observed to be greater than in the overall drug treated population of GALACTIC-HF. _Omecamtiv mecarbil_ will be the subject of COMET-HF (**C** onfirmation of **_O_** _mecamtiv_** _M_** _ecarbil_ **E** fficacy **T** rial in **H** eart**F** ailure), a confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction, expected to start in Q4 2024.\n\n**About Heart Failure with Severely Reduced Ejection Fraction**\n\nHeart failure is a grievous condition that affects more than 64 million people worldwide5 about half of whom have reduced left ventricular function.6,7 It is the leading cause of hospitalization and readmission in people age 65 and older.8,9 By 2029 is it estimated that 2.8 million people in the U.S. will have heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction10, characterized as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) <30%, and 840,000 people will have severely reduced ejection fraction with other features indicative of high risk heart failure.11 Patients with high risk heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction account for approximately 60% of all HFrEF hospitalizations, with 35% of patients re-hospitalized within a year. 12,13\n\n**About Cytokinetics **\n\nCytokinetics is a late-stage, specialty cardiovascular biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing muscle biology-directed drug candidates as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which cardiac muscle performance is compromised. As a leader in muscle biology and the mechanics of muscle performance, the company is developing small molecule drug candidates specifically engineered to impact myocardial muscle function and contractility. Following positive results from SEQUOIA-HCM, the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating _aficamten,_ a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), Cytokinetics submitted an NDA for _aficamten_ to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration and is progressing regulatory submissions for _aficamten_ for the treatment of obstructive HCM in Europe. _Aficamten_ is also currently being evaluated in MAPLE-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ as monotherapy compared to metoprolol as monotherapy in patients with obstructive HCM, ACACIA-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ in patients with non-obstructive HCM, CEDAR-HCM, a clinical trial of _aficamten_ in a pediatric population with obstructive HCM, and FOREST-HCM, an open-label extension clinical study of _aficamten_ in patients with HCM.

Prolonged VO2Rec has previously been linked to adverse outcomes in patients with other forms of heart failure. The analysis demonstrated that treatment with _aficamten_ significantly shortened times for VO2Rec to decline by 12.5% (VO2Rec T12.5%), 25% (VO2Rec T25%) and 50% (VO2Rec T50%) of peak VO2, corresponding to absolute reductions relative to placebo of 8 seconds (p<0.001), 7 seconds (p<0.001) and 8 seconds (p=0.01), respectively (Table 1). Additionally, a decrease in VO2Rec T12.5% corresponded to a decrease in NT-proBNP levels (p<0.001), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels (hs-cTnI) (p<0.001), resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOT-G) (p=0.003) and Valsalva LVOT-G (p=0.003).\n\nTable 1.

EQ-5D-5L (range from 0 to 1) and EQ-VAS (range from 0 to 100) were measured at baseline through Week 24, with higher scores indicating better QoL. At baseline, there were no differences between patients receiving _aficamten_ and placebo in any of the five domains of the EQ-5D-5L index. Treatment with _aficamten_ improved the EQ-5D-5L index score by 0.04 (p=0.008) and the EQ-VAS score by 4.5 points (p=0.002) compared to placebo, with significant differences observed as early as eight weeks after treatment initiation (p=0.005). Following withdrawal of treatment at the end of the clinical trial, QoL benefits in patients who were receiving _aficamten_ subsequently decreased. These data demonstrate that treatment with _aficamten_ yielded early, sustained and significant improvement in overall health-related QoL among patients with obstructive HCM as measured by EQ-5D-5L, reinforcing previously reported data showing that _aficamten_ improves QoL as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).\n\n**Treatment with**** _Aficamten_****Durably Reduces SRT-Eligibility After 12 Weeks in Open-Label Extension**\n\nFindings from an analysis from FOREST-HCM (**F** ollow-Up, **O** pen-Label, **R** esearch **E** valuation of **S** ustained **T** reatment with _Aficamten_ in **HCM**), the open-label extension clinical study of _aficamten_ in patients with HCM, related to the efficacy and safety of  _aficamten_ in patients who at baseline were guideline-eligible for septal reduction therapy (SRT) were also presented. Of the 280 patients with obstructive HCM enrolled in FOREST-HCM with ≥12 weeks of follow-up at the time of this analysis, 97 (35%) met guideline eligibility criteria for SRT at baseline; after 12 weeks of treatment with _aficamten_ , only 3 (3%) remained SRT guideline-eligible. When comparing those patients who were SRT guideline-eligible versus those who were not at baseline, there were similar, robust improvements in KCCQ, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class, NT-proBNP and resting and Valsalva left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient. Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were modest and similar between SRT-eligible and SRT-ineligible patients. Instances of LVEF <50% and atrial fibrillation or flutter were rare, and similar between groups. These results demonstrate that treatment with _aficamten_ may provide a safe, durable and effective alternative to SRT in many patients with obstructive HCM.\n\n**Analyses of Real-World Data Reveals Differences in Costs Across Gender, Age and Race/Ethnicity in Patients with Obstructive HCM**\n\nA new health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) study presented today evaluated the impact of sociodemographic characteristics on cost of care in patients with obstructive HCM. These retrospective analyses included adults diagnosed with obstructive HCM from January 2013 to December 2021 using real-world data from Optum Market Clarity database. Among 5,129 patients identified with obstructive HCM, 52% were female, the mean age was 63.9 years, 77.6% were white and 40% were Medicare recipients. Compared to females, male patients had higher costs including overall total ($71,581 vs $63,710; p=0.014), medical ($70,395 vs $62,455; p=0.013), ambulatory ($16,024 vs $10,776; p<0.001), office visits ($1,906 vs $1,573; p<0.001) and outpatient visits ($14,118 vs $9,202; p<0.001). Compared to white patients, Black patients had significantly higher inpatient admissions costs ($54,572 vs $42,686; p=0.015), Hispanic patients had greater emergency room costs ($1,724 vs $791; p<0.001) and Asian patients had greater office costs ($2,094 vs $1,800; p<0.001). Patients aged 18-39 years had higher costs across all categories (p<0.001) compared to patients 40 or older, except inpatient admissions and prescriptions. Overall, these real-world analyses showed that, for patients with obstructive HCM, being a younger male was associated with increased healthcare costs, with additional differences in cost across race/ethnicity.\n\n**About**** _Aficamten_**\n\n_Aficamten_ is an investigational selective, small molecule cardiac myosin inhibitor discovered following an extensive chemical optimization program that was conducted with careful attention to therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic properties and as may translate into next-in-class potential in clinical development. _Aficamten_ was designed to reduce the number of active actin-myosin cross bridges during each cardiac cycle and consequently suppress the myocardial hypercontractility that is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In preclinical models, _aficamten_ reduced myocardial contractility by binding directly to cardiac myosin at a distinct and selective allosteric binding site, thereby preventing myosin from entering a force producing state.\n\nThe development program for _aficamten_ is assessing its potential as a treatment that improves exercise capacity and relieves symptoms in patients with HCM as well as its potential long-term effects on cardiac structure and function _. Aficamten_ was evaluated in SEQUOIA-HCM (**S** afety, **E** fficacy, and **Q** uantitative **U** nderstanding of **O** bstruction **I** mpact of **_A_** _ficamten_ in **HCM**), a positive pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). _Aficamten_ received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China. Cytokinetics submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA in Q3 2024 and expects to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Q4 2024.\n\n_Aficamten_ is also currently being evaluated in MAPLE-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ as monotherapy compared to metoprolol as monotherapy in patients with obstructive HCM, ACACIA-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ in patients with non-obstructive HCM, and CEDAR-HCM, a clinical trial of _aficamten_ in a pediatric population with obstructive HCM, and FOREST-HCM, an open-label extension clinical study of _aficamten_ in patients with HCM.\n\n**About Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease in which the heart muscle (myocardium) becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). The thickening of cardiac muscle leads to the inside of the left ventricle becoming smaller and stiffer, and thus the ventricle becomes less able to relax and fill with blood. This ultimately limits the heart’s pumping function, resulting in reduced exercise capacity and symptoms including chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or fainting during physical activity. HCM is the most common monogenic inherited cardiovascular disorder, with approximately 280,000 patients diagnosed, however, there are an estimated 400,000-800,000 additional patients who remain undiagnosed in the U.S.1,2,3 Two-thirds of patients with HCM have obstructive HCM (oHCM), where the thickening of the cardiac muscle leads to left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, while one-third have non-obstructive HCM (nHCM), where blood flow isn’t impacted, but the heart muscle is still thickened. People with HCM are at high risk of also developing cardiovascular complications including atrial fibrillation, stroke and mitral valve disease.4 People with HCM are at risk for potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias and it is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death in younger people or athletes.5 A subset of patients with HCM are at high risk of progressive disease leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure necessitating cardiac transplantation.\n\n**About Cytokinetics **\n\nCytokinetics is a late-stage, specialty cardiovascular biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing muscle biology-directed drug candidates as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which cardiac muscle performance is compromised. As a leader in muscle biology and the mechanics of muscle performance, the company is developing small molecule drug candidates specifically engineered to impact myocardial muscle function and contractility. Following positive results from SEQUOIA-HCM, the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating _aficamten,_ a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), Cytokinetics submitted an NDA for _aficamten_ to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration and is progressing regulatory submissions for _aficamten_ for the treatment of obstructive HCM in Europe. _Aficamten_ is also currently being evaluated in MAPLE-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ as monotherapy compared to metoprolol as monotherapy in patients with obstructive HCM, ACACIA-HCM, a Phase 3 clinical trial of _aficamten_ in patients with non-obstructive HCM, CEDAR-HCM, a clinical trial of _aficamten_ in a pediatric population with obstructive HCM, and FOREST-HCM, an open-label extension clinical study of _aficamten_ in patients with HCM. Cytokinetics is also developing _omecamtiv mecarbil_ , a cardiac muscle activator, in patients with heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), CK-586, a cardiac myosin inhibitor with a mechanism of action distinct from _aficamten_ for the potential treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and CK-089, a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (FSTA) for the potential treatment of a specific type of muscular dystrophy.\n\nFor additional information about Cytokinetics, visit [www.cytokinetics.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xrglu-U6t0tbZxj25Z8pclNbH2QLSxaDoLVwTTFrRusQwgpieXXVYpZWuGS-PVxBQdOPbzJYcMFB4gATZC1w9mXWKzjtGMuDoLMIqzIkoqg=) and follow us on [X](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=w3rzIXuL4sNn19NDb_NlCwdd4JD7-Dww1_wtHIgekI8vuXkNpEhFoT0mYlsiOvTCxB5hAp3SHbtfgm4lu9Fc2g==), [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=FG3WUtRaxck7JISSKZUgNjVKXoq1WljZP48jdtcWF_7gcrCetWJ_MgocqOn03jly79Qml4CMMK3xmdRsNGviGBVi9RM1EDqLuyogHY8rYQo=), [Facebook](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jcNGN7r8EbIH6l90GhC4EmNQflc7vhwJ2-ljVJOgrGuQIar5NAJ46i12Km8046w_oHnyXBiabkiluo-cmM5WBDkZUeI42NnpMcNZ1LGJjS4=) and [YouTube](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zupv2JaVLtO35Yjp5Z0iqm-bYTmoLziGLvlCWCv-pKKZS5URc90graMpQ2zP-lf8Au2dID6o9X901AG0jYhTDb4-WPC8ZtdR1qi-cJ7SdUDk_rmok4BbPXirudj5w5S5).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”).
