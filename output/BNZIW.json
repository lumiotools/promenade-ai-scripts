Banzai achieved a 31% annualized Annual Recurring Revenue growth rate and a historic record for Net Revenue Retention. We also made game-changing improvements to our balance sheet and cost structure to set us up for sustainable profitability in the future. Growth was driven by our focus on the Reach product through re-engineering and expanded sales efforts, leading to the addition of 1,785 customers through October 2024. In total, we now serve nearly 3,000 customers that have contributed to top and bottom-line sequential improvements from the second quarter.\n\n“To better serve our customers, we have continued to invest in our software platforms and growth. We’ve launched a new product, Curate, to bring AI-powered newsletters that leverage OpenAI’s GPT-4o to automate the newsletter creation process by writing relevant, branded articles that resonate with target audiences. We added significant enhancements to our Demio platform through deeper integration with Salesforce, the industry leading AI CRM company, with key enhancements designed to maximize efficiency and insight, offering marketers a more scalable, data-rich experience. We also released a major improvement to the Demio HubSpot integration. This upgrade offers unparalleled flexibility and efficiency in managing webinar data, empowering marketers to streamline their webinar management and marketing efforts, leading to better decision-making and higher ROI.\n\n“Alongside a $5.0 million private placement transaction and debt restructuring transactions we executed, we implemented a strategic initiative that we expect will enable us to significantly improve net income, substantially extend our cash runway and invest in growth. We are making significant progress on these goals and overall improvement in net income is expected to be approximately $12.2 million annually when fully implemented, while maintaining our growth outlook.\n\n“Looking ahead, our ability to leverage deep analytics and insights to drive marketing decisions combined with leveraging AI to launch exciting new products and capabilities, will continue to drive growth. We will continue to manage costs efficiently while investing in our software platform, sales and marketing and product development. We look forward to additional updates on our anticipated milestones in the weeks and months to come,” concluded Davy.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nBanzai believes its non-GAAP financial measure ARR is more meaningful in evaluating its performance.

The decrease was proportional to the revenue for the corresponding period.\n\nGross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.7 million, compared to $0.8 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin was 68.7% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 69.2% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $3.5 million, compared to $2.8 million in the prior year quarter.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $8.5 million, compared to $0.8 million in the prior year quarter. The greater net loss is primarily due to the change in fair valuation of various financial instruments related to the debt restructuring in the third quarter of 2024, which increased by approximately $14.5 million over the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. These non-cash valuation charges do not represent present or future cash obligations of the Company, and as a result, the Company believes Adjusted Net Loss is a better representation of the financial performance of the company for the third quarter 2024.\n\nAdjusted Net Loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was ($1.45) million, compared to ($3.6) million in the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven by improvements to the Company’s efficiency and by write-off agreements entered into for certain liabilities, substantially reducing the Company’s current and future cash liabilities.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA Loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was ($1.5) million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA Loss of ($2.0) million for the prior year quarter, representing an improvement of $0.5 million.\n\n**Nine Month 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $3.2 million and $3.5 million, respectively, a decrease of 7.2%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower Reach revenue which declined by approximately $44 thousand due to the discontinuation of the legacy Reach 1.0 product, which was discontinued on December 31, 2023. In 2024, Banzai has revitalized its focus on the Reach product through re-engineering and expanded sales efforts. Demio revenue was lower by approximately $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower new unit sales period-over-period, due to the company’s strategic shift to focus on mid-market customers, which the Company hopes will ultimately result in higher Average Customer Value and Net Retention Rate for the Demio product. Demio Net Revenue Retention reached an all-time historic high in the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nCost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively. This represents a decrease of approximately $84 thousand, or approximately 7.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is due primarily to the company’s focus on Mid-Market customers that led to an approximately 12% higher average cost per customer, driven by the increase in the streaming services costs of approximately $150 thousand that were offset by lower infrastructure costs / data licenses of approximately $117 thousand, payroll and contracted services of approximately $98 thousand, and merchant fee costs of approximately $12 thousand.\n\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $2.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively. This represents a decrease of approximately $167 thousand, or approximately 7.1%, which was due to the decreases in revenue of approximately $251 thousand and decreases in cost of revenue of approximately $84 thousand described above. Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 67.5% and 67.4%, respectively.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were $11.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively, an increase of 31.1%. This increase was due primarily to an overall increase in salaries and related expenses by approximately $0.3 million, marketing expenses by approximately $0.6 million, costs associated with audit, technical accounting, and legal and other professional services of approximately $1.6 million. The company has implemented a plan to reduce annualized operating expenses by up to $13.5 million by the end of the first quarter 2025.\n\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $23.7 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The greater net loss is primarily due to an increase in total other expenses of approximately $12.6 million, an increase in operating expenses of approximately $2.8 million, and a decrease in gross profit of approximately $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nAdjusted Net Loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was ($10.0)\n\nmillion and ($10.0) million, respectively.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $11.9 million, compared to $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nCash totaled $4.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $2.1 million as of December 31, 2023, representing a historic high.\n\n**End-of-Year 2024 Target**\n\nBanzai targets December 2024 ARR to be $8.1 – $10 million, based on the Company’s March 2024 ARR, organic growth during the year as demonstrated by year-to-date 2024 customer wins and reactivations, and currently signed non-binding LOIs to acquire other marketing technology businesses.\n\nThe midpoint target, or $9.1 million, foresees a 97% increase in ARR, which would be attributable to both organic growth and the acquisitions currently under LOI. Banzai’s management anticipates tracking the Company’s progress to its targeted December 2024 ARR as part of the Company’s 2024 quarterly earnings reports.\n\nAnnual recurring revenue refers to revenue, normalized on an annual basis, that Banzai expects to receive from its customers for providing them with products or services. The December 2024 ARR information provided above is based on Banzai’s current estimates of internal growth, the completion of acquisitions, and those companies contributing ARR based on current levels, and is not a guarantee of future performance. These statements are forward-looking and actual ARR may differ materially. Refer to the “Forward-Looking Statements” section below for information on the factors that could cause Banzai’s actual ARR to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call**\n\nBanzai Founder & CEO Joe Davy and Interim CFO Alvin Yip will host the conference call, followed by a question-and-answer session.

Forward-looking statements often use words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “target,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should,” “would,” “propose,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “predict,” “potential,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,” and similar variations and expressions. Forward-looking statements are those that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Examples of forward-looking statements may include, among others, statements regarding Banzai International, Inc.’s (the “Company’s”): future financial, business and operating performance and goals; annualized recurring revenue and customer retention; ongoing, future or ability to maintain or improve its financial position, cash flows, and liquidity and its expected financial needs; potential financing and ability to obtain financing; acquisition strategy and proposed acquisitions and, if completed, their potential success and financial contributions; strategy and strategic goals, including being able to capitalize on opportunities; expectations relating to the Company’s industry, outlook and market trends; total addressable market and serviceable addressable market and related projections; plans, strategies and expectations for retaining existing or acquiring new customers, increasing revenue and executing growth initiatives; and product areas of focus and additional products that may be sold in the future.

Companies using Reach 2.0 include Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), a Fortune 500 communications and security technology company; The Economist Impact, which offers partnership solutions combining think-tank rigor, media brand creativity and global influence to catalyze growth and change in the world; and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), a fast-growing cloud security software company.\n\n\n\nBanzai has agreed with Yorkville that upon repayment of $2 million outstanding under the Yorkville Promissory Notes, Yorkville will not deliver any Investor Notice under the SEPA and will not exercise its right to convert the remainder of the $0.7 million or less outstanding under the Yorkville Promissory Notes for a period of 90 days following such repayment. Repayment of the Yorkville Promissory Notes will be conditioned upon completion of a Banzai registered offering.\n\n“Q1 was a strong rebuilding quarter for Banzai compared to Q4 2023. Our positive quarterly growth was driven by improvements to both our Demio product and our customer acquisition efficiency. We are excited about the transformative potential of our new Reach 2.0 product and the new customers we’ve added so far in 2024,” said Joe Davy, CEO of Banzai. “We have many new, exciting product releases coming in 2024 as Banzai continues to leverage AI and data to deliver solutions that give marketers superpowers.”\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nBanzai believes its non-GAAP financial measure ARR is more meaningful in evaluating its performance. The Company’s management team evaluates its financial and operating results utilizing this non-GAAP measure.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, Banzai reported **total revenue** of approximately $1,079 thousand, representing a decrease of approximately $98 thousand, or approximately 8.3%, compared to the three months for the same period ended March 31, 2023. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower Reach revenue which declined by approximately $74 thousand due to a shift in Banzai's focus to its Demio product and decision, which decision was reversed in 2024, to begin phasing out the Reach product. In 2024 Banzai is revitalizing its focus on the Reach product through re-engineering and expanded sales efforts. Demio revenue was lower by approximately $25 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to churn and lower new sales period-over-period.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, Banzai’s **cost of revenue** totaled approximately $381 thousand and approximately $412 thousand, respectively. This represents a decrease of approximately $31 thousand, or approximately 7.5%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, is due primarily to lower customer base and an approximately 4% lower average cost per customer, driven by lower infrastructure costs of approximately $45 thousand, contracted services of approximately $34 thousand, subscription payroll of approximately $14 thousand, and merchant fee costs of approximately $3 thousand. The lower contracted services and data licenses cost described above were offset by the increase of the streaming services costs of approximately $65 thousand.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, Banzai’s **gross profit** was approximately $698 thousand and approximately $765 thousand, respectively. This represents a decrease of approximately $67 thousand, or approximately 8.8% due to the decreases in revenue of approximately $98 thousand and decreases in cost of revenue of approximately $31 thousand described above.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, Banzai reported **net losses** of approximately $4.5 million and approximately $3.8 million, respectively. The greater net loss is primarily due to a reduction in total other expenses of approximately $0.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $1.1 million and a decrease in gross profit of approximately $0.1 million.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, Banzai’s **Adjusted EBITDA Loss** was approximately $1,508 thousand, reflecting a decrease in the earnings of approximately $882 thousand compared to a loss of approximately $626 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This period-over-period decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense – related party and transaction related expenses.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Banzai had cash of approximately $1.0 million.\n\n**End-of-Year 2024 Target**\n\nBanzai targets December 2024 ARR to be $8.1 – $10 million, based on the Company’s March 2024 ARR, organic growth during the year as demonstrated by year-to-date 2024 customer wins and reactivations, and currently signed non-binding LOIs to acquire Cliently and Boast. The targeted December 2024 ARR does not include any additional intended acquisitions.\n\nThe midpoint target, or $9.1 million, foresees a 97% increase in ARR, which would be equally attributable to organic growth and the acquisitions currently under LOI. Banzai’s management anticipates tracking the Company’s progress to its targeted December 2024 ARR as part of the Company’s 2024 quarterly earnings reports.\n\nAnnual recurring revenue refers to revenue, normalized on an annual basis, that Banzai expects to receive from its customers for providing them with products or services. The December 2024 ARR information provided above is based on Banzai’s current estimates of internal growth, the completion of the Cliently and Boast acquisitions and those companies contributing ARR based on current levels and is not a guarantee of future performance. These statements are forward-looking and actual ARR may differ materially. Refer to the “Forward-Looking Statements” section below for information on the factors that could cause Banzai’s actual ARR to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\n**About Banzai**\n\nBanzai is a marketing technology company that provides essential marketing and sales solutions for businesses of all sizes.

Forward-looking statements often use words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “target,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “should,” “would,” “propose,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “predict,” “potential,” “seek,” “future,” “outlook,” and similar variations and expressions. Forward-looking statements are those that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Examples of forward-looking statements may include, among others, statements regarding the Company’s: future financial, business and operating performance and goals; annualized recurring revenue and customer retention; ongoing, future or ability to maintain or improve its financial position, cash flows, and liquidity and its expected financial needs; potential financing and ability to obtain financing; acquisition strategy, including the Company’s expectations regarding market conditions and available opportunities, the Company’s ability to execute on such strategy and the expected benefits of such strategy; proposed acquisitions and, if completed, their potential success and financial contributions; strategy and strategic goals, including being able to capitalize on opportunities; the Company’s expectation regarding amendment of the Yorkville Promissory Notes, which is conditioned on repayment of a portion of such notes in connection with a registered offering; expectations relating to the Company’s industry, outlook and market trends; total addressable market and serviceable addressable market and related projections; plans, strategies and expectations for retaining existing or acquiring new customers, increasing revenue and executing growth initiatives; and product areas of focus and additional products that may be sold in the future.\n\nBecause forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and development of the industry in which the Company operates may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Therefore, investors should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially include the Company’s ability to repay a portion of the Yorkville Promissory Notes, changes in the markets in which the Company operates, customer demand, the financial markets, economic, business and regulatory and other factors, such as the Company’s ability to execute on its strategy, its assumptions regarding available and serviceable markets, its ability to realize some or all of the expected benefits of its acquisition strategy and its ability to effectively integrate the businesses or technologies it acquires, if any. More detailed information about risk factors can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors,” and in other reports filed by the Company, including reports on Form 8-K. The Company does not undertake any duty to update forward-looking statements after the date they are made.\n\nThis release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.\n\n**Contacts:**\n\n**Investors** Ralf EsperGateway Group949-574-3860[bnzi@gateway-grp.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cguYcgaM7wF3U3hSdh1vFy9W9I4Yr4BAiU_g7bAuCVzW8id-b-t4L1DoeXf1SC0a3T72-7YOkpe_32NrWmUAbkpfmpSNHFUr2IUTfQ7F55o=)\n\n**Media** Tori KlimczakBLASTmedia317-806-1900 ext [banzai@blastmedia.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OcDuaB69CcnRsUjFGtgW21YG1ZbONJ8dU0eCMwJsNRIpcnlgSql5L89fn6yHdrbxewriKqyXI1y6LPPzXlBfG_an_sFTyRrF7B6bPc0fxV4=)\n\n**Banzai International, Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n---  \n**March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash| $| 1,026,932| $| 2,093,718  \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $3,557 and $5,748, respectively| 34,670| 105,049  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets| 1,073,914| 741,155  \nTotal current assets| 2,135,516| 2,939,922  \nProperty and equipment, net| 3,080| 4,644  \nGoodwill| 2,171,526| 2,171,526  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| 90,308| 134,013  \nOther assets| 38,381| 38,381  \nTotal assets| 4,438,811| 5,288,486  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| 8,336,909| 6,439,863  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities| 3,862,714| 5,194,240  \nConvertible notes (Yorkville)| 3,064,000| 1,766,000  \nConvertible notes – related party| —| 2,540,091  \nConvertible notes| 3,709,889| 2,693,841  \nNotes payable| 6,948,710| 6,659,787  \nNotes payable – related party| 3,082,650| 2,505,137  \nDeferred underwriting fees| 4,000,000| 4,000,000  \nDeferred fee| —| 500,000  \nWarrant liability| 233,000| 641,000  \nWarrant liability – related party| 460,000| 575,000  \nEarnout liability| 37,125| 59,399  \nDue to related party| 67,118| 67,118  \nGEM commitment fee liability| —| 2,000,000  \nDeferred revenue| 1,245,306| 1,214,096  \nOperating lease liabilities, current| 158,965| 234,043  \nTotal current liabilities| 35,206,386| 37,089,615  \nOther long-term liabilities| 75,000| 75,000  \nTotal liabilities| 35,281,386| 37,164,615  \nStockholders' deficit:  \nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value, 275,000,000 shares authorized and 20,221,589 and 16,019,256 issued and outstanding at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively (Note 15)| 2,022| 1,602  \nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value, 75,000,000 shares authorized, 0 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023| —| —  \nAdditional paid-in capital| 20,421,999| 14,888,593  \nAccumulated deficit| (51,266,596| )| (46,766,324| )  \nTotal stockholders' deficit| (30,842,575| )| (31,876,129| )  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders' deficit| $| 4,438,811| $| 5,288,486  \n  \n**Banzai International, Inc.****Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations**  \n---  \n**For the Three MonthsEnded March 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nOperating income:  \nRevenue| $| 1,079,472| $| 1,177,061  \nCost of revenue| 381,380| 412,226  \nGross profit| 698,092| 764,835  \nOperating expenses:  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 4,308,929| 3,170,063  \nDepreciation expense| 1,564| 2,404  \nTotal operating expenses| 4,310,493| 3,172,467  \nOperating loss| (3,612,401| )| (2,407,632| )  \nOther expenses (income):  \nGEM settlement fee expense| 200,000| —  \nOther income, net| (4,118| )| (62,538| )  \nInterest income| (10| )| (111| )  \nInterest expense| 451,399| 537,878  \nInterest expense – related party| 577,513| 383,284  \nGain on extinguishment of liability| (527,980| )| —  \nLoss on debt issuance| 171,000| —  \nChange in fair value of warrant liability| (408,000| )| —  \nChange in fair value of warrant liability – related party| (115,000| )| —  \nChange in fair value of simple agreement for future equity| —| 22,861  \nChange in fair value of simple agreement for future equity – related party| —| 303,139  \nChange in fair value of bifurcated embedded derivative liabilities| —| 32,415  \nChange in fair value of bifurcated embedded derivative liabilities – related party| —| 137,285  \nChange in fair value of convertible notes| 544,000| —  \nTotal other expenses, net| 888,804| 1,354,213  \nLoss before income taxes| (4,501,205| )| (3,761,845| )  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense| (933| )| 3,277  \nNet loss| $| (4,500,272| )| $| (3,765,122| )  \nNet loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| $| (0.26| )| $| (0.59| )  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding  \nBasic and diluted| 17,355,609| 6,382,180  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZGJhN2YyODUtMjllNi00NDhhLWFiZjUtZWM1MGUwZWQ4YzQ2LTEyNzUyNzc=/tiny/Banzai-International-Inc-.png)\n"
