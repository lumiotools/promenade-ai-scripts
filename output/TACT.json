The Company has engaged in preliminary discussions with potential strategic partners. Additionally, the Board of Directors has formed an independent committee to consider the full range of strategic, operational, and financial alternatives in order to maximize stockholder value, which may include a potential sale of part of or the entire business of the Company and the development and implementation of new strategies designed to grow the Company’s business. \n\n“TransAct’s casino business remains a market leader with growth prospects existing globally. As inventories in the industry normalize, we fully expect the business to continue to produce stable and growing returns,” said John Dillon, Chief Executive Officer of TransAct. “The FST business, despite the loss of 7-Eleven’s label business, is growing. We have added a number of new customers with significant growth opportunities and, in addition, a large global QSR client has successfully procured more than 1,000 units of our new BOHA! Terminal 2 since the beginning of this year.” \n\n“While we focus externally on strategic initiatives, we will continue to prioritize internal initiatives that improve and refine operational execution within each functional area of the business,” continued Mr. Dillon. \n\n**About TransAct Technologies Incorporated**\n\nTransAct Technologies Incorporated is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high-growth markets including food service, casino and gaming, and POS automation.

Terminal sales. We believe this momentum is just the beginning, with the effects of our re-organization and re-focusing of the sales team and go-to-market process starting to yield positive results,” said John Dillon, Chief Executive Officer of TransAct. “We also added another 12 new FST accounts in the quarter, representing approximately 2,400 potential Terminal 2 sales opportunities. Our pipeline continues to hold strong under continued scrubbing, and as we further refine our process, we expect to further improve our go-to-market execution and generate improving conversion rates in 2025.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Net Sales** : Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 were $10.9 million, down 6% sequentially and down 37% compared to $17.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, largely as a result of the expected market dynamics and normalizing demand for our Casino and Gaming printers. \n  * **FST Recurring Revenue** : FST recurring revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.9 million, which was up 4% sequentially, but down 8% compared to $3.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **Gross Profit** : Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.2 million, resulting in gross margin of 48.1%, compared to gross profit of $8.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, which delivered a 51.9% gross margin. \n  * **Operating (loss) income:** Operating loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $(837) thousand, compared to an operating loss of $(438) thousand for the second quarter of 2024 and operating income of $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **Net (loss) income:** Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $(551) thousand, or $(0.06) per diluted share, based on 10.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding, compared sequentially to a net loss for the second quarter of 2024 of $(319) thousand, or $(0.03) per diluted share. This compares to net income for the third quarter of 2023 of $906 thousand, or $0.09 per diluted share, based on 10.1 million weighted average common shares outstanding. \n  * **EBITDA:** EBITDA was negative $(533) thousand for the third quarter of 2024, compared to negative $(190) thousand for the second quarter of 2024 and $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** : Adjusted EBITDA was negative $(204) thousand for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $89 thousand in the second quarter of 2024, and $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\n**Updated 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\n  * **Net Sales** : The Company now expects full year 2024 net sales of between $43 million and $45 million. \n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** : The Company continues to expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $1 million and negative $2 million\n\n\n\nOur outlook for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is presented only on a non-GAAP basis because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is available without unreasonable effort, primarily due to uncertainties relating to the occurrence or amount of these adjustments that may arise in the future. If one or more of the currently unavailable items is applicable, some items could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to GAAP reported results. \n\n**Strategic Business Review**\n\nThe Company continues to actively assess strategic alternatives with the assistance of Roth Capital Partners, LLC, the Company’s advisor while continuing to pursue its business growth and development initiatives on a parallel track. The Company has engaged with a number of outside parties since the previous update in June and is in various stages of discussion with such outside parties. The Company is committed to pursuing an optimal outcome for all its stakeholders and maximizing shareholder value. \n\n**2024 Third Quarter Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nTransAct is hosting a conference call and webcast today, November 7, 2024, beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the Company’s preliminary third quarter 2024 results and other matters. Both the call and the webcast are open to the general public. The conference call number is 877-704-4453 and the conference ID number is 13749888. Please call ten minutes prior to the presentation to ensure that you are connected. \n\nInterested parties may also access the conference call live on the Internet at [www.transact-tech.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.transact-tech.com&esheet=54148961&newsitemid=20241107947672&lan=en-US&anchor=www.transact-tech.com&index=1&md5=2763e831d8ce8071eac257869777091a) (select “Company” followed by “Investor Relations,” then select “News & Events” followed by “Events & Presentations”). Approximately two hours after the call has concluded, an archived version of the webcast will be available for replay at the same location. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTransAct is providing certain non-GAAP financial measures because the Company believes that these measures are helpful to investors and others in assessing the ongoing nature of what the Company’s management views as TransAct’s core operations. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide the Company with an understanding of one aspect of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide relevant and useful information to an investor evaluating the Company’s operating performance because these measures are: (i) widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items that do not reflect the Company’s ongoing operations and are excluded from the calculation of such measures; (ii) used as financial measurements by lenders and other parties to evaluate creditworthiness; and (iii) used by the Company’s management for various purposes including strategic planning and forecasting and assessing financial performance. Adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per diluted share provide the Company with an understanding of the results of the primary operations of the business by excluding the effects of special items (for example, the $1.5 million severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former CEO in the first nine months of 2023) that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s operations. The Company uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period operating performance because the Company believes this provides a more comparable measure of the Company’s continuing business, as these measures adjust for the special items that are not reflective of the normal results of the business. The presentation of this non-GAAP information is not considered superior to or a substitute for, and should be read in conjunction with, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nEBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before net interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before net interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and is adjusted for (1) share-based compensation expense, (2) the $1.5 million severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former CEO in the first nine months of 2023 and (3) any other items, when they occur, that we believe do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s ongoing business. The Company adjusts EBITDA for share-based compensation because the Company considers share-based compensation expense to be a non-cash expense similar to depreciation and amortization. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. \n\nAdjusted net (loss) income is defined as net (loss) income adjusted for the $1.5 million severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former CEO in the first nine months of 2023. A reconciliation of adjusted net (loss) income to net (loss) income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. \n\nAdjusted net (loss) income per diluted share is defined as adjusted net (loss) income divided by diluted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of adjusted net (loss) income per diluted share to net (loss) income per diluted share, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. \n\n**About TransAct Technologies Incorporated**\n\nTransAct Technologies Incorporated is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high-growth markets including food service, casino and gaming, and POS automation.

(OTCQX: TBTC), a developer and provider of casino information and management systems, along with TransAct Technologies Incorporated (Nasdaq: TACT) (“TransAct”), a global leader in software-driven technology and printing solutions, today shared the results from the first six months of the SlotSUITE deployment. This floor-wide, single-wire printing solution, announced in December 2023, was recently implemented in a large regional casino in the American Southwest. \n\nSlotSUITE was developed through a partnership between CasinoTrac and TransAct Technologies. It integrates TransAct’s Epicentral SE with PromoTrac, CasinoTrac’s unified promotions administration and management system, using a single-wire solution that works on existing CasinoTrac gaming floor networks. This integration eliminates the need for additional network wiring and peripherals, making it a practical option for casinos looking to streamline operations and enhance player engagement. TransAct’s Epicentral SE solution allows SlotSUITE to print promotions live at the slot machine during play. \n\n**Deployment Results**\n\nThe SlotSUITE system was installed across more than 2,500 games and compared against data from the previous twelve months. The results from this initial deployment indicate significant improvements in several key performance areas: \n\n  * **Carded/Rated Play:** An increase of 58.6% was observed, with average rated play rising from 17% to 29% over the six-month period. \n  * **Rated Coin-In:** There was a 21% increase in rated coin-in on the games upgraded with SlotSUITE. \n  * **Overall Coin-In:** A 3% increase in coin-in and related win was seen across the entire floor, including games still needing to be upgraded. \n  * **Rated WPU Increase:** Rated WPU increased by 39% among games enhanced with SlotSUITE. \n  * **Overall WPU:** A significant 8% increase in WPU was recorded across the entire gaming floor, even in games not yet upgraded to SlotSUITE. \n\n\n\nChad Hoehne, President of Table Trac, commented, “The SlotSUITE deployment has confirmed our expectations of a solution that is not only simple to deploy but also effective in improving operational efficiency and guest experience. The results show a clear impact on profitability and player engagement.” \n\nJohn Dillon, CEO of TransAct, added, “The data from this deployment reinforces the value of SlotSUITE as a solution that can simplify casino operations while delivering measurable financial benefits. We’re pleased with the early success and look forward to further implementations.” \n\nAs SlotSUITE continues to be deployed in other locations, both CasinoTrac and TransAct are optimistic about its potential to support casino operators in improving their overall floor performance and enhancing the player experience. \n\n**About Table Trac, Inc. **Founded in 1995, Table Trac, Inc. designs, develops and sells CasinoTrac CMS, a casino management system, and complementary operations, analytical software for gaming and hospitality operators.

Our initiatives aimed at streamlining the organization and increasing our sales efficiency are producing positive changes at TransAct and we are continuing to work diligently towards our goals.” \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Net Sales** : Net sales for the second quarter of 2024 were $11.6 million, up 9% sequentially, but down 42% compared to $19.9 million for the second quarter of 2023, largely as a result of the expected market dynamics and normalizing demand for our Casino and Gaming printers. \n  * **FST Recurring Revenue** : FST recurring revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $2.8 million, which was up 15% sequentially, and up 12% compared to $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n  * **Gross Profit** : Gross profit for the second quarter of 2024 was $6.1 million, resulting in gross margin of 52.7%, compared to gross profit of $10.9 million for the second quarter of 2023, which delivered a 54.5% gross margin. \n  * **Operating (loss) income:** Operating loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $(438) thousand, compared to an operating loss of $(1.3) million for the first quarter of 2024 and operating income of $1.2 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n  * **Net (loss) income:** Net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $(319) thousand, or $(0.03) per diluted share, based on 10.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding. Net loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $(1.0) million, or $(0.10) per diluted share, and net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $765 thousand, or $0.08 per diluted share, based on 10.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding. \n  * **Adjusted net (loss) income:** Adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $(319) thousand, or $(0.03) per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the comparable 2023 period was $2.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. \n  * **EBITDA:** EBITDA was negative $190 thousand for the second quarter of 2024, compared to negative $966 thousand for the first quarter of 2024 and $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** : Adjusted EBITDA was $89 thousand for the second quarter of 2024, compared to negative $701 thousand in the first quarter of 2024, and $3.2 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\n**Updated 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\n  * **Total Net Sales**: The Company currently expects full year 2024 total net sales of between $45 million and $50 million. \n  * **Total Adjusted EBITDA** : The Company expects full year 2024 total adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $1 million and negative $2 million, up from the previously anticipated range of negative $2.5 million to negative $3.5 million. \n\n\n\nOur outlook for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is presented only on a non-GAAP basis because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is available without unreasonable effort, primarily due to uncertainties relating to the occurrence or amount of these adjustments that may arise in the future. If one or more of the currently unavailable items is applicable, some items could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to GAAP reported results. \n\n**Strategic Business Review**\n\nThe Company continues to actively assess strategic alternatives with the assistance of Roth Capital Partners, LLC, the Company’s advisor while continuing to pursue its business growth and development initiatives on a parallel track. The Company has engaged with a number of outside parties since the previous update in June and is in various stages of discussion with such outside parties. The Company is committed to pursuing an optimal outcome for all its stakeholders and maximizing shareholder value. \n\n**2024 Second Quarter Conference Call and Webcast** TransAct is hosting a conference call and webcast today, August 8, 2024, beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the Company’s preliminary second quarter 2024 results and other matters. Both the call and the webcast are open to the general public. The conference call number is 877-704-4453 and the conference ID number is 13747979. Please call ten minutes prior to the presentation to ensure that you are connected. \n\nInterested parties may also access the conference call live on the Internet at [www.transact-tech.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.transact-tech.com&esheet=54106543&newsitemid=20240808882198&lan=en-US&anchor=www.transact-tech.com&index=1&md5=7f878ee077dbc41cf2a32172d4a2f047) (select “Company” followed by “Investor Relations,” then select “News & Events” followed by “Events & Presentations”). Approximately two hours after the call has concluded, an archived version of the webcast will be available for replay at the same location. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** TransAct is providing certain non-GAAP financial measures because the Company believes that these measures are helpful to investors and others in assessing the ongoing nature of what the Company’s management views as TransAct’s core operations. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide the Company with an understanding of one aspect of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide relevant and useful information to an investor evaluating the Company’s operating performance because these measures are: (i) widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items that do not reflect the Company’s ongoing operations and are excluded from the calculation of such measures; (ii) used as financial measurements by lenders and other parties to evaluate creditworthiness; and (iii) used by the Company’s management for various purposes including strategic planning and forecasting and assessing financial performance. Adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per diluted share provide the Company with an understanding of the results of the primary operations of the business by excluding the effects of special items (for example, the $1.5 million severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former CEO in the second quarter of 2023) that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s operations. The Company uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period operating performance because the Company believes this provides a more comparable measure of the Company’s continuing business, as these measures adjust for the special items that are not reflective of the normal results of the business. The presentation of this non-GAAP information is not considered superior to or a substitute for, and should be read in conjunction with, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nEBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before net interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before net interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and is adjusted for (1) share-based compensation, (2) the $1.5 million severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former CEO in the second quarter of 2023 and (3) any other items, when they occur, that we believe do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s ongoing business. The Company adjusts EBITDA for share-based compensation because the Company considers share-based compensation to be a non-cash expense similar to depreciation and amortization. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. \n\nAdjusted net (loss) income is defined as net (loss) income adjusted for the $1.5 million severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former CEO in the second quarter of 2023. A reconciliation of adjusted net (loss) income to net (loss) income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. \n\nAdjusted net (loss) income per diluted share is defined as adjusted net (loss) income divided by diluted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of adjusted net (loss) income per diluted share to net (loss) income per diluted share, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. \n\n**About TransAct Technologies Incorporated **TransAct Technologies Incorporated is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high-growth markets including food service, casino and gaming, and POS automation.
