Robust end market demand along with contributions from operational excellence fueled significant sales growth and earnings expansion,” said Chip Blankenship, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In Aerospace, both commercial and defense OEM sales increased due to capacity improvements to meet customer demand, and commercial and defense aftermarket sales increased due to continued high aircraft utilization. Our Industrial business benefitted from increased sales in power generation and transportation. Our performance over the last year reflects the hard work and dedication of Woodward members to deliver on our value proposition and fulfill our purpose.\n\nWe enter fiscal 2025 with strong momentum.

The product rationalization adjustment pertains to a non-recurring write-off of inventory and assets related to the elimination of certain product lines. The specific charge for excess and obsolete inventory pertains to a non-recurring process change that resulted in the identification and write down of certain excess inventory unrelated to product rationalization. The non-recurring charge related to customer collections pertains to a discrete process issue that was identified and corrected. The Company believes that these excluded items are short‐term in nature, not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business, and therefore, the exclusion of them illustrates more clearly how the underlying business of Woodward is performing. Adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow (defined below) minus cash received for a non-recurring matter related to a previous acquisition, plus cash paid for (i) business development activities, (ii) a non-recurring matter unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business, (iii) certain non-restructuring separation costs and (iv) restructuring charges. Management believes these adjustments to free cash flow better portray Woodward’s operating performance.\n\nEBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted effective tax rate, and adjusted nonsegment expenses are financial measures not prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Management uses EBIT and adjusted EBIT to evaluate Woodward’s operating performance without the impacts of financing and tax related considerations. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in evaluating Woodward’s operating performance, making business decisions, including developing budgets, managing expenditures, forecasting future periods, and evaluating capital structure impacts of various strategic scenarios. Management also uses free cash flow, which is derived from net cash provided by or used in operating activities less payments for property, plant, and equipment, as well as adjusted free cash flow (as described above), in reviewing the financial performance of Woodward’s various business segments and evaluating cash generation levels. Securities analysts, investors, and others frequently use EBIT, EBITDA and free cash flow in their evaluation of companies, particularly those with significant property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets that are subject to amortization. The use of any of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted EBITDA exclude certain financial information compared with net earnings, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the information that is excluded. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Woodward’s calculations of EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted nonsegment expenses, free cash flow, and adjusted free cash flow may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n2Website, Facebook, X: Woodward has used, and intends to continue to use, its Investor Relations website, LinkedIn page, Facebook page, and X handle as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\nContact:| Dan Provaznik Director, Investor Relations 970-498-3849 Dan.Provaznik@woodward.com  \n---|---  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI4OTc5NCM2NjEwMjEwIzIwMDU3MTY=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NzBhYjI1YTQtYTNmNC00OTk4LWFiMmUtYWVjMWMwNTA2YzRiLTEwMTcyODk=/tiny/Woodward-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/3044afab-2c3e-490d-83db-e461a429c66c/small/w-logo-rgb-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3044afab-2c3e-490d-83db-e461a429c66c)\n\nSource: Woodward, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://woodward2024rd.q4web.com/news/default.aspx)\n"

The product rationalization adjustment pertains to a non-\nrecurring write-off of inventory and assets related to the elimination of certain product lines. The specific charge\nfor excess and obsolete inventory pertains to a non-recurring process change that resulted in the identification and\nwrite down of certain excess inventory unrelated to product rationalization. The non-recurring charge related to\ncustomer collections pertains to a discrete process issue that was identified and corrected. The Company believes\nthat these excluded items are short‐term in nature, not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business,\nand therefore, the exclusion of them illustrates more clearly how the underlying business of Woodward is\nperforming. Adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow (defined below) minus cash received for a non-recurring\nmatter related to a previous acquisition, plus cash paid for (i) business development activities, (ii) a non-recurring\nmatter unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business, (iii) certain non-restructuring separation costs and (iv)\nrestructuring charges. Management believes these adjustments to free cash flow better portray Woodward’s\noperating performance.\nEBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization),\nfree cash flow, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBIT, adjusted\nEBITDA, adjusted effective tax rate, and adjusted nonsegment expenses are financial measures not prepared and\npresented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.\nGAAP). Management uses EBIT and adjusted EBIT to evaluate Woodward’s operating performance without the\nimpacts of financing and tax related considerations. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in evaluating\nWoodward’s operating performance, making business decisions, including developing budgets, managing\nexpenditures, forecasting future periods, and evaluating capital structure impacts of various strategic scenarios.\nManagement also uses free cash flow, which is derived from net cash provided by or used in operating activities\nless payments for property, plant, and equipment, as well as adjusted free cash flow (as described above), in\nreviewing the financial performance of Woodward’s various business segments and evaluating cash generation\nlevels. Securities analysts, investors, and others frequently use EBIT, EBITDA and free cash flow in their evaluation\nof companies, particularly those with significant property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets that are\nsubject to amortization. The use of any of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be\nconsidered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. Because adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBIT, and\nadjusted EBITDA exclude certain financial information compared with net earnings, the most comparable U.S.\nGAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the information that is excluded. Free\ncash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not\nnecessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Woodward’s calculations of EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted net\nearnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted\nnonsegment expenses, free cash flow, and adjusted free cash flow may differ from similarly titled measures used\nby other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n2Website, Facebook, X: Woodward has used, and intends to continue to use, its Investor Relations website,\nLinkedIn page, Facebook page, and X handle as means of disclosing material non-public information and for\ncomplying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n-end-"

Compe\u0000\u0000ve success is based on the development of\ninnova\u0000ve components and systems that are aligned with the OEMs’ technology roadmaps to achieve future reliability, emission, efficiency, and fuel flexibility\ntargets.\nFor addi\u0000onal informa\u0000on about our markets and trends in our markets, please see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondi\u0000on and Results of Opera\u0000ons.\nGovernment Contracts and Regula\u0000on\nPor\u0000ons of our business, par\u0000cularly in our Aerospace segment, are heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and\nen\u0000\u0000es, including all of the branches of the U.S. military, the Na\u0000onal Aeronau\u0000cs and Space Administra\u0000on (“NASA”), and the Departments of Defense,\nHomeland Security, and Transporta\u0000on. We also contract with similar government authori\u0000es outside the United States, subject in all cases to applicable law.\nWe must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regula\u0000ons rela\u0000ng to the forma\u0000on, administra\u0000on, and performance of U.S. Government\ncontracts. These laws and regula\u0000ons, among other things:\n• require accurate, complete, and current disclosure and cer\u0000fica\u0000on of cost and pricing data in connec\u0000on with certain contracts;\n• impose specific and unique cost accoun\u0000ng prac\u0000ces that may differ from accoun\u0000ng principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.\nGAAP”), and therefore require robust systems to reconcile;\n• impose regula\u0000ons that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S.\nGovernment contracts;\n4\n• impose manufacturing specifica\u0000ons and other quality standards that may be more restric\u0000ve than for non-government business ac\u0000vi\u0000es; and\n• restrict the use and dissemina\u0000on of informa\u0000on classified for na\u0000onal security purposes due to the regula\u0000ons of the U.S. Government and\nforeign governments pertaining to the export of certain products and technical data.\nSales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and en\u0000\u0000es, or indirectly through third party manufacturers u\u0000lizing our parts and subassemblies,\ncollec\u0000vely represented 17% of our sales for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our sales, in total or in either reportable segment, are not subject to significant seasonal varia\u0000on. However, our sales have generally been\nlower in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to the immediately preceding quarter due to fewer working days resul\u0000ng from the observance of\nvarious holidays and scheduled plant shutdowns for annual maintenance.\nSales Order Backlog\nFor each of our reportable segments, we have elected to quan\u0000fy backlog in a manner consistent with the defini\u0000on of remaining performance\nobliga\u0000ons. Our remaining performance obliga\u0000ons by segment, excluding material rights, is shown in the table below:\nPercent Expected to Percent Expected to\nbe sa\u0000sfied by be sa\u0000sfied by\nOctober 31, 2024 September 30, 2025 October 31, 2023 September 30, 2024\nAerospace $ 2,240,597 55% $ 1,716,613 63%\nIndustrial 662,750 85% 773,240 93%\n$ 2,903,347 62% $ 2,489,853 73%\nOur remaining performance obliga\u0000ons relate to the aggregate amount of the total contract transac\u0000on price of firm orders for which the performance\nobliga\u0000on has not yet been recognized in revenue.\nManufacturing\nWe operate manufacturing and assembly plants primarily in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Our products consist of mechanical, electronic, and\nelectromechanical systems and components.\nAluminum, iron, and steel are primary raw materials used to produce our mechanical components. Other commodi\u0000es, such as gold, copper, and nickel,\nare also used in the manufacture of our products, although in much smaller quan\u0000\u0000es. We purchase various goods, including component parts and services\nused in produc\u0000on, logis\u0000cs, and product development processes from third par\u0000es. Generally, there are numerous sources for the raw materials and\ncomponents used in our products, which we believe are sufficiently available to meet current requirements.\nWe maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facili\u0000es' produc\u0000on needs while building long-term supplier rela\u0000onships and\nefficiently managing our overall supply costs. We expect our suppliers to maintain adequate levels of quality raw materials and component parts, and to\ndeliver such parts on a \u0000mely basis to support produc\u0000on of our various products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to protect our\nintellectual property and processes and to monitor and mi\u0000gate risks of disrup\u0000on in our supply base that could cause a business disrup\u0000on to our produc\u0000on\nschedules or to our customers. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, business con\u0000nuity, quality, delivery, and protec\u0000on of our intellectual\nproperty and processes.\nOur customers expect us to maintain adequate levels of certain finished goods and certain component parts to support our warranty commitments and\nsales to our a\u0000ermarket customers, and to deliver such parts on a \u0000mely basis to support our customers’ standard and customary needs. We carry certain\nfinished goods and component parts in inventory to meet these rapid delivery requirements of our customers.\nResearch and Development\nWe finance our research and development ac\u0000vi\u0000es primarily with our own funds. Our research and development costs include basic research, applied\nresearch, component and systems development, and concept formula\u0000on studies.\n5\nWe collaborate closely with our customers as they develop their technology plans, which leads to new product concepts. We believe this collabora\u0000on\nallows us to develop technology, new systems, and products that are aligned with our customers’ needs and future performance, which increases the\nlikelihood that our systems and components will be selected for inclusion in the pla\u0000orms developed by our customers. Further, we believe our close\ncollabora\u0000on with our customers during preliminary design stages allows us to provide products that deliver the component and system performance\nnecessary to bring greater value to our customers. This preliminary work may include opportuni\u0000es to test new products in order to validate concepts and\ndemonstrate performance in challenging environments. We strive to stay ahead of the compe\u0000\u0000on through our modeling, prototyping, and state of the art\ntest capabili\u0000es.\nAerospace is focused on developing systems and components that we believe will be instrumental in helping our customers achieve their objec\u0000ves of\nlower fuel consump\u0000on, lighter weight, more efficient performance, reduced emissions, and improved opera\u0000ng economics. We support our engine and\nairframe customers as they develop next genera\u0000on designs across the commercial avia\u0000on, general avia\u0000on, civil private, and military markets. Our\ndevelopment efforts support technology for a wide range of:\n• aerospace turbine engine applica\u0000ons, which include commercial, business, and military turbofan engines of various thrust classes, turbosha\u0000\nengines, and turboprop engines;\n• electromechanical and hydraulic actua\u0000on systems for flight deck-to-flight surface control of fixed-wing aircra\u0000 and rotorcra\u0000, and turbine engine\nnacelles, as well as guidance for weapon systems; and\n• mo\u0000on control components for integra\u0000on into comprehensive actua\u0000on systems.\nMost technology development programs begin years before an expected entry to service, such as those for the next genera\u0000on of commercial aircra\u0000.\nOther development programs result in nearer-term product launches associated with new OEM offerings, product upgrades, or product replacements on\nexis\u0000ng programs.\nWe developed the fuel system, air management system, and actua\u0000on hardware for CFM Interna\u0000onal’s LEAP engine program. We also developed\nactua\u0000on system, combus\u0000on system, and oil system components for Pra\u0000 & Whitney’s Geared Turbo Fan (“GTF” or “PurePower”) engine program. We\ncon\u0000nue to support GE Aerospace and CFM for improvements to the LEAP fuel system, and Collins Aerospace and Pra\u0000 & Whitney for improvements to the\nPurePower engine programs.\nIndustrial is focused on developing innova\u0000ve technologies, including integrated control systems and system components, that enable our customers to\ncost-effec\u0000vely meet mandated emissions regula\u0000ons and fuel efficiency demands, allow for usage of a wider range of fuel sources, increase reliability\n(par\u0000cularly in harsh environments), and reduce total cost of ownership. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:\n• products that improve the quality of combus\u0000on processes and provide more precise flow of various fuels and gases in our customers’ gas turbines\nindustrial reciproca\u0000ng engines fueled by bio-diesel and dual-fuel;\n• electronic devices and so\u0000ware solu\u0000ons that provide improved control and protec\u0000on of reciproca\u0000ng engines, gas turbines, steam turbines, and\nengine- and turbine-powered equipment; and\n• advanced predic\u0000ve intelligence that is integrated into many of our complex products and systems.\nHuman Capital\nOur employees (whom we call “members”) are Woodward’s most valuable resource for current and future success. We promote an environment that\nensures safety, encourages diversity and inclusion, fosters growth and self-development, and provides meaningful work. All members par\u0000cipate in our success\nthrough a\u0000rac\u0000ve and aligned total rewards programs. Notable programs we offer to our full-\u0000me members include:\n• employer sponsored health insurance;\n• employer 401(k) matching contribu\u0000ons;\n• annual Woodward stock contribu\u0000ons for U.S. members;\n• a tui\u0000on assistance program;\n• training and professional development courses through our Woodward University curriculum; and\n• other values-based and technical development training\n6\nTenure of all employees averages ten years, reflec\u0000ve of our posi\u0000ve workplace culture. Our recrui\u0000ng team uses internal and external resources to\nrecruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage and reward employee referrals for open posi\u0000ons.\nIn addi\u0000on to our comprehensive investment in our members’ success, we strive to maintain an inclusive environment that values and leverages the\nuniqueness of each member to the benefit of all our stakeholders. We view the combina\u0000on of diverse perspec\u0000ves and backgrounds as a powerful force for\ninnova\u0000on. To promote diversity and our core principles, we emphasize dignity, value, and equality of all members, regardless of race, color, religion, age,\ngender or sexual orienta\u0000on, through our ac\u0000ons and the workplace training programs we provide. We con\u0000nually strive to harness the diversity of our global\nworkforce by cul\u0000va\u0000ng a climate that permits all our members to bring their authen\u0000c selves to work every day.\nThe health and safety of our members is also a top priority. We have implemented appropriate procedures and precau\u0000ons to ensure the con\u0000nued\nsafety and well-being of members. We strive to comply with all federal and local workplace laws and regula\u0000ons where we do business. We are always looking\nfor ways to exceed compliance standards by u\u0000lizing con\u0000nuous improvement discipline to proac\u0000vely eliminate risks in the workplace.\nAs of October 31, 2024, we employed approximately 9,300 full-\u0000me members of which approximately 2,880 were located outside of the United States,\nwith the majority of such members located in Germany, Poland, and China.\nIn the United States, approximately 13% of our total full-\u0000me workforce were union members as of October 31, 2024. All union members in the United\nStates work for our Aerospace segment. The collec\u0000ve bargaining agreements with our union members are generally renewed through contract renego\u0000a\u0000on\nnear the contract expira\u0000on dates. The MPC Employees Representa\u0000ve Union contract, which covered approximately 800 members as of October 31, 2024,\nexpires September 30, 2025. The Local Lodge 727-N Interna\u0000onal Associa\u0000on of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreement, which covers approximately\n400 members as of October 31, 2024, expires April 23, 2027.\nIn Germany, approximately 13% of our total full-\u0000me workforce were union members as of October 31, 2024, all of whom work for our Industrial\nsegment. Our Woodward L’Orange members are part of the IG Metall union in Germany. IG Metall covered approximately 1,200 members as of October 31,\n2024.\nWe believe we have good, collabora\u0000ve rela\u0000onships with our union members and the representa\u0000ve unions.\nAlmost all of our other members in the United States were at-will members as of October 31, 2024, and therefore, not subject to any type of\nemployment contract or agreement. Our execu\u0000ve officers each have severance and change-in-control agreements which have been filed with the SEC.\nOutside of the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such rela\u0000onships are mandatory or\ncustomary, including coordina\u0000on through local works’ councils. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary\nterms in the subject jurisdic\u0000on.\nPatents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing\nWe own numerous patents and other intellectual property, and have licenses for the use of patents and other intellectual property owned by others,\nwhich relate to our products and their manufacture. In addi\u0000on to owning a large por\u0000olio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and\nfrom third par\u0000es. For example, the U.S. Government has certain rights in our patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of certain\ngovernment contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inven\u0000ons covered by such patents for government purposes as allowed by law.\nIntellectual property not covered by patents (or patent applica\u0000ons) includes trade secrets and other technological know-how that is not patentable or\nfor which we have elected not to seek patent protec\u0000on, including intellectual property rela\u0000ng to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs. Such\nunpatented technology, including research, development and engineering technical skills and know-how, as well as unpatented so\u0000ware, is important to our\noverall business and to the opera\u0000ons of each of our segments.\nWhile our intellectual property assets taken together are important, we do not believe our business or either of our segments would be materially\naffected by the expira\u0000on of any par\u0000cular intellectual property right or termina\u0000on of any par\u0000cular intellectual property patent license agreement.\n7\nAs of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes $440,419 of net intangible assets. This value represents the carrying values, net of\namor\u0000za\u0000on, of certain assets acquired in various business acquisi\u0000ons and does not purport to represent the fair value of our acquired intellectual property\nas of September 30, 2024.\nEnvironmental Ma\u0000ers and Climate Change\nThe Company is regulated by federal, state, and interna\u0000onal environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of\nemissions. Compliance with these exis\u0000ng laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global compe\u0000\u0000ve posi\u0000on.\nWe use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing opera\u0000ons. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future\nacquire facili\u0000es that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We believe the risk that a significant release of regulated\nmaterials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. From \u0000me to \u0000me, we engage in environmental\nremedia\u0000on ac\u0000vi\u0000es, generally in coordina\u0000on with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. In addi\u0000on, we may be exposed to other\nenvironmental costs including par\u0000cipa\u0000on in superfund sites or other similar jurisdic\u0000onal ini\u0000a\u0000ves. When it is reasonably probable that we will incur\nremedia\u0000on costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably es\u0000mated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings.\nIn formula\u0000ng that es\u0000mate and recognizing those costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies, or others, un\u0000l\nsuch recovery is assured. Currently, we have no sites undergoing remedia\u0000on.\nOur manufacturing facili\u0000es generally do not produce volumes or quan\u0000\u0000es of byproducts, including greenhouse gases, that would be considered\nhazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment. We do not expect legisla\u0000on currently pending or expected in the next several years to have a\nsignificant nega\u0000ve impact on our opera\u0000ons in any of our segments.\nDomes\u0000c and foreign legisla\u0000ve ini\u0000a\u0000ves on emissions control, renewable energy, and climate change tend to favorably impact the sale of our energy\ncontrol products. For example, our Industrial segment produces energy control products that help our customers maximize engine efficiency and minimize\nwasteful emissions, including greenhouse gases.\nIn 2023, we released our fourth sustainability report, where we con\u0000nue to build upon our commitments to sustainability in areas of environmental\nstewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance. We apply a systema\u0000c approach to iden\u0000fying, evalua\u0000ng, and managing risks across our\nopera\u0000ons, with the goal to be a supplier, community partner, and employer of choice.\nThe full report can be found on the Sustainability at Woodward sec\u0000on of our website.\nAvailable Informa\u0000on\nThrough a link on the Investor Informa\u0000on sec\u0000on of our website, www.woodward.com, we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon\nas reasonably prac\u0000cable a\u0000er they are electronically filed or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current\nReports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sec\u0000on 13(a) or 15(d) of the\nSecuri\u0000es Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Sec\u0000on 16 reports of our officers and directors. The Securi\u0000es and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) also maintains\na website that contains our SEC filings. The address of the site is www.sec.gov. We provide no\u0000fica\u0000ons of news or announcements regarding our financial\nperformance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases as part of our investor rela\u0000ons website. We have used, and intend to con\u0000nue\nto use, our investor rela\u0000ons website, as well as the following as of the date of this filing, as means of disclosing material non-public informa\u0000on and for\ncomplying with the disclosure obliga\u0000ons under Regula\u0000on FD:\n• X: X.com/@woodward_inc\n• Facebook: Facebook.com/woodwardinc\n• Instagram: Instagram.com/@woodward_inc\n• LinkedIn: Linkedin.com/company/woodwardinc\n• YouTube: YouTube.com/user/woodwardinc\nAll links to websites are intended to be inac\u0000ve.

Risk Factors\nThe following summarizes important factors that could individually, or together with one or more other factors, affect our business, financial condi\u0000on,\nresults of opera\u0000ons, and/or cash flows:\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in highly compe\u0000\u0000ve industries and, if we are unable to compete effec\u0000vely in one or more of our markets, our business, financial condi\u0000on,\nand results of opera\u0000ons will be adversely affected.\nWe face intense compe\u0000\u0000on from a number of established compe\u0000tors in the United States and abroad, some of which are larger in size or are divisions\nof large, diversified companies with substan\u0000ally greater financial resources. In addi\u0000on, global compe\u0000\u0000on con\u0000nues to increase. Changes in compe\u0000\u0000ve\ncondi\u0000ons, including the availability of new technologies, products and services, the introduc\u0000on of new channels of distribu\u0000on, changes in OEM and\na\u0000ermarket pricing, and further consolida\u0000on of companies in our industries, could impact our rela\u0000onships with our customers and may adversely affect\nfuture sales and margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nFurther, the markets in which we operate experience rapidly changing technologies and frequent introduc\u0000ons of new products and services. Our\ntechnologies and the technological exper\u0000se we have developed and maintained could become less valuable if a compe\u0000tor were to develop a new\ntechnology that would allow it to match or exceed the performance of exis\u0000ng technologies at a lower cost. If we are unable to develop compe\u0000\u0000ve\ntechnologies, future sales or earnings could be lower than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of\nopera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nA significant por\u0000on of our revenue is concentrated among a rela\u0000vely small number of customers, which makes our business more vulnerable to\nfluctua\u0000ons in sales to these customers and changes in their financial condi\u0000on.\nA significant por\u0000on of our revenue is concentrated among a rela\u0000vely small number of customers. We have fewer customers than many companies\nwith similar sales volumes. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, sales to our largest 5 customers represented approximately 35% of our consolidated\nnet sales and approximately 31% of our accounts receivable. If any of our significant customers were to change suppliers, in-source produc\u0000on, ins\u0000tute\nsignificant restructuring or cost-cu\u0000ng measures, or experience financial distress, these significant customers may substan\u0000ally reduce, or otherwise be\nunable to pay for, purchases from us. Accordingly, our consolidated net sales could decrease significantly, or we may experience difficulty collec\u0000ng, or be\nunable to collect, amounts due and payable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash\nflows.\nThe long sales cycle, customer evalua\u0000on process, and implementa\u0000on period of our products and services may increase the costs of obtaining orders and\nreduce the predictability of sales cycles and our inventory requirements.\nOur products and services are technologically complex and require significant capital commitments. Prospec\u0000ve customers generally must commit\nsignificant resources to test and evaluate our products and to install and integrate them into larger systems. Accordingly, customers o\u0000en require a significant\nnumber of product presenta\u0000ons and demonstra\u0000ons before reaching a sufficient level of confidence in the product’s performance and compa\u0000bility to\ncommit to an order. In addi\u0000on, orders expected in one quarter may shi\u0000 to another quarter or be cancelled with li\u0000le advance no\u0000ce as a result of customers’\nbudgetary constraints, internal acceptance reviews, and other factors affec\u0000ng the \u0000ming of customers’ purchase decisions. The difficulty in forecas\u0000ng\ndemand increases the challenge in an\u0000cipa\u0000ng sales cycles and our inventory requirements, which may cause us to over-produce finished goods and could\nresult in inventory write-offs, or could cause us to under-produce finished goods. Any such over-produc\u0000on or under-produc\u0000on could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nOur strategic joint venture with GE Aerospace may make it more difficult to secure long-term sales in certain aerospace markets.\nIn January 2016, Woodward and GE, consummated the forma\u0000on of a strategic joint venture (the “JV”) and since April 2024, GE has been ac\u0000ng through\nGE Aerospace. The JV agreement does not restrict Woodward from entering into any market; however, consolida\u0000on in the aircra\u0000 engine market is\nincreasingly prevalent, resul\u0000ng in fewer engine manufacturers, and thus it may become more difficult for Woodward to secure new business with GE\nAerospace compe\u0000tors on similar product applica\u0000ons both within and outside the specific markets the JV operates. Addi\u0000onally, if GE\n9\nAerospace fails to win new content in the market space covered by the JV, Woodward may be prevented from expanding content on future commercial aircra\u0000\nengines in those markets.\nCommercial, Financial, and Regulatory Risks\nSuppliers may be unable to provide us with materials of sufficient quality or quan\u0000ty to meet our produc\u0000on needs at favorable prices or at all which may\nadversely affect our revenue and margins.\nWe are dependent upon suppliers for parts and raw materials used in the manufacture of products that we sell to our customers, and our raw material\ncosts are subject to commodity market fluctua\u0000ons and have been impacted by the current infla\u0000onary environment. We have experienced shortages of\ncertain parts and raw materials due to challenges in our supply chain, although we have made strategic investments to simplify and strengthen our supply\nchain. We may con\u0000nue to experience shortages of parts or raw materials for the same or other reasons, such as the loss of a significant supplier, high overall\ndemand crea\u0000ng shortages in parts and supplies we use, financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters, fluctua\u0000ons in commodity prices, the imposi\u0000on\nof tariffs or other du\u0000es, or produc\u0000on or distribu\u0000on difficul\u0000es that may affect one or more of our suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single\nsource of supply, manufacturing, or logis\u0000cs support or par\u0000cipate in commodity markets that may be subject to alloca\u0000ons of limited supplies by suppliers.\nSome of our suppliers have experienced, and others may similarly experience, financial difficul\u0000es, delivery delays or other performance problems, and, as a\nresult, we have from \u0000me to \u0000me been, and may in the future be, unable to meet commitments to our customers and/or incur addi\u0000onal costs. Our customers\nrely on us to provide on-\u0000me delivery and have certain rights if our delivery standards are not maintained. A significant increase in our supply costs, including\nfor raw materials that are subject to commodity price fluctua\u0000ons, infla\u0000onary pressures, and/or the imposi\u0000on of tariffs, or a protracted interrup\u0000on of\nsupplies for any reason, could result in the delay of one or more of our customer contracts, increase our costs, result in lost revenue or could damage our\nreputa\u0000on and rela\u0000onships with customers. In addi\u0000on, quality and sourcing issues that our suppliers may experience can also adversely affect the quality\nand effec\u0000veness of our products and services and may result in liability or reputa\u0000onal harm to us. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nOur profitability may suffer if we are unable to manage our expenses in connec\u0000on with sales increases, sales decreases, or if we experience change in\nproduct mix.\nSome of our expenses are rela\u0000vely fixed in rela\u0000on to changes in sales volume and are difficult to adjust in the short term. Expenses driven by business\nac\u0000vity other than sales level and other long-term expenditures, such as fixed manufacturing costs, capital expenditures, and research and development\nexpenses may be difficult to reduce in a \u0000mely manner in response to a reduc\u0000on in sales. In periods of rapid sales increases it may be difficult to quickly\nincrease our produc\u0000on of finished goods because of our long manufacturing lead \u0000mes. If a sudden, unan\u0000cipated need for raw materials, components and\nlabor arises, we could experience difficul\u0000es in sourcing these items at a favorable cost, in sufficient quan\u0000\u0000es or at all. These factors could result in delays in\nfulfilling customer sales contracts, lost revenue, damage to our reputa\u0000on and rela\u0000onships with our customers, and an inability to meet market demand,\nwhich in turn could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportuni\u0000es or responding to compe\u0000\u0000ve pressures and could result in an increase in costs\nleading to a decrease in net earnings or even net losses. In addi\u0000on, we sell products that have varying profit margins, and fluctua\u0000ons in the mix of sales of\nour various products may affect our overall profitability.\nReduc\u0000ons, delays or changes in U.S. Government spending could adversely affect our business.\nSales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and en\u0000\u0000es, or indirectly through third party manufacturers, such as \u0000er-one prime contractors,\nu\u0000lizing our parts and subassemblies, accounted for approximately 17% of total sales in both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023.\nThe U.S. Government par\u0000cipates in a wide variety of opera\u0000ons, including homeland defense, counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and other defense-\nrelated opera\u0000ons that employ our products and services. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical in nature and is subject to periodic congressional\nauthoriza\u0000on and appropria\u0000on ac\u0000ons. The level of U.S. defense spending is hard to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors outside of our control\nsuch as changes in the perceived threat environment, prevailing U.S. foreign policy, changes in security, defense, and intelligence strategies and priori\u0000es, shi\u0000s\nin domes\u0000c and interna\u0000onal spending, the macroeconomic environment, tax policy, budget deficits and compe\u0000ng budget priori\u0000es, and the poli\u0000cal\nenvironment and future poten\u0000al government shutdowns.\nDefense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to na\u0000onal security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety, but we can provide no\nassurance that an increase in defense spending will be allocated to programs that\n10\nwould benefit our business. Decreases in U.S. Government defense spending, changes in the spending alloca\u0000on, phase-outs or termina\u0000ons of certain\naerospace and defense programs on which we have content could have a material adverse effect on our sales unless they are offset by other aerospace and\ndefense programs and opportuni\u0000es. If the priori\u0000es of the U.S. Government change and/or defense spending is reduced or delayed for any of the reasons\ndiscussed above, our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by risks unique to government contrac\u0000ng.\nAs a result of our contracts with the U.S. Government, we are subject to certain unique risks, including the risks set forth below:\n• Our U.S. Government contracts and the U.S. Government contracts of our customers are subject to modifica\u0000on, curtailment or termina\u0000on by the\ngovernment, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of a failure by us or our customers to perform under the\napplicable contract. If any of our contracts are terminated by the U.S. Government, our backlog would be reduced, in accordance with contract\nterms, by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts. In addi\u0000on, we are not the prime contractor on most of our contracts for\nsupply to the U.S. Government, and the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespec\u0000ve of the\nquality of our products and services as a subcontractor.\n• We must comply with procurement laws and regula\u0000ons rela\u0000ng to the forma\u0000on, administra\u0000on, and performance of our U.S. Government\ncontracts and the U.S. Government contracts of our customers. The U.S. Government may change procurement laws and regula\u0000ons from \u0000me to\n\u0000me. A viola\u0000on of U.S. Government procurement laws or regula\u0000ons, a change in U.S. Government procurement laws and regula\u0000ons, or a\ntermina\u0000on arising out of our default could expose us to liability, debarment, or suspension and could have an adverse effect on our ability to\ncompete for future contracts and orders.\n• We are subject to government inquiries, audits, and inves\u0000ga\u0000ons due to our business rela\u0000onships with the U.S. Government and the heavily\nregulated industries in which we do business. In addi\u0000on, our contract costs are subject to audits by the U.S. Government. U.S. Government\nagencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, rou\u0000nely audit government contractors and\nsubcontractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regula\u0000ons, and\nstandards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or\ninaccurately allocated to a specific contract would be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, would be refunded. Any\ninadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholdings on billed receivables, penal\u0000es, and reduced future business. Any inquiries or\ninves\u0000ga\u0000ons, including those related to our contract pricing, could poten\u0000ally result in civil and criminal penal\u0000es and administra\u0000ve sanc\u0000ons,\nincluding termina\u0000on of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, suspension, and/or debarment from par\u0000cipa\u0000ng in future\nbusiness opportuni\u0000es with the U.S. Government. Such ac\u0000ons could harm our reputa\u0000on, even if such allega\u0000ons are later determined to be\nunfounded, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these risks, some of which are out of our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nOur debt obliga\u0000ons and the restric\u0000ve covenants in the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to operate our business or pursue our\nbusiness strategies, could adversely affect our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows, and could significantly reduce stockholder\nbenefits from a change of control event.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total debt was $872,470, including $475,000 in unsecured notes denominated in U.S. dollars issued in private placements\nand $178,624 of unsecured notes denominated in Euros issued in private placements. We are obligated to make interest and scheduled principal payments\nunder the agreements governing our long-term debt, which requires us to dedicate a por\u0000on of our cash flow from opera\u0000ons to payments on our\nindebtedness, and which may reduce the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts and mergers and acquisi\u0000ons.\nThese debt obliga\u0000ons could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry condi\u0000ons and could limit our flexibility in planning for, or\nreac\u0000ng to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, thereby placing us at a disadvantage to our compe\u0000tors that have less\nindebtedness. Further, we may require addi\u0000onal capital to repay our debt obliga\u0000ons when they mature, and such capital may not be available on terms\nacceptable to us or at all.\n11\nOur exis\u0000ng revolving credit facility and note purchase agreements impose financial covenants on us and our subsidiaries that require us to maintain\ncertain leverage ra\u0000os and minimum levels of consolidated net worth. Certain of these agreements require us to repay outstanding borrowings with por\u0000ons\nof the proceeds we receive from certain sales of property or assets and specified future debt offerings.\nThese financial covenants place certain restric\u0000ons on our business that may affect our ability to execute our business strategy successfully or take other\nac\u0000ons that we believe would be in the best interests of our Company. These covenants include limita\u0000ons or restric\u0000ons, among other things, on our ability\nand the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n• incur addi\u0000onal indebtedness;\n• pay dividends or make distribu\u0000ons on our capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments;\n• purchase or redeem stock;\n• issue stock of our subsidiaries;\n• make domes\u0000c and foreign investments and extend credit;\n• engage in transac\u0000ons with affiliates;\n• transfer and sell assets;\n• effect a consolida\u0000on or merger or sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substan\u0000ally all of our assets; and\n• create liens on our assets to secure debt.\nThese agreements contain certain customary events of default, including certain cross-default provisions related to other outstanding debt\narrangements. Any breach of the covenants under these agreements or other event of default could cause a default under these agreements and/or a cross-\ndefault under our other debt arrangements, which could restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. If there were an event of default\nunder certain provisions of our debt arrangements that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt may be able to cause all amounts\noutstanding with respect to the debt instrument, plus any required se\u0000lement costs, to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and available cash\nbalances may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. If we are unable to\nrepay, refinance, or restructure our indebtedness as required, or amend the covenants contained in these agreements, the lenders or note holders may be\nen\u0000tled to obtain a lien or ins\u0000tute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nAddi\u0000onal tax expense or addi\u0000onal tax exposures could impact our future profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and jurisdic\u0000ons outside of the United States. Our tax liabili\u0000es are dependent upon the\ndistribu\u0000on mix of opera\u0000ng income among these different jurisdic\u0000ons. Our tax expense includes es\u0000mates of addi\u0000onal tax that may be incurred and reflects\nvarious es\u0000mates, projec\u0000ons, and assump\u0000ons that could impact the valua\u0000on of our deferred tax assets and liabili\u0000es. Our future opera\u0000ng results could be\nadversely affected by changes in the effec\u0000ve tax rate, which could be caused by, among other things:\n• changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates;\n• changes in our overall profitability;\n• changes in rules or interpreta\u0000ons of exis\u0000ng tax laws;\n• changes in U.S. federal tax legisla\u0000on and tax rates;\n• changes in state or non-U.S. government tax legisla\u0000on and tax rates;\n• changes in tax incen\u0000ves;\n• changes in U.S. GAAP;\n• changes in the projected realiza\u0000on of deferred tax assets and liabili\u0000es;\n• changes in management’s assessment of the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore;\n• changes in management’s inten\u0000ons regarding the amount of earnings reinvested offshore; and\n• the results of audits and examina\u0000ons of previously filed tax returns and con\u0000nuing assessments of our tax exposures.\n12\nWe derive a significant amount of revenue and obtain components from outside of the United States; accordingly, we are subject to the risks of doing\nbusiness in other countries.\nIn fiscal year 2024, approximately 49% of our total sales were made to customers in jurisdic\u0000ons outside of the United States (including products\nmanufactured in the United States and sold outside the United States as well as products manufactured in interna\u0000onal loca\u0000ons). We also purchase raw\nmaterials and components from suppliers outside the United States. Accordingly, our business and results of opera\u0000ons are subject to risks associated with\ndoing business interna\u0000onally, including:\n• transporta\u0000on delays and interrup\u0000ons;\n• poli\u0000cal, social and economic instability and disrup\u0000ons;\n• natural disasters or pandemics;\n• terrorism, war, and interna\u0000onal tensions and conflicts;\n• the imposi\u0000on of taxes, import and export controls, du\u0000es and tariffs, embargoes, sanc\u0000ons and other trade restric\u0000ons;\n• fluctua\u0000ons in currency exchange rates;\n• different and changing regulatory environments;\n• cost of compliance with increasingly complex and o\u0000en conflic\u0000ng regula\u0000ons governing various ma\u0000ers worldwide;\n• cost of labor, labor shortages, and other changes in labor condi\u0000ons;\n• the poten\u0000al for na\u0000onaliza\u0000on of enterprises;\n• poten\u0000al limita\u0000ons on the Company’s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, including protec\u0000on of intellectual property;\n• difficulty of enforcing agreements and collec\u0000ng receivables through some foreign legal systems;\n• poten\u0000ally adverse tax consequences, including limita\u0000ons on repatria\u0000ons of earnings; and\n• difficul\u0000es in implemen\u0000ng restructuring ac\u0000ons on a \u0000mely basis.\nThe implementa\u0000on of tariffs could increase the cost of certain commodi\u0000es and/or limit their supply. Over the longer term, tariffs could significantly\nincrease our costs and our ability to pass such increased costs along to our customers may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to and must comply with U.S. laws restric\u0000ng or otherwise prohibi\u0000ng companies from doing business in certain countries and with\ncertain par\u0000es, including those on exports imposed under the U.S. Export Control Laws and Sanc\u0000ons Programs. These laws and regula\u0000ons change from \u0000me\nto \u0000me and may restrict sales to other countries or par\u0000es.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Prac\u0000ces Act (“FCPA”) and similar an\u0000-bribery and an\u0000-corrup\u0000on laws and regula\u0000ons in other jurisdic\u0000ons\ngenerally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining\nbusiness or securing an improper business advantage. We operate in many parts of the world and sell to industries that have experienced corrup\u0000on to some\ndegree. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other similar an\u0000-bribery law or regulatory viola\u0000ons, we could be subject to civil and criminal penal\u0000es or\nother sanc\u0000ons that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nAlso, a material disrup\u0000on to the financial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons with whom we transact business could have a material adverse effect on our interna\u0000onal\nopera\u0000ons or on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nChanges in the es\u0000mates of fair value of repor\u0000ng units or of long-lived assets, par\u0000cularly goodwill, may result in future impairment charges, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, and results of opera\u0000on.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $806,643 of goodwill, represen\u0000ng approximately 18% of our total assets. We test goodwill for impairment at the\nrepor\u0000ng unit level on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair\nvalue of a repor\u0000ng unit below its carrying amount. Future goodwill impairment charges may occur if es\u0000mates of fair values decrease, which would reduce\nfuture earnings. In addi\u0000on, we may incur asset impairment charges if asset u\u0000liza\u0000on declines, if customer demand decreases, or for a number of other\nreasons, which would reduce future earnings. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, and\nresults of opera\u0000ons.\n13\nThere can be no assurance that our es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons of the fair value of our repor\u0000ng units, the current economic environment, or the other\ninputs used in forecas\u0000ng the present value of forecasted cash flows used to es\u0000mate the fair value of our repor\u0000ng units will prove to be accurate projec\u0000ons\nof future performance, and any material error in our es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons, could result in us needing to take a material impairment charge, which would\nhave the effects discussed above.\nOur inability to retain key personnel or a\u0000ract and retain new qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to operate\nsuccessfully.\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, compe\u0000\u0000on for technical personnel is intense and our future performance is highly dependent on our\nability to hire, train, assimilate, and retain a qualified workforce. Addi\u0000onally, it is important we hire and retain personnel with relevant experience in local\nlaws, regula\u0000ons, customs, tradi\u0000ons, and business prac\u0000ces to support our interna\u0000onal opera\u0000ons. Achieving this objec\u0000ve may be difficult due to many\nfactors, including fluctua\u0000ons in global economic and industry condi\u0000ons, management changes, increasing local and global compe\u0000\u0000on for talent, the\navailability of qualified employees, challenges associated with retaining qualified employees, restructuring and alignment ac\u0000vi\u0000es, and the a\u0000rac\u0000veness of\nour compensa\u0000on and benefit programs.\nOur financial and opera\u0000ng performance depends on con\u0000nued access to a stable workforce and on favorable labor rela\u0000ons with our employees.\nWe rely on a highly trained workforce due to the specialized nature of our business. Further, approximately 13% of our workforce in the United States is\nunionized, and certain of our opera\u0000ons in the United States and interna\u0000onally involve different employee/employer rela\u0000onships and the existence of works’\ncouncils. We periodically need to renego\u0000ate our collec\u0000ve bargaining agreements, and any failure to nego\u0000ate new agreements or extensions in a \u0000mely\nmanner could result in work stoppages or slowdowns. Any significant increases in labor costs, deteriora\u0000on of employee rela\u0000ons, including any conflicts with\nworks’ councils or unions, or slowdowns or work stoppages at any of our loca\u0000ons, whether due to employee turnover, changes in availability of qualified\ntechnical personnel, failure to have a collabora\u0000ve and effec\u0000ve rela\u0000onship with our employees, including our union employees, or an effec\u0000ve collec\u0000ve\nbargaining agreement in place with our union employees, or otherwise, could impair our ability to supply products or fulfill orders, and could otherwise have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, our rela\u0000onships with customers, and our financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows. Further increases\nin labor costs could significantly reduce our profit margins if we are unable to flow such costs through to our customers.\nOur opera\u0000ons and suppliers may be subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt our opera\u0000ons.\nOur opera\u0000ons and sources of supply could be disrupted by unforeseen events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods,\nand other forms of severe weather in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, any of which could adversely affect our opera\u0000ons\nand financial performance. Natural disasters, public health concerns and pandemics, war, poli\u0000cal unrest, terrorist ac\u0000vity, equipment failures, power outages,\nthreats to physical security of our facili\u0000es, assets or people, or the security of our informa\u0000on technology (\"IT\") infrastructure and systems or other\nunforeseen events could result in physical damage to or other disrup\u0000on of, and complete or par\u0000al closure of, one or more of our manufacturing facili\u0000es, or\ncould cause temporary or long-term disrup\u0000on in the supply of component products from some local and interna\u0000onal suppliers, disrup\u0000on in the transport of\nour products and significant delays in the shipment of products and the provision of services, which could in turn cause the loss of sales and customers.\nExis\u0000ng insurance arrangements may not provide protec\u0000on for all the costs that may arise from such events. Accordingly, disrup\u0000on of our opera\u0000ons or the\nopera\u0000ons of a significant supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nFailure to develop, obtain, enforce, and protect intellectual property rights or third par\u0000es claims that we are infringing their intellectual property could\nharm our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop technologies and inven\u0000ons and other intellectual property, and obtain intellectual property rights\nand enforce such intellectual property rights worldwide. In this regard, we rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and\nin other jurisdic\u0000ons where we do business, as well as license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, and confiden\u0000ality and other contractual provisions.\nHowever, we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights in our new technologies and inven\u0000ons or, if we do,\nthe scope of such rights may not be sufficiently broad to afford us any significant commercial advantage over our compe\u0000tors. Further, our exis\u0000ng and future\nintellectual property rights may not provide us with compe\u0000\u0000ve advantages or dis\u0000nguish our products and services from those of our compe\u0000tors. The\ntechnologies\n14\nand inven\u0000ons developed by us in the future may not be considered valuable by customers or provide us with a compe\u0000\u0000ve advantage, or compe\u0000tors may\ndevelop similar or iden\u0000cal technologies and inven\u0000ons independently of us and before we do.\nEffec\u0000ve protec\u0000on of intellectual property rights is expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of applica\u0000on and maintenance costs, as well as\nthe costs of defending and enforcing those rights. Compe\u0000tors and other third par\u0000es may also challenge the ownership, validity, and/or enforceability of our\npatents or other intellectual property rights. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign jurisdic\u0000ons do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to\nthe same extent as do the laws of the United States. To the extent we do assert our intellectual property rights against third par\u0000es, we may not be successful\nand adequate remedies may not be available in the event of infringement or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, or disclosure of our trade\nsecrets.\nThird par\u0000es may in the future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. We cannot\nassure you that our current or future technologies are not, infringing or viola\u0000ng intellectual property rights of third par\u0000es, or will not do so in the future. In\nthe event we face claims of infringement or misappropria\u0000on, we may face expensive li\u0000ga\u0000on or indemnifica\u0000on obliga\u0000ons, be required to enter into\nlicenses, and may be prevented from selling exis\u0000ng products and pursuing product development or commercializa\u0000on. Even if such claims are without merit,\nwe may be required to expend significant \u0000me and resources on the defense of such claims. If we are unable to sufficiently protect our patent and other\nproprietary rights or if we infringe on or misappropriate proprietary rights of others, our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings, inves\u0000ga\u0000ons, claims and/or regulatory proceedings which could have a significant impact on our business and\nopera\u0000ons.\nWe are currently involved or may become involved in legal, regulatory, and other proceedings. These proceedings may include, without limita\u0000on,\nproduct liability ma\u0000ers, intellectual property ma\u0000ers, contract disputes or claims, pending or threatened li\u0000ga\u0000on, governmental inves\u0000ga\u0000ons, as well as\nemployment, tax, environmental, or other ma\u0000ers. These proceedings could lead to enforcement ac\u0000ons, adverse changes to our business prac\u0000ces, fines and\npenal\u0000es, business remedies, or the asser\u0000on of private li\u0000ga\u0000on claims and/or damages that could be material, and of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows. Even if the legal proceedings we face are decided in our favor, or are\nunfounded, we may incur material expenses and such ma\u0000ers may require significant management a\u0000en\u0000on, and may harm our reputa\u0000on with customers,\nemployees or investors. We accrue for known individual ma\u0000ers if we believe it is probable that the ma\u0000er will result in a loss when ul\u0000mately resolved using\nes\u0000mates of the most likely amount of loss. However, es\u0000ma\u0000ng possible losses involves significant judgment and outcomes are unpredictable, therefore,\nactual losses may exceed our es\u0000mates.\nOur business and opera\u0000ons may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other informa\u0000on technology system or network interrup\u0000ons or\nintrusions.\nWe depend heavily on the confiden\u0000ality, integrity, and availability of our IT and computerized systems to communicate and operate effec\u0000vely. We\nstore sensi\u0000ve data, including proprietary business informa\u0000on, intellectual property, classified informa\u0000on, customer informa\u0000on, supplier informa\u0000on, and\nconfiden\u0000al employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. Also, due to poli\u0000cal uncertainty and hos\u0000le military ac\u0000ons, we may be subject to\nheightened risks of cybersecurity incidents and security breaches ini\u0000ated by na\u0000on-state or affiliated actors.\nFrom \u0000me to \u0000me, we have experienced cybera\u0000acks on our IT infrastructure and systems. We may become the target of cyber-a\u0000acks by third par\u0000es,\neither directly or indirectly via our supply chain or third-party vendors, seeking unauthorized access to our data or our customers’ data or to disrupt our\nopera\u0000ons or our ability to provide services. There is also a danger of loss, misuse, the\u0000, unavailability, or unauthorized disclosure or other processing of\ninforma\u0000on or assets (including source code), or damage to or other compromise of systems, components, and other IT assets, including the introduc\u0000on of\nmalicious code or other vulnerabili\u0000es by people who obtain unauthorized access to our facili\u0000es, systems, or informa\u0000on. There are many different\ntechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems and data, and such techniques con\u0000nue to evolve and become more sophis\u0000cated, and the\nadversaries are becoming more advanced, including na\u0000on states and actors sponsored by or affiliated with na\u0000on states, which target us and other defense\ncontractors because we protect na\u0000onal security informa\u0000on, and other actors with substan\u0000al financial and technological resources. These techniques\ninclude, but are not limited to, the use of malicious so\u0000ware, destruc\u0000ve malware, ransomware, denial of service a\u0000acks, phishing and other means of social\nengineering, and other means of causing system or network disrup\u0000ons, obtaining unauthorized access to data or systems, or causing other cybersecurity\nbreaches and\n15\nincidents. Addi\u0000onally, system and service disrup\u0000ons, and cybersecurity breaches or incidents, may result from employee or contractor error, negligence, or\nmalfeasance. Further, there have been and may con\u0000nue to be cybera\u0000acks on, and other a\u0000empts to compromise the security of, the supply chain. We may\nexperience security breaches or incidents resul\u0000ng from tools, services, or other third-party components and security vulnerabili\u0000es within, or introduced by,\nsuch tools, services, or components. Due to the rapidly evolving threat environment and other factors, we may not be successful in defending against all such\na\u0000acks. Further, due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the na\u0000onal security aspects of much of the data we protect, the full impact of any\nfuture security breach or incident cannot be predicted.\nWe have implemented various measures, including technical security controls, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and\nsystems, independent third party security assessments, maintenance of backup systems, and the use of disaster recovery sites. In addi\u0000on, we have, among\nother things, endeavored to align our prac\u0000ces and procedures with recognized IT security frameworks and select recommended prac\u0000ces, and through\ncorrobora\u0000on of our policies and procedures with local and federal agencies. Nonetheless, our IT infrastructure, systems, networks, products, solu\u0000ons, and\nservices remain poten\u0000ally vulnerable to numerous addi\u0000onal known or unknown threats. Although we have implemented measures to prevent, detect, and\nrespond to malicious ac\u0000vity, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effec\u0000ve or sufficient to prevent a cybera\u0000ack or other means of effec\u0000ng\ncybersecurity breaches or incidents.\nIf any of our IT infrastructure or systems are damaged, disrupted, or are otherwise impacted by security breaches or incidents, whether from\ncybersecurity a\u0000acks or other causes, or if we suffer any security breach or incident involving unauthorized access to, misuse, acquisi\u0000on, disclosure, loss,\naltera\u0000on, or destruc\u0000on of our data or other data we maintain or otherwise process, we could experience significant opera\u0000onal stoppages, disrup\u0000ons,\ndelays, and/or other detrimental impacts on our opera\u0000ons or investment in research, and may face increased costs, including increased costs of\nimplemen\u0000ng new data protec\u0000on and security measures, policies, and procedures, and costs associated with remedia\u0000ng and otherwise responding to the\nsecurity breach or incident. Any such security breach or incident or the percep\u0000on that it has occurred, also may result reputa\u0000onal damage and increased\nopera\u0000onal costs, regulatory inves\u0000ga\u0000ons, proceedings, and orders, li\u0000ga\u0000on or other demands, indemnity obliga\u0000ons, damages for contract breach, fines or\npenal\u0000es rela\u0000ng to actual or alleged viola\u0000on of applicable laws, regula\u0000ons, or contractual obliga\u0000ons, incen\u0000ves offered to customers or other business\npartners in an effort to maintain business rela\u0000onships, and other costs and liabili\u0000es. Such impacts could result in diminished compe\u0000\u0000ve advantages and\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows. Further, any unauthorized disclosure or use or\nacquisi\u0000on of our intellectual property and/or confiden\u0000al business informa\u0000on could harm our compe\u0000\u0000ve posi\u0000on, result in a loss of intellectual property\nprotec\u0000on, and otherwise reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic ini\u0000a\u0000ves or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate for all liability rela\u0000ng to any actual or poten\u0000al disrup\u0000on or other security breach or\nincident. We cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabili\u0000es actually incurred, that insurance will con\u0000nue to be available to us on\neconomically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful asser\u0000on of one or more large claims\nagainst us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposi\u0000on of\nlarge deduc\u0000ble or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condi\u0000on, opera\u0000ng results, and\nreputa\u0000on.\nData privacy, data protec\u0000on, and cybersecurity may require significant resources and present certain risks.\nWe collect, store, and otherwise process certain confiden\u0000al or sensi\u0000ve data, including personal data and other informa\u0000on that is subject to laws,\nregula\u0000ons, customer-imposed controls, or other actual or asserted obliga\u0000ons. The laws, regula\u0000ons, standards, and other actual and asserted obliga\u0000ons\nrela\u0000ng to privacy, data protec\u0000on, and cybersecurity to which we may be subject, in the U.S. and globally, are evolving. For example, in the European Union,\nthe General Data Protec\u0000on Regula\u0000on imposes stringent requirements applicable to processing personal data and provides for substan\u0000al penal\u0000es for\nnoncompliance, and in the U.S., California and numerous other states have adopted comprehensive privacy laws, with other states considering such laws.\nMany jurisdic\u0000ons around the world have passed or are considering laws and regula\u0000ons rela\u0000ng to privacy, data protec\u0000on, and cybersecurity, including laws\nthat impose cross-border data transfer restric\u0000ons and require certain personal data to be maintained on local servers.\nAny actual or perceived failure to comply with laws, regula\u0000ons, or contractual or other actual or asserted obliga\u0000ons to which we are or are alleged to\nbe subject rela\u0000ng to privacy, data protec\u0000on, or cybersecurity could result in claims, li\u0000ga\u0000on, and regulatory inves\u0000ga\u0000ons and other proceedings, as well as\ndamage to our reputa\u0000on. These could result in substan\u0000al costs, diversion of resources, fines, penal\u0000es, and other damages and liabili\u0000es, and harm to our\ncustomer\n16\nrela\u0000onships, our market posi\u0000on, and our ability to a\u0000ract new customer engagements. Any of these could harm our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of\nopera\u0000ons, and cash flows, poten\u0000ally in a material manner.\nIncreasing emission standards that drive certain product sales may be eased or delayed, which could reduce our compe\u0000\u0000ve advantage.\nWe sell components and systems that have been designed to meet strict emission standards, including standards that have not yet been implemented\nbut are expected to be implemented soon. If these emission standards are eased, developed products may become unnecessary and/or our future sales could\nbe lower as poten\u0000al customers select alterna\u0000ve products or delay adop\u0000on of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nPrices for fossil fuels may increase significantly and dispropor\u0000onately to other sources of fuels used for power genera\u0000on, which could reduce our sales\nand adversely affect our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nCommercial producers of electricity use many of our components and systems, most predominately in their power plants that use natural gas as their\nfuel source. Commercial producers of electricity are o\u0000en in a posi\u0000on to manage the use of different power plant facili\u0000es and make decisions based on\nopera\u0000ng costs. Compared to other sources of fuels used for power genera\u0000on, natural gas prices have increased slower than fuel oil, but about the same as\ncoal. This increase in natural gas prices and any future increases, whether in absolute dollars or rela\u0000ve to other fuel costs such as oil, could impact the sales\nmix of our components and systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nLong-term reduced commodity prices for oil, natural gas, and other minerals may depress the markets for certain of our products and services, par\u0000cularly\nthose from our Industrial segment.\nMany of our Industrial segment OEM and a\u0000ermarket customers and our Aerospace segment rotorcra\u0000 product lines’ customers provide goods and\nservices that support various industrial extrac\u0000on ac\u0000vi\u0000es, including mining, oil and gas explora\u0000on and extrac\u0000on, and transporta\u0000on of raw materials from\nextrac\u0000on sites to refineries and/or processing facili\u0000es. Long-term lower prices for commodi\u0000es such as oil, natural gas, gold, \u0000n, and various other minerals\ncould reduce explora\u0000on ac\u0000vi\u0000es and place downward pressure on demand for our goods and services that support explora\u0000on and extrac\u0000on ac\u0000vi\u0000es.\nBusiness Risks\nOur product development ac\u0000vi\u0000es may not be successful, may be more costly than an\u0000cipated, or we may not be able to produce newly developed\nproducts at a cost that meets the an\u0000cipated product cost structure.\nOur business involves a significant level of product development ac\u0000vi\u0000es, generally in connec\u0000on with our customers’ development ac\u0000vi\u0000es. Industry\nstandards, customer expecta\u0000ons, or other products may emerge that could render one or more of our products or services less desirable or obsolete.\nAddi\u0000onally, our compe\u0000tors may develop new technology, or more efficient ways to produce their exis\u0000ng products that could cause our exis\u0000ng products or\nservices to become less desirable or obsolete. Maintaining our market posi\u0000on requires con\u0000nued investment in research and development. During an\neconomic downturn or a subsequent recovery, we may need to maintain our investment in research and development, which may limit our ability to reduce\nthese expenses in propor\u0000on to a sales shor\u0000all.\nIn addi\u0000on, increased investments in research and development may divert resources from other poten\u0000al investments in our business, such as\nacquisi\u0000ons or investments in our facili\u0000es, processes, and opera\u0000ons. If these ac\u0000vi\u0000es are not as successful as currently an\u0000cipated, are not completed on a\n\u0000mely basis, or are more costly than currently an\u0000cipated, or if we are not able to produce newly developed products at a cost that meets the an\u0000cipated\nproduct cost structure, then our future sales, margins and/or earnings could be lower than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nProduct liability claims, product recalls or other liabili\u0000es associated with the products and services we provide may force us to pay substan\u0000al damage\nawards and other expenses.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products and the services we provide expose us to risks of product and other tort claims, and any resul\u0000ng liability. We\ncurrently have and have had in the past product liability claims rela\u0000ng to our products, and we will likely be subject to addi\u0000onal product liability claims in the\nfuture for past, current, and future products. Some of these claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of\n17\nopera\u0000ons, and cash flows. We also provide certain services to our customers and are subject to claims with respect to the services provided. In providing such\nservices, we may rely on subcontractors to perform all or a por\u0000on of the contracted services. It is possible that we could be liable to our customers for work\nperformed by a subcontractor.\nRegardless of the outcome, product liability claims can be expensive to defend, can divert the a\u0000en\u0000on of management and other personnel for\nsignificant periods of \u0000me, and can cause reputa\u0000onal damage. While we believe that we have appropriate insurance coverage available to us related to any\nsuch claims, our insurance may not cover all liabili\u0000es or be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. An unsuccessful result in connec\u0000on with a\nproduct liability claim, where the liabili\u0000es are not covered by insurance or for which indemnifica\u0000on or other recovery is not available, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nAcquisi\u0000ons, joint ventures, dives\u0000tures, and other transac\u0000ons we enter into could fail to achieve strategic objec\u0000ves, disrupt our ongoing opera\u0000ons,\nresult in opera\u0000ng difficul\u0000es, harm our business, and nega\u0000vely impact our results of opera\u0000ons.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have pursued, and expect to pursue acquisi\u0000ons of other companies and assets. The iden\u0000fica\u0000on, evalua\u0000on, and\nnego\u0000a\u0000on of poten\u0000al acquisi\u0000ons and other strategic transac\u0000ons may divert the a\u0000en\u0000on of management and entail various expenses, whether or not\nsuch transac\u0000ons are ul\u0000mately completed. If we are able to complete a transac\u0000on. The success of these transac\u0000ons depends on, among other things, our\nability to integrate these businesses into our opera\u0000ons and realize the planned synergies. Integra\u0000on of acquired opera\u0000ons may take longer, or be more\ncostly or disrup\u0000ve to our business, than originally an\u0000cipated. The integra\u0000on of these acquisi\u0000ons may require significant a\u0000en\u0000on from our management,\nand the diversion of management’s a\u0000en\u0000on and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. We may also incur\ncosts and divert management a\u0000en\u0000on to acquisi\u0000ons that are never consummated.\nDifficul\u0000es in the integra\u0000on of the acquired business may include consolida\u0000ng the opera\u0000ons, processes, and systems of the acquired business,\nretaining and mo\u0000va\u0000ng key management and employees, and integra\u0000ng exis\u0000ng business rela\u0000onships with suppliers and customers. Even if integra\u0000on is\nsuccessful, the financial and opera\u0000onal results may differ materially from our assump\u0000ons and forecasts due to unforeseen expenses, delays, condi\u0000ons, and\nliabili\u0000es. Evolving regula\u0000ons such as changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll, or pension policies could increase the expected costs of\nacquisi\u0000ons, and fluctua\u0000ons in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the agreed upon purchase price. In addi\u0000on, we may incur unan\u0000cipated costs or\nexpenses following an acquisi\u0000on, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with elimina\u0000ng duplicate facili\u0000es, and other\nliabili\u0000es.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and\ndiversion of management’s \u0000me and a\u0000en\u0000on. Failure to successfully implement our acquisi\u0000on strategy, including successfully integra\u0000ng acquired\nbusinesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nWe also may make strategic dives\u0000tures from \u0000me to \u0000me. We may experience difficulty separa\u0000ng out por\u0000ons of, or en\u0000re, businesses, incur loss of\nrevenue or experience nega\u0000ve impact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits. In addi\u0000on, these types of transac\u0000ons\nmay result in con\u0000nued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the\ntransac\u0000on, or we may remain liable for certain ma\u0000ers. We are not likely to have the same level of control over the divested business, and the performance of\nthose divested businesses could affect our future financial results through addi\u0000onal payment obliga\u0000ons, higher costs or asset write-downs, any of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nOur restructuring ac\u0000vi\u0000es may reduce our profitability, and may not have the intended effects.\nFrom \u0000me to \u0000me, we have implemented restructuring and other ac\u0000ons designed to reduce structural costs, improve opera\u0000onal efficiency, and\nposi\u0000on the Company for long-term profitable growth. Historically, our restructuring ac\u0000vi\u0000es have included workforce management and other restructuring\ncharges related to acquired businesses. Further, we may decide to implement restructuring or alignment ac\u0000vi\u0000es in the future, which may involve, among\nother things, closing plants, moving produc\u0000on lines, or making addi\u0000ons, reduc\u0000ons, or other changes to our management or workforce. These restructuring\nand/or alignment ac\u0000vi\u0000es generally result in charges and expenditures that may adversely affect our financial results for one or more periods.\n18\nRestructuring and/or alignment ac\u0000vi\u0000es can also create unan\u0000cipated consequences, such as instability or distrac\u0000on among our workforce, and we\ncannot be sure that any restructuring or alignment efforts that we undertake will be successful. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize expected cost\nsavings, including, among others, higher than expected severance costs related to staff reduc\u0000ons, higher than expected costs of closing plants, higher costs to\nhire new employees or delays or difficulty hiring the employees needed, higher than expected opera\u0000ng costs associated with moving produc\u0000on lines, delays\nin the an\u0000cipated \u0000ming of ac\u0000vi\u0000es related to our cost-saving plan, and other unexpected costs associated with opera\u0000ng the business.\nIf we are unable to structure our opera\u0000ons in the light of evolving market condi\u0000ons, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nOur manufacturing ac\u0000vi\u0000es may result in future environmental costs or liabili\u0000es.\nWe use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing opera\u0000ons. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future\nacquire facili\u0000es that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We are subject to a substan\u0000al number of costly regula\u0000ons and\nwe must conform our opera\u0000ons to applicable regulatory requirements in all countries in which we operate. The risk that a significant release of regulated\nmaterials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will not\nincur addi\u0000onal material costs or liabili\u0000es as a result of complying with these requirements.\nIn addi\u0000on, we may be subject to other environmental remedia\u0000on costs such as par\u0000cipa\u0000on in superfund sites or other similar jurisdic\u0000onal\nini\u0000a\u0000ves. As a result, we may incur material costs or liabili\u0000es or be required to undertake future environmental remedia\u0000on ac\u0000vi\u0000es that could damage our\nreputa\u0000on and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nFailure of our produc\u0000on lines, or those of our subcontractors, to meet required cer\u0000fica\u0000on standards could disrupt produc\u0000on.\nOur exis\u0000ng produc\u0000on lines, as well as the produc\u0000on lines of our subcontractors, are some\u0000mes required to pass varying levels of qualifica\u0000on with\ncertain of our customers. Some of our customers require that our produc\u0000on lines pass their specific qualifica\u0000on standards and that we, and any\nsubcontractors that we may use, be registered under or cer\u0000fied to certain U.S. or interna\u0000onal quality standards. We may be unable to obtain, maintain, or\nwe may experience delays in obtaining, a cer\u0000fica\u0000on or registra\u0000on to a required quality standard. A delay in obtaining, or the failure to obtain a necessary\nquality cer\u0000fica\u0000on or registra\u0000on could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased produc\u0000on costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons, and cash flows.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe maintain a cybersecurity risk management program based upon the Na\u0000onal Ins\u0000tute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity framework to\nassess, iden\u0000fy, and manage cybersecurity risks. This program is designed to protect business con\u0000nuity and preserve the confiden\u0000ality, integrity, and\ncon\u0000nued availability of our IT systems and infrastructure used in our business as well as the informa\u0000on that we own or is in our care, and is integrated into\nour overall enterprise risk management program.\nWe have established processes to evaluate and address cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis. As part of our risk management program, we engage\nwith external third par\u0000es to measure the effec\u0000veness of our cybersecurity program through penetra\u0000on tests, control assessments, tabletop exercises, and\nother related ac\u0000vi\u0000es. Further, we have implemented a defense-in-depth strategy in which we u\u0000lize real-\u0000me 24/7 monitoring to iden\u0000fy anomalies,\npoten\u0000al threats, and alerts. This cybersecurity strategy incorporates frameworks, policies, and prac\u0000ces designed to protect the privacy and security of our\nsensi\u0000ve informa\u0000on, backed by a suite of security technologies and tools to implement and automate select security protec\u0000ons. We maintain cyber risk and\nrelated insurance policies as a measure of added protec\u0000on.\nWe educate our members to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats. As part of our program, we maintain annual training for all members on\ncybersecurity standards and provide training on how to recognize and properly respond to\n19\nphishing, social engineering schemes, and certain other cyber threats. We equip our members with a mechanism to easily report suspicious emails which are\nanalyzed by our security systems and dedicated incident response team. “Test” phishing assessments are periodically sent to our members. Any failures trigger\na retraining exercise if not properly reported. Also, we have specific and regular training for our IT and finance members, as well as our system administrators.\nIn addi\u0000on, we maintain processes governing interconnec\u0000ons with third-party systems and we perform due diligence procedures before onboarding\nservice providers with access to our systems or processing sensi\u0000ve data on our behalf. This process includes a review of System and Organiza\u0000on Controls\n(\"SOC\") 1 and SOC 2 reports (as each such report is defined by the American Ins\u0000tute of Cer\u0000fied Public Accountants), ISO 27001 cer\u0000fica\u0000ons, and\nCybersecurity Maturity Model Cer\u0000fica\u0000ons (\"CMMC\"), as well as reviewing penetra\u0000on tests, conduc\u0000ng vulnerability tests, and administering security\nques\u0000onnaires and assessments.\nWe are not aware of having experienced risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of opera\u0000ons or financial condi\u0000on. However, risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to exploita\u0000on of vulnerabili\u0000es, ransomware, denial of service, supply chain a\u0000acks, or other similar\nthreats may materially affect us, including our execu\u0000on of business strategy, reputa\u0000on, results of opera\u0000ons and/or financial condi\u0000on. Nonetheless, our IT\ninfrastructure, systems, networks, products, solu\u0000ons, and services remain poten\u0000ally vulnerable to numerous addi\u0000onal known or unknown threats. For\nmore informa\u0000on about the cybersecurity risks we face, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor\nen\u0000tled “Our business and opera\u0000ons may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other informa\u0000on technology system or network interrup\u0000ons\nor intrusions.”\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur cybersecurity program is ul\u0000mately overseen by the Board of Directors. The Audit Commi\u0000ee has responsibility for the oversight of risk\nmanagement ac\u0000vi\u0000es related to cybersecurity and other informa\u0000on security and technology risks.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condi\u0000on and Results of Opera\u0000ons\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in this report. Dollar\nand number of share amounts contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are in thousands, except per share amounts. For a\ndiscussion of the 2023 Results of Opera\u0000ons, including a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal\nyear ended September 30, 2022, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 17, 2023.\nOVERVIEW\nWe enhance the global quality of life and sustainability by op\u0000mizing energy use through improved efficiency and lower emissions. We are an\nindependent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control solu\u0000ons for the aerospace and industrial markets. We design, produce, and service\nreliable, efficient, low-emission, and high-performance energy control products for diverse applica\u0000ons in challenging environments. We have produc\u0000on and\nassembly facili\u0000es primarily in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and promote our products and services through our worldwide loca\u0000ons.\nOur strategic focus is providing energy control and op\u0000miza\u0000on solu\u0000ons for the aerospace and industrial markets. The precise and efficient control of\nenergy, including mo\u0000on, fluid, combus\u0000on, and electrical energy, is a growing requirement in the markets we serve, and we have developed and are execu\u0000ng\non strategies to leverage the macro trends of reducing greenhouse gases, commercializing space, and accelera\u0000ng the digital age. To facilitate a cleaner world,\nwe are partnering with our customers to enable their equipment to be more efficient, capable of u\u0000lizing clean burning fuels, advancing fuel cells, and the\nintegra\u0000on of renewable power in both commercial and defense opera\u0000ons. Our core technologies can be leveraged across our markets and customer\napplica\u0000ons, enabling us to develop and integrate cost-effec\u0000ve and state-of-the-art fuel, combus\u0000on, fluid, actua\u0000on, and electronic systems. We focus\nprimarily on serving OEMs and equipment packagers, partnering with them to bring superior component and system solu\u0000ons to their demanding\napplica\u0000ons. We also provide a\u0000ermarket repair, maintenance, replacement, and other service support for our installed products.\nOur components and integrated systems op\u0000mize performance of commercial aircra\u0000, defense aircra\u0000, military ground vehicles and other equipment,\ngas and steam turbines, industrial diesel, gas, bio-diesel and dual-fuel reciproca\u0000ng engines, and electrical power systems. Our innova\u0000ve mo\u0000on, fluid,\ncombus\u0000on, and electrical energy control systems help our customers offer more cost-effec\u0000ve, cleaner, and more reliable equipment.\nGlobal Business Condi\u0000ons\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we saw significant sales growth and margin expansion. The compounding impacts of our focused efforts on opera\u0000onal\nexcellence enabled us to increase output and capitalize on con\u0000nued strong end market demand for our products and services across the aerospace and\nindustrial markets. We con\u0000nue to be\u0000er align price to the value of our products which helps to mi\u0000gate the ongoing impacts of infla\u0000on.\nWe con\u0000nue to monitor the macroeconomic environment as infla\u0000on, economic uncertainty, and supply chain challenges con\u0000nue to impact certain\naspects of our business. We remain commi\u0000ed to growth, opera\u0000onal excellence, and innova\u0000on to deliver long-term success and enhanced shareholder\nvalue. We are unable to predict the full extent to which macroeconomic factors will con\u0000nue to adversely impact our business, including our opera\u0000onal\nperformance, results of opera\u0000ons, cash flows, financial posi\u0000on, and the achievement of our strategic objec\u0000ves. Such uncertainty may affect our ability to\naccurately predict our future performance and forecast our financial results.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS\nWe serve the aerospace and industrial markets.\nAerospace Markets\nOur aerospace products and systems are primarily used to provide propulsion, actua\u0000on, and mo\u0000on control in both commercial and defense fixed-wing\naircra\u0000, rotorcra\u0000, smart defense, and other defense systems.\nCommercial and Civil Aircra\u0000 – The commercial aerospace markets experienced robust demand in fiscal year 2024 as a result of con\u0000nued global air\ntraffic growth. In response, aircra\u0000 operators are taking delivery of the newest genera\u0000on aircra\u0000 models to meet the growing demand, replace aging aircra\u0000,\nachieve greater fuel efficiency, and lower emissions. The delivery of the newest genera\u0000on of aircra\u0000 is expected to favor our product offerings because we\nhave more content on those aircra\u0000. We expect produc\u0000on levels to con\u0000nue to grow due to strong OEM order backlogs for the new aircra\u0000 models and\ncon\u0000nued demand supply imbalance. Demand in the widebody avia\u0000on market improved in fiscal year 2024\n24\ncompared to recent years due to increasing produc\u0000on rates on the A350, A330neo, Boeing 787, and 777. We expect narrowbody deliveries to improve due to\nbacklog associated with single aisle programs and planned produc\u0000on ramps in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024.\nWe have content on the Airbus A220, A320neo, A330neo, Bell 429, Boeing 737 MAX, 777, 787, and Comac C919. We have been awarded content on the\n777-9 and a variety of business jet pla\u0000orms, among others.\nWe con\u0000nue to explore opportuni\u0000es on new engine and aircra\u0000 programs that are under considera\u0000on or have been recently announced and have\nbeen selected to provide rotary actua\u0000on solu\u0000ons for the NASA and Boeing Transonic Truss-braced Wing (TTBW) X-66A aircra\u0000 demonstrator, which is tes\u0000ng\na concept to reduce fuel burn for the next single aisle aircra\u0000 designs.\nWith the full return to service of the 737 MAX aircra\u0000 and increasing deliveries, ini\u0000al provisioning sales related to the aircra\u0000 and the CFM LEAP engine\naccelerated during the first half of fiscal year 2024.\nIn February 2024, the Federal Avia\u0000on Administra\u0000on (“FAA”) required a quality produc\u0000on plan from Boeing in response to several aircra\u0000 issues. As\npart of this quality produc\u0000on plan, the FAA is exercising enhanced oversight of Boeing, including a requirement that the FAA have approval authority for build\nrate increases on the 737 MAX. During fiscal year 2024, overall 737 MAX orders and demand have not changed significantly. In fiscal year 2024, the enhanced\nFAA oversight had a slightly nega\u0000ve impact on commercial OEM sales, but this was offset by price realiza\u0000on. In the event the FAA approves increases to\nBoeing's build rates, we an\u0000cipate ini\u0000al provisioning sales would con\u0000nue to increase in subsequent periods. In November 2024, Boeing's U.S. West Coast\nfactory workers accepted a new contract offer, ending a seven-week strike that halted produc\u0000on of the 737 MAX as well as the 777. As a result of the work\nstoppage, our direct sales in fiscal year 2025 to Boeing have been nega\u0000vely impacted. However, now that the strike has ended we expect that deliveries of the\n737 MAX program will con\u0000nue to increase in future periods and that the long-term demand for the aircra\u0000 has not changed. However, a prolonged\ndepression of build rates of the Boeing 737 MAX could decrease our OEM and ini\u0000al provisioning sales for the 737 MAX and CFM LEAP engines in the near\nterm, which could have an adverse effect on our business results.\nDefense – In recent years, the defense industry has been strong as budgetary alloca\u0000ons have generally increased since 2016. Ongoing global conflicts\nand prepara\u0000on for near-peer threats are leading to higher global defense budgets. The U.S. Na\u0000onal Defense Authoriza\u0000on Act (\"NDAA\") for fiscal year 2024\nresulted in higher levels of funding for procurement, research and development, and maintenance, which supported our growth for fiscal year 2024. We\nexpect defense research and development, procurement, and maintenance to increase in future years, which would be beneficial for us for future\nopportuni\u0000es in defense markets. Our involvement with a wide variety of defense programs in fixed-wing aircra\u0000, rotorcra\u0000, and weapons systems has\nprovided rela\u0000ve stability for our defense market sales, as some newer programs increase (e.g., F-35 Lightning II and T-7A Trainer), and some legacy programs\ndecrease (e.g., F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet and V-22 Osprey). Other programs are rela\u0000vely steady (e.g., KC-46A Tanker, UH-60 Black Hawk, and A-64 Apache\nhelicopter programs) and some legacy programs, such as the F-15, should maintain or poten\u0000ally increase produc\u0000on. Smart defense programs for which we\nhave sales include the Joint Direct A\u0000ack Muni\u0000on (“JDAM”), Small Diameter Bomb (“SDB”), and AIM-9X smart defense systems. During fiscal year 2024, we\nexperienced significant growth in smart defense programs following mul\u0000ple years of decline. We expect overall demand to increase in the near term for these\nweapons programs.\nA\u0000ermarket – Our commercial a\u0000ermarket business increased significantly in fiscal year 2024, as global air traffic con\u0000nued to grow and ini\u0000al\nprovisioning sales have increased. In addi\u0000on, our products have been selected for new aerospace pla\u0000orms and our content has increased across exis\u0000ng\npla\u0000orms, which drives increased a\u0000ermarket sales. With the entry into service of single aisle aircra\u0000 (Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo), we have seen a\nsignificant increase in ini\u0000al provisioning sales to the operators of these new aircra\u0000. As aircra\u0000 produc\u0000on levels increase to accommodate rising passenger\ndemand and to mi\u0000gate higher opera\u0000ng costs driven largely by higher fuel costs on older and less fuel-efficient aircra\u0000, we expect airlines will re\u0000re older\ngenera\u0000on aircra\u0000 as they reach certain age thresholds (typically between twenty and twenty-five years). However, in the past few years, aircra\u0000 re\u0000rements\nhave lagged historical levels because passenger demand has outpaced deliveries of the newest genera\u0000on aircra\u0000, forcing airlines to keep older genera\u0000on\nlegacy aircra\u0000 in service longer than an\u0000cipated. This has led to increased demand for repairs and spare parts for older engine programs remaining in service,\nconsistent with air traffic growth. This dynamic applies to commercial a\u0000ermarket related to repairs and spare parts for mature legacy programs with large in-\nservice fleets, such as the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 777.\nOur defense a\u0000ermarket sales also increased significantly during fiscal year 2024 due to increased defense budgets resul\u0000ng in opera\u0000ons and\nmaintenance upgrades. Global conflicts and growing interna\u0000onal demand for various other\n25\nmilitary programs con\u0000nue to drive demand for opera\u0000ons of defense aircra\u0000, including fighter jets, transports and both u\u0000lity and a\u0000ack rotorcra\u0000, which are\nall supported by our products and systems. Although we expect variability, which is generally a\u0000ributable to the cycling of various maintenance and upgrade\nprograms, as well as actual usage, our outlook for the defense a\u0000ermarket is strong. This is due primarily to growing fleets, the service lives of exis\u0000ng military\nprograms being extended, and increased demand for repairs and spare parts for older military aircra\u0000 programs remaining in service.\nIndustrial Markets\nOur industrial products are used worldwide in various types of turbine and reciproca\u0000ng engine-powered equipment, including electric power\ngenera\u0000on and distribu\u0000on systems, ships, locomo\u0000ves, compressors, pumps, and other mobile and industrial machines.\nPower Genera\u0000on – The demand for power genera\u0000on, which consists mainly of heavy frame, aero deriva\u0000ve, and small industrial gas turbines,\nincreased in fiscal year 2024 due to increased demand from power genera\u0000on and process industries, par\u0000cularly in North America, the Middle East, Asia, and\nmore broadly in support of fixed genera\u0000on capacity to backstop the growing renewable energy installed base. Start reliability, fuel flexibility, safety, and part-\nload efficiency are all key drivers of the power genera\u0000on market as the conversion from coal to natural gas usage con\u0000nues, and we believe we con\u0000nue to be\nwell posi\u0000oned to meet these market needs on the exis\u0000ng and next genera\u0000on turbines. We project con\u0000nued growth as demand for electricity is expected\nto increase through global electrifica\u0000on and growing power consump\u0000on for data center applica\u0000ons. This overall global demand will primarily be met\nthrough a balance of renewable power sources and newer industrial gas turbines for which we have been awarded increased content.\nTransporta\u0000on – Our key markets for transporta\u0000on include compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas trucks in Asia, mining, and commercial and\ndefense marine markets. While full year sales in our on-highway natural gas truck business in China increased significantly as compared to fiscal year 2023, we\nsaw a material decline in this business from the first half of fiscal year 2024 to the second half due to the deteriora\u0000ng Chinese economy, a narrower natural\ngas to diesel spread, and elevated customer inventory levels. In fiscal year 2025, we expect a decline in demand in our on-highway natural gas trucks business\nin China as compared to fiscal year 2024, and future demand remains uncertain due to the vola\u0000lity of this business. In global marine markets, demand in fiscal\nyear 2024 increased due to increased ship build rates and higher ship u\u0000liza\u0000on, driving current and future a\u0000ermarket ac\u0000vity. Both commercial and defense\nmarine customers con\u0000nue to launch addi\u0000onal projects to support new programs or modernize fleets, including incorpora\u0000ng alterna\u0000ve fuels capability,\nwhich should drive expanded OEM and service opportuni\u0000es, as mul\u0000-fuel engines contain more of our content.\nOil and Gas – During fiscal year 2024, we experienced decreased demand due to decreased domes\u0000c rig counts and the decrease in global oil and gas\nprices. We expect market share gains by our customers and increased scope on the next genera\u0000on reciproca\u0000ng engines as energy policies in some countries\nencourage the use of compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and other alterna\u0000ve fuels over carbon-rich petroleum fuels, which we expect will drive\nincreased demand for our alterna\u0000ve fuel clean engine control technologies. Addi\u0000onally, due to increased demand for fuel flexibility as well as natural gas\nprice variability and global supply chain disrup\u0000ons, power plant opera\u0000ons have transi\u0000oned to higher dual fuel use, thereby increasing the demand for our\nliquid fuel system and related products.\n26\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancial Highlights\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet sales:\nAerospace segment $ 2,028,618 $ 1,768,103\nIndustrial segment 1,295,631 1,146,463\nConsolidated net sales $ 3,324,249 $ 2,914,566\nEarnings:\nAerospace segment $ 385,360 $ 290,104\nSegment earnings as a percent of segment net sales 19.0% 16.4%\nIndustrial segment $ 229,857 $ 161,622\nSegment earnings as a percent of segment net sales 17.7% 14.1%\nConsolidated net earnings $ 372,971 $ 232,368\nAdjusted net earnings $ 379,136 $ 258,576\nEffec\u0000ve tax rate 17.8% 15.7%\nAdjusted effec\u0000ve tax rate 18.0% 16.8%\nConsolidated diluted earnings per share $ 6.01 $ 3.78\nConsolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 6.11 $ 4.21\nEarnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") $ 495,472 $ 320,915\nAdjusted EBIT $ 503,615 $ 355,791\nEarnings before interest, taxes, deprecia\u0000on, and amor\u0000za\u0000on (\"EBITDA\") $ 611,642 $ 440,658\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 619,785 $ 475,534\nAdjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted effec\u0000ve tax rate, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow, are non-\nU.S. GAAP financial measures. A descrip\u0000on of these measures as well as a reconcilia\u0000on of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to the closest U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measures can be found under the cap\u0000on “Non-U.S. GAAP Measures” in this Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condi\u0000ons\nand Results of Opera\u0000ons.\nLiquidity Highlights\nNet cash provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es for fiscal year 2024 was $439,089, compared to $308,543 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in net cash provided\nby opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily a\u0000ributable to increased earnings and improved working capital.\nFor fiscal year 2024, free cash flow was $342,809, compared to $232,043 for fiscal year 2023. We define free cash flow as net cash flows from opera\u0000ng\nac\u0000vi\u0000es less payments for property, plant, and equipment. The increase in free cash flow for fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily\ndue to increased earnings and improved working capital, par\u0000ally offset by higher capital expenditures.\nAt September 30, 2024, we held $282,270 in cash and cash equivalents and had total outstanding debt of $872,470 with addi\u0000onal borrowing\navailability of $775,136, net of outstanding le\u0000ers of credit, under our revolving credit agreement. At September 30, 2024, we also had addi\u0000onal borrowing\ncapacity of $19,771 under various foreign lines of credit and foreign overdra\u0000 facili\u0000es.\n27\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings and Other Selected Financial Data\nThe following table sets forth consolidated statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales for each period indicated:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 % of Net Sales 2023 % of Net Sales\nNet sales $ 3,324,249 100% $ 2,914,566 100%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of goods sold 2,447,770 73.6 2,236,983 76.8\nSelling, general, and administra\u0000ve expenses 307,499 9.3 269,692 9.3\nResearch and development costs 140,676 4.2 132,095 4.5\nRestructuring charges — — 5,172 0.2\nInterest expense 47,959 1.4 47,898 1.6\nInterest income (6,458) (0.2) (2,751) (0.1)\nOther (income) expense, net (67,168) (2.0) (50,291) (1.7)\nTotal costs and expenses 2,870,278 86.3 2,638,798 90.5\nEarnings before income taxes 453,971 13.7 275,768 9.5\nIncome tax expense 81,000 2.4 43,400 1.5\nNet earnings $ 372,971 11.2 $ 232,368 8.0\nOther select financial data:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nWorking capital $ 820,101 $ 852,256\nTotal debt 872,470 721,526\nTotal stockholders' equity 2,176,416 2,070,989\n2024 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2024 Net Sales Compared to 2023\nConsolidated net sales for fiscal year 2024 increased by $409,683, or 14.1%, compared to fiscal year 2023.\nDetails of the changes in consolidated net sales are as follows:\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended September 30, 2023 $ 2,914,566\nAerospace volume 126,480\nIndustrial volume 71,521\nEffects of changes in price 214,682\nEffects of changes in foreign currency rates (3,000)\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended September 30, 2024 $ 3,324,249\nIn the Aerospace segment, the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily a\u0000ributable to price realiza\u0000on, as\nwell as increases in both commercial and defense a\u0000ermarket due to higher aircra\u0000 u\u0000liza\u0000on.\nIn the Industrial segment, the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily a\u0000ributable to growth in\ntransporta\u0000on, par\u0000cularly in the on-highway natural gas truck business in China, price realiza\u0000on, and strong sales in power genera\u0000on, par\u0000ally offset by a\ndecrease in oil and gas sales.\n2024 Costs and Expenses Compared to 2023\nCost of goods sold increased by $210,787 to $2,447,770 for fiscal year 2024, from $2,236,983 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in cost of goods sold on\nan absolute basis in fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher sales volume and net infla\u0000onary impacts on material and\nlabor costs.\nGross margin (as measured by net sales less cost of goods sold, divided by net sales) was 26.4% for fiscal year 2024, compared to 23.2% for fiscal year\n2023. The increase in gross margin for fiscal year 2024 is primarily a\u0000ributable to price realiza\u0000on and higher sales volume, par\u0000ally offset by net infla\u0000onary\nimpacts on material and labor.\nSelling, general and administra\u0000ve expenses increased by $37,807, or 14.0%, to $307,499 for fiscal year 2024, compared to $269,692 for fiscal year\n2023. Selling, general, and administra\u0000ve expenses as a percentage of net sales were flat at 9.3% for fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. The increase in\nselling, general, and administra\u0000ve expenses on an\n28\nabsolute basis for fiscal year 2024 as compared to prior fiscal year is primarily due to increased members, increased annual variable incen\u0000ve compensa\u0000on\ncosts, and increased expenses rela\u0000ng to business development ac\u0000vi\u0000es.\nResearch and development costs increased by $8,581, or 6.5%, to $140,676 for fiscal year 2024, as compared to $132,095 for fiscal year 2023. The\nincrease in research and development costs on an absolute basis for fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily due to variability in the\n\u0000ming of projects and expenses. Research and development costs as a percentage of net sales decreased to 4.2% for fiscal year 2024, as compared to 4.5% for\nfiscal year 2023. The decrease in research and development costs as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year is\nprimarily due to net sales increases in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. Our research and development ac\u0000vi\u0000es extend across both our opera\u0000ng\nsegments and almost all of our customer base, and we an\u0000cipate ongoing variability in research and development costs due to the \u0000ming of customer business\nneeds on current and future programs.\nInterest expense remained flat at $47,959, or 1.4% of net sales for fiscal year 2024, compared to $47,898 or 1.6% of net sales for fiscal year 2023.\nInterest expense remained flat for fiscal year 2024 primarily due to consistent borrowings and interest rates on our revolving credit agreement as compared to\nthe prior fiscal year.\nOther income, net was $67,168 for fiscal year 2024, compared to $50,291 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in other income in fiscal year 2024 compared\nto fiscal year 2023 was primarily a\u0000ributable to increased earnings of the JV and a non-recurring gain related to a previous acquisi\u0000on that was recognized\nduring the current fiscal year.\nIncome taxes were provided at an effec\u0000ve rate on earnings before income taxes of 17.8% for fiscal year 2024, compared to 15.7% for fiscal year 2023.\nThe increase in the effec\u0000ve tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily a\u0000ributable to a smaller research and development credit,\nsmaller net excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensa\u0000on as a percent of current year earnings, fewer resolu\u0000ons of tax items with taxing\nauthori\u0000es, and increased return to provision items, par\u0000ally offset by smaller current fiscal year projected future withholding taxes on unremi\u0000ed earnings.\nSegment Results\nThe following table presents sales by segment:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet sales:\nAerospace $ 2,028,618 61.0% $ 1,768,103 60.7%\nIndustrial 1,295,631 39.0% 1,146,463 39.3%\nConsolidated net sales $ 3,324,249 100% $ 2,914,566 100%\nThe following table presents earnings by segment and reconciles segment earnings to consolidated net earnings:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nAerospace $ 385,360 $ 290,104\nIndustrial 229,857 161,622\nNonsegment expenses (119,745) (130,811)\nInterest expense, net (41,501) (45,147)\nConsolidated earnings before income taxes 453,971 275,768\nIncome tax expense 81,000 43,400\nConsolidated net earnings $ 372,971 $ 232,368\nThe following table presents segment earnings as a percent of segment net sales:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nAerospace 19.0% 16.4%\nIndustrial 17.7% 14.1%\n29\n2024 Segment Results Compared to 2023\nAerospace\nAerospace segment net sales increased by $260,515, or 14.7% to $2,028,618 for fiscal year 2024, compared to $1,768,103 for fiscal year 2023. Segment\nnet sales increased for fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 primarily due to price realiza\u0000on and increases in both commercial and defense\na\u0000ermarket volumes due to higher aircra\u0000 u\u0000liza\u0000on.\nDefense OEM sales increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to prior fiscal year, primarily driven by the increased demand for smart defense. Our defense\na\u0000ermarket sales increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by increased output and supply chain stabiliza\u0000on.\nAerospace segment earnings increased by $95,256, or 32.8%, to $385,360 for fiscal year 2024, compared to $290,104 for fiscal year 2023.\nThe net increase in Aerospace segment earnings for fiscal year 2024 was due to the following:\nEarnings for the period ended September 30, 2023 $ 290,104\nSales volume 49,469\nPrice, sales mix, infla\u0000on, and produc\u0000vity 62,989\nOther, net (17,202)\nEarnings for the period ended September 30, 2024 $ 385,360\nAerospace segment earnings as a percentage of segment net sales were 19.0% for fiscal year 2024 and 16.4% for fiscal year 2023.\nIndustrial\nIndustrial segment net sales increased by $149,168, or 13.0%, to $1,295,631 for fiscal year 2024, compared to $1,146,463 for fiscal year 2023. The\nincrease in Industrial segment net sales in fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily a\u0000ributable to growth in transporta\u0000on,\npar\u0000cularly in the on-highway natural gas truck business in China, price realiza\u0000on, and strong sales in power genera\u0000on, par\u0000ally offset by a decrease in oil\nand gas sales.\nIndustrial segment earnings increased by $68,235, or 42.2%, to $229,857 for fiscal year 2024, compared to $161,622 for fiscal year 2023.\nThe net increase in Industrial segment earnings for fiscal year 2024 was due to the following:\nEarnings for the period ended September 30, 2023 $ 161,622\nSales volume 17,281\nPrice, sales mix, infla\u0000on, and produc\u0000vity 72,197\nOther, net (21,243)\nEarnings for the period ended September 30, 2024 $ 229,857\nIndustrial segment earnings as a percentage of segment net sales were 17.7% for fiscal year 2024, compared to 14.1% for fiscal year 2023. Industrial\nearnings in fiscal year 2024 benefited significantly from increases in transporta\u0000on due to increased demand for on-highway natural gas trucks in China, as well\nas opera\u0000onal improvements including increased output and other efficiency gains.\nWe expect significant sales and earnings decreases in our China on-highway natural gas truck business in fiscal year 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024\ndue to the deteriora\u0000ng local Chinese economy, a narrower natural gas to diesel spread, and elevated customer inventory levels. Future demand remains\nuncertain due to the vola\u0000lity of this business.\nNonsegment\nNonsegment expenses decreased by $11,066 to $119,745 for fiscal year 2024, compared to $130,811 for fiscal year 2023. The decrease in nonsegment\nexpenses is primarily due to significant costs that occurred in fiscal year 2023 that did not reoccur in fiscal year 2024.\n30\nThe significant costs that impacted nonsegment expense are as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNonsegment expenses $ (119,745) $ (130,811)\nNon-recurring gain related to a previous acquisi\u0000on (4,803) —\nBusiness development ac\u0000vi\u0000es 5,902 —\nNon-recurring charge related to a previous acquisi\u0000on 4,378 —\nCertain non-restructuring separa\u0000on costs 2,666 2,208\nSpecific charge for excess and obsolete inventory — 11,995\nProduct ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on — 10,504\nRestructuring charges — 5,172\nNon-recurring charge related to customer collec\u0000ons — 4,997\nNonsegment expenses excluding infrequent significant charges $ (111,602) $ (95,935)\nExcluding these charges in the above table, nonsegment expenses increased $15,667 in fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily\ndue to increased annual variable incen\u0000ve compensa\u0000on costs.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, we have sa\u0000sfied our working capital needs, as well as capital expenditures, product development and other liquidity requirements\nassociated with our opera\u0000ons, with cash flow provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es and borrowings under our credit facili\u0000es. We have also issued debt to\nsupplement our cash needs, repay our other indebtedness, or finance our acquisi\u0000ons. We expect that cash generated from our opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es, together\nwith borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to fund our con\u0000nuing opera\u0000ng needs for the next 12\nmonths and the foreseeable future.\nOur total cash and cash equivalents were $282,270 at September 30, 2024 and $137,447 at September 30, 2023, and our working capital was $820,101\nat September 30, 2024 and $852,256 at September 30, 2023. Of the cash and cash equivalents held at September 30, 2024, $279,070 was held by our foreign\nloca\u0000ons. We are not presently aware of any significant restric\u0000ons on the repatria\u0000on of these funds, although a por\u0000on is considered indefinitely reinvested\nin certain foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed to fund our opera\u0000ons or sa\u0000sfy obliga\u0000ons in the United States, then they could be repatriated and\ntheir repatria\u0000on into the United States may cause us to incur addi\u0000onal U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. Any addi\u0000onal U.S. taxes could be\noffset, in part or in whole, by foreign tax credits. The amount of such taxes and applica\u0000on of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and\nother circumstances at the \u0000me these amounts are repatriated. Based on these variables, it is imprac\u0000cal to determine the income tax liability that might be\nincurred if these funds were to be repatriated.\nOur revolving credit facility, as amended, provides a borrowing capacity of up to $1,000,000 with the op\u0000on to increase total available borrowings to up\nto $1,500,000, subject to lenders’ par\u0000cipa\u0000on. We can borrow against our revolving credit facility as long as we are in compliance with all of our debt\ncovenants. We believe we were in compliance with all our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility can be\nmade in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar provided that the U.S. dollar equivalent of any foreign currency borrowings and U.S.\ndollar borrowings does not, in total, exceed the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility. Historically, we have used borrowings under our revolving\ncredit facili\u0000es to meet certain short-term working capital needs, as well as for strategic uses, including repurchases of our common stock, payments of\ndividends, acquisi\u0000ons, and facility expansions.\nIn addi\u0000on to our revolving credit facility, we have various foreign credit facili\u0000es, some of which are \u0000ed to net amounts on deposit at certain foreign\nfinancial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons. These foreign credit facili\u0000es are reviewed annually for renewal. We use borrowings under these foreign credit facili\u0000es to finance certain\nlocal opera\u0000ons on a periodic basis. For further discussion of our revolving credit facility and our other credit facili\u0000es, see Note 15, Credit facili\u0000es, short-term\nborrowings, and long-term debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had total outstanding debt of $872,470 consis\u0000ng of various series of unsecured notes due between 2025 and 2033, and\namounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility, and our finance leases.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had addi\u0000onal borrowing availability of $775,136 under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding le\u0000ers of credit, and\naddi\u0000onal borrowing availability of $19,771 under various foreign credit facili\u0000es.\n31\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $217,000 outstanding amount borrowed under our revolving credit facility. Revolving credit facility and short-term\nborrowing ac\u0000vity during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nMaximum daily balance during the period $ 387,100\nAverage daily balance during the period $ 225,025\nWeighted average interest rate on average daily balance 5.96%\nWe believe we were in compliance with all our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. See Note 15, Credit facili\u0000es, short-term borrowings, and long-\nterm debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” for more informa\u0000on about our\ncovenants.\nOur ability to service our long-term debt, to remain in compliance with the various restric\u0000ons and covenants contained in our debt agreements, and to\nfund working capital, capital expenditures, and product development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es, which in turn\nis subject to, among other things, future opera\u0000ng performance as well as general economic, financial, compe\u0000\u0000ve, legisla\u0000ve, regulatory, and other\ncondi\u0000ons, some of which may be beyond our control.\nWe believe that cash flows from opera\u0000ons, along with our contractually commi\u0000ed borrowings and other borrowing capability, will con\u0000nue to be\nsufficient to fund an\u0000cipated capital spending requirements and our opera\u0000ons for the foreseeable future. However, we could be adversely affected if the\nfinancial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons providing our capital requirements refuse to honor their contractual commitments, cease lending, or declare bankruptcy. We believe the\nlending ins\u0000tu\u0000ons par\u0000cipa\u0000ng in our credit arrangements are financially stable.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es $ 439,089 $ 308,543\nNet cash used in inves\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es (89,217) (73,551)\nNet cash used in financing ac\u0000vi\u0000es (218,047) (196,473)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 12,998 (8,916)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents 144,823 29,603\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 137,447 107,844\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 282,270 $ 137,447\n2024 Cash Flows Compared to 2023\nNet cash flows provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es for fiscal year 2024 was $439,089, compared to $308,543 for fiscal year 2023. The increase in net cash\nprovided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily a\u0000ributable to increased earnings and improved working capital.\nNet cash flows used in inves\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es for fiscal year 2024 was $89,217, compared to $73,551 in fiscal year 2023. The increase in cash used in\ninves\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to increased payments for property, plant, and equipment.\nNet cash flows used in financing ac\u0000vi\u0000es for fiscal year 2024 was $218,047, compared to $196,473 in fiscal year 2023. The increase in net cash flows\nused in financing ac\u0000vi\u0000es in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was a\u0000ributable to the increase in repurchases of common stock par\u0000ally offset by\na change in net debt borrowings as compared to payments. During fiscal year 2024, we made $390,819 of cash repurchases of common stock, compared to\n$126,380 of cash repurchases of common stock during fiscal year 2023. During fiscal year 2024, we had net debt borrowings in the amount of $141,183,\ncompared to net debt payments in the amount of $67,579 in fiscal year 2023.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted effec\u0000ve tax rate, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow, are\nfinancial measures not prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, we believe these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide addi\u0000onal\ninforma\u0000on that enables readers to evaluate our business from the perspec\u0000ve of management.\nEarnings based non-U.S. GAAP financial measures\nAdjusted net earnings is defined by the Company as net earnings excluding, as applicable, (i) a non-recurring gain related to a previous acquisi\u0000on, (ii)\ncosts related to business development ac\u0000vi\u0000es, (iii) a non-recurring charge related to\n32\na previous acquisi\u0000on, (iv) certain non-restructuring separa\u0000on costs, (v) a specific charge for excess and obsolete inventory, (vi) product ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on, (vii) a\nnon-recurring charge related to customer collec\u0000ons, and (viii) restructuring charges. The product ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on adjustment pertains to a non-recurring write-\noff of inventory and assets related to the elimina\u0000on of certain product lines. The specific charge for excess and obsolete inventory pertains to a non-recurring\nprocess change that resulted in the iden\u0000fica\u0000on and write down of certain excess inventory unrelated to product ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on. The non-recurring charge\nrelated to customer collec\u0000ons pertains to a discrete process issue that was iden\u0000fied and corrected. The Company believes that these excluded items are\nshort-term in nature, not directly related to the ongoing opera\u0000ons of the business and therefore, the exclusion of them illustrates more clearly how the\nunderlying business of Woodward is performing. Management uses adjusted net earnings to evaluate the Company’s performance excluding these infrequent\nor unusual period expenses that are not necessarily indica\u0000ve of the Company’s opera\u0000ng performance for the period. Management defines adjusted earnings\nper share as adjusted net earnings, as defined above, divided by the weighted-average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding for the period.\nManagement uses both adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share when comparing opera\u0000ng performance to other periods which may not have\nsimilar infrequent or unusual charges.\nThe reconcilia\u0000on of net earnings and earnings per share to adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share, respec\u0000vely, for the fiscal years\nended and are shown in the table below:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nEarnings Per Earnings Per\nNet Earnings Share Net Earnings Share\nNet earnings (U.S. GAAP) $ 372,971 $ 6.01 $ 232,368 $ 3.78\nNon-U.S. GAAP adjustments, net of tax:\nNon-recurring gain related to a previous acquisi\u0000on (3,433) (0.06) — —\nBusiness development ac\u0000vi\u0000es 4,456 0.07 — —\nNon-recurring charge related to a previous acquisi\u0000on 3,129 0.05 — —\nCertain non-restructuring separa\u0000on costs 2,013 0.04 1,661 0.03\nSpecific charge for excess and obsolete inventory — — 9,016 0.15\nProduct ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on — — 7,896 0.13\nNon-recurring charge related to customer collec\u0000ons — — 3,761 0.06\nRestructuring charges — — 3,874 0.06\nTotal non-U.S. GAAP adjustments 6,165 0.10 26,208 0.43\nAdjusted net earnings (Non-U.S. GAAP) $ 379,136 $ 6.11 $ 258,576 $ 4.21\nManagement uses EBIT to evaluate our performance without financing and tax related considera\u0000ons, as these elements may not fluctuate with\nopera\u0000ng results. Management uses EBITDA in evalua\u0000ng our opera\u0000ng performance, making business decisions, including developing budgets, managing\nexpenditures, forecas\u0000ng future periods, and evalua\u0000ng capital structure impacts of various strategic scenarios. Securi\u0000es analysts, investors and others\nfrequently use EBIT and EBITDA in their evalua\u0000on of companies, par\u0000cularly those with significant property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets\nsubject to amor\u0000za\u0000on. The Company believes that EBIT and EBITDA are useful measures to the investor when measuring opera\u0000ng performance as they\neliminate the impact of financing and tax expenses, which are non-opera\u0000ng expenses and may be driven by factors outside of our opera\u0000ons, such as changes\nin tax laws or regula\u0000ons, and, in the case of EBITDA, the noncash charges associated with deprecia\u0000on and amor\u0000za\u0000on. Further, as interest from financing,\nincome taxes, deprecia\u0000on, and amor\u0000za\u0000on can vary drama\u0000cally between companies and between periods, management believes that the removal of these\nitems can improve comparability.\nAdjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA represent further non-U.S. GAAP adjustments to EBIT and EBITDA, in each case adjusted to exclude, as applicable, (i)\na non-recurring gain related to a previous acquisi\u0000on, (ii) costs related to business development ac\u0000vi\u0000es, (iii) a non-recurring charge related to a previous\nacquisi\u0000on, (iv) certain non-restructuring separa\u0000on costs, (v) a specific charge for excess and obsolete inventory, (vi) product ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on, (vii) a non-\nrecurring charge related to customer collec\u0000ons, and (viii) restructuring charges. The product ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on adjustment pertains to a non-recurring write-off\nof inventory and assets related to the elimina\u0000on of certain product lines. The specific charge for excess and obsolete inventory pertains to a non-recurring\nprocess change that resulted in the iden\u0000fica\u0000on and write down of certain excess inventory unrelated to product ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on. The non-recurring charge\nrelated to customer collec\u0000ons pertains to a discrete process issue that was iden\u0000fied and corrected. As these charges are infrequent or unusual items that can\nbe variable from period to period and do not fluctuate with opera\u0000ng results, management believes that by removing\n33\nthese gains and charges from EBIT and EBITDA it improves comparability of past, present, and future opera\u0000ng results and provides consistency when\ncomparing EBIT and EBITDA between periods.\nEBIT and adjusted EBIT reconciled to net earnings were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet earnings (U.S. GAAP) $ 372,971 $ 232,368\nIncome tax expense 81,000 43,400\nInterest expense 47,959 47,898\nInterest income (6,458) (2,751)\nEBIT (Non-U.S. GAAP) 495,472 320,915\nNon-U.S. GAAP adjustments:\nNon-recurring gain related to a previous acquisi\u0000on (4,803) —\nBusiness development ac\u0000vi\u0000es 5,902 —\nNon-recurring charge related to a previous acquisi\u0000on 4,378 —\nCertain non-restructuring separa\u0000on costs 2,666 2,208\nSpecific charge for excess and obsolete inventory — 11,995\nProduct ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on — 10,504\nNon-recurring charge related to customer collec\u0000ons — 4,997\nRestructuring charges — 5,172\nTotal non-U.S. GAAP adjustments 8,143 34,876\nAdjusted EBIT (Non-U.S. GAAP) $ 503,615 $ 355,791\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA reconciled to net earnings were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet earnings (U.S. GAAP) $ 372,971 $ 232,368\nIncome tax expense 81,000 43,400\nInterest expense 47,959 47,898\nInterest income (6,458) (2,751)\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on of intangible assets 33,592 37,589\nDeprecia\u0000on expense 82,578 82,154\nEBITDA (Non-U.S. GAAP) 611,642 440,658\nNon-U.S. GAAP adjustments:\nNon-recurring gain related to a previous acquisi\u0000on (4,803) —\nBusiness development ac\u0000vi\u0000es 5,902 —\nNon-recurring charge related to a previous acquisi\u0000on 4,378 —\nCertain non-restructuring separa\u0000on costs 2,666 2,208\nSpecific charge for excess and obsolete inventory — 11,995\nProduct ra\u0000onaliza\u0000on — 10,504\nNon-recurring charge related to customer collec\u0000ons — 4,997\nRestructuring charges — 5,172\nTotal non-U.S. GAAP adjustments 8,143 34,876\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-U.S. GAAP) $ 619,785 $ 475,534\nThe use of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isola\u0000on of, or as a subs\u0000tute for, the financial informa\u0000on\nprepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share, adjusted effec\u0000ve tax rate, EBIT, adjusted\nEBIT, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA exclude certain financial informa\u0000on compared with net earnings, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, users\nof this financial informa\u0000on should consider the informa\u0000on that is excluded. Our calcula\u0000ons of adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share, EBIT,\nadjusted EBIT, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly \u0000tled measures used by other companies, limi\u0000ng their usefulness as compara\u0000ve\nmeasures.\nCash flow-based non-U.S. GAAP financial measures\nManagement uses free cash flow, which is defined by the Company as net cash flows provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es less payments for property, plant,\nand equipment, in reviewing the financial performance of and cash genera\u0000on by Woodward’s various business groups and evalua\u0000ng cash levels. We believe\nfree cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to grow organically and generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as\npaying interest on our indebtedness, repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisi\u0000ons, inves\u0000ng in research and\n34\ndevelopment, purchasing our common stock, and paying dividends. In addi\u0000on, securi\u0000es analysts, investors, and others frequently use free cash flow in their\nevalua\u0000on of companies.\nThe use of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isola\u0000on of, or as subs\u0000tutes for, the financial informa\u0000on prepared\nand presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discre\u0000onary use and are not necessarily a\nmeasure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Our calcula\u0000on of free cash flow may differ from similarly \u0000tled measures used by other companies, limi\u0000ng\ntheir usefulness as a compara\u0000ve measure.\nFree cash flow was as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es (U.S. GAAP) $ 439,089 $ 308,543\nPayments for property, plant and equipment (96,280) (76,500)\nFree cash flow (Non-U.S. GAAP) $ 342,809 $ 232,043\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe prepara\u0000on of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assump\u0000ons, and\nes\u0000mates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Opera\u0000ons and summary of significant\naccoun\u0000ng policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accoun\u0000ng policies and methods used in the prepara\u0000on of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons described below are those that we consider to be most cri\u0000cal to an understanding of our\nfinancial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertain\u0000es. All of these es\u0000mates reflect our best judgment about current, and for\nsome es\u0000mates, future economic and market condi\u0000ons, and their effects based on informa\u0000on available as of the date of these financial statements. As\nes\u0000mates are updated or actual amounts are known, our cri\u0000cal accoun\u0000ng es\u0000mates are revised, and opera\u0000ng results may be affected by the revised\nes\u0000mates. Actual results may differ from these es\u0000mates under different assump\u0000ons or condi\u0000ons.\nOur management has discussed the development and selec\u0000on of these cri\u0000cal accoun\u0000ng es\u0000mates with the Audit Commi\u0000ee of our Board of\nDirectors, and the Audit Commi\u0000ee has reviewed our disclosures in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nRevenue recogni\u0000on\nRevenue is recognized on contracts with customers for arrangements in which quan\u0000\u0000es and pricing are fixed and/or determinable and are generally\nbased on customer purchase orders, o\u0000en within the framework of a long-term supply arrangement with the customer. We recognize revenue for\nperformance obliga\u0000ons within a customer contract when control of the associated product or service is transferred to the customer. Some of our contracts\nwith customers contain a single performance obliga\u0000on, while other contracts contain mul\u0000ple performance obliga\u0000ons. Each product within a contract\ngenerally represents a separate performance obliga\u0000on as we do not provide significant installa\u0000on and integra\u0000on services, the products do not customize\neach other, and the products can func\u0000on independently of each other.\nA contract's transac\u0000on price is allocated to each performance obliga\u0000on and recognized as revenue when, or as, the customer obtains control of the\nassociated product or service. When there are mul\u0000ple performance obliga\u0000ons within a contract, we generally use the observable standalone sales price for\neach dis\u0000nct product or service within the contract to allocate the transac\u0000on price to the dis\u0000nct products or services. In instances when a standalone sales\nprice for each product or service is not observable within the contract, we allocate the transac\u0000on price to each performance obliga\u0000on using an es\u0000mate of\nthe standalone selling price for each product or service, which is generally based on incurred costs plus a reasonable margin, for each dis\u0000nct product or\nservice in the contract.\nWhen determining the transac\u0000on price of each contract, we consider contractual considera\u0000on payable by the customer and variable considera\u0000on\nthat may affect the total transac\u0000on price. Variable considera\u0000on, consis\u0000ng of early payment discounts, rebates, and other sources of price variability, are\nincluded in the es\u0000mated transac\u0000on price based on both customer-specific informa\u0000on as well as historical experience. We regularly review our es\u0000mates of\nvariable considera\u0000on on the transac\u0000on price and recognize changes in es\u0000mates on a cumula\u0000ve catch-up basis as if the most current es\u0000mate of the\ntransac\u0000on price adjusted for variable considera\u0000on had been known as of the incep\u0000on of the contract.\n35\nPoint in \u0000me and over \u0000me revenue recogni\u0000on\nControl of the products generally transfers to the customer at a point in \u0000me, if the customer does not control the products as they are produced. We\nexercise judgment and consider the \u0000ming of right of payment, transfer of the risk and rewards, transfers of \u0000tle, transfer of physical possession, and customer\nacceptance when determining when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon shipment of products. Performance obliga\u0000ons are\nsa\u0000sfied and revenue is recognized over \u0000me if: (i) the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being\nenhanced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alterna\u0000ve use to us; and (ii) we have an enforceable right to payment with a profit. When\nservices are provided, revenue from those services is recognized over \u0000me because control is transferred con\u0000nuously to customers as we perform the work.\nFor services that are not short-term in nature, manufacturing, repair, and overhaul (“MRO”), and sales of products that have no alterna\u0000ve use to us and\nan enforceable right to payment with a profit, we use an actual cost input measure to determine the extent of progress towards comple\u0000on of the\nperformance obliga\u0000on. For these revenue streams, revenue is recognized over \u0000me as work is performed based on the rela\u0000onship between actual costs\nincurred to-date for each contract and the total es\u0000mated costs for such contract at comple\u0000on of the performance obliga\u0000on (the cost-to-cost method). We\nhave concluded that this measure of progress best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, because incurred costs are integral to our comple\u0000on of the\nperformance obliga\u0000on under the specific customer contract and correlate directly to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor,\nmaterial, and overhead. Contract cost es\u0000mates are based on various assump\u0000ons to project the outcome of future events. These assump\u0000ons include labor\nproduc\u0000vity, and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the\navailability and \u0000ming of funding from the customer. Revenues, including es\u0000mated fees or profits, are recorded propor\u0000onally as costs are incurred.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost is determined using methods that approximate the first-in, first-out\nbasis. We include product costs, labor, and related fixed and variable overhead in the cost of inventories. Inventory net realizable values are determined by\ngiving substan\u0000al considera\u0000on to the expected product selling price. We es\u0000mate expected selling prices based on our historical recovery rates, general\neconomic, and market condi\u0000ons, the expected channel of disposi\u0000on, and current customer contracts and preferences. Actual results may differ from our\nes\u0000mates due to changes in resale or market value and the mix of these factors.\nWe monitor inventory for events or circumstances, such as nega\u0000ve margins, recent sales history sugges\u0000ng lower sales value, or changes in customer\npreferences, which would indicate the net realizable value of inventory is less than the carrying value of inventory, and management records adjustments as\nnecessary. When inventory is wri\u0000en down below cost, such reduced amount is considered the cost for subsequent accoun\u0000ng purposes. Our recording of\ninventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value has not historically required material adjustments once ini\u0000ally established.\nThe carrying value of inventory was $609,092 at September 30, 2024 and $517,843 at September 30, 2023. If economic condi\u0000ons, customer product\nrequirements, or other factors significantly reduce future customer demand for our products from forecast levels, then future adjustments to the carrying\nvalue of inventory may become necessary. We a\u0000empt to maintain inventory quan\u0000\u0000es at levels considered necessary to fill firm and expected orders in a\nreasonable \u0000me frame, which we believe mi\u0000gates our exposure to future inventory carrying cost adjustments.\nReviews for impairment of goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets\nGoodwill\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $806,643 of goodwill represen\u0000ng approximately 18% of our total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the\nrepor\u0000ng unit level on an annual basis and more o\u0000en if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a repor\u0000ng unit may be below\nits carrying amount.\nThe iden\u0000fica\u0000on of repor\u0000ng units and considera\u0000on of the aggrega\u0000on of components into a single repor\u0000ng unit under U.S. GAAP requires\nmanagement judgment. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of repor\u0000ng units, determined using discounted cash flows, with their\ncarrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the repor\u0000ng unit exceeds its fair value, we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its\ncarrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying\namount to its implied fair value.\n36\nDuring the fourth quarter, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2024 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The\nresults of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of July 31, 2024, indicated the es\u0000mated fair value of each repor\u0000ng unit was in excess of its\ncarrying value, and accordingly, no impairment existed.\nIndefinitely lived intangible asset\nWe have one indefinitely lived intangible asset consis\u0000ng of the Woodward L’Orange trade name. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the\nWoodward L’Orange trade name intangible asset was $64,751, represen\u0000ng approximately 1% of our total assets. The Woodward L’Orange trade name\nintangible asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more o\u0000en if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the\nWoodward L’Orange intangible asset may be below its carrying amount. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the Woodward L’Orange\ntrade name intangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach, with its carrying\namount. If the carrying amount of the Woodward L’Orange trade name intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to\nreduce the carrying amount to its fair value. We have not recorded any impairment charges associated with the indefinitely lived intangible asset.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we completed the annual impairment test, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, of the Woodward L’Orange trade\nname intangible asset as of July 31, 2024. The results of the annual impairment test performed as of July 31, 2024 indicated the es\u0000mated fair value of the\nWoodward L’Orange trade name intangible asset was in excess of its carrying value, and accordingly, no impairment existed.\nAs part of our ongoing monitoring efforts to assess goodwill and the Woodward L’Orange trade name indefinite lived asset for possible indica\u0000ons of\nimpairment, we will con\u0000nue to consider a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to the global economic environment and its poten\u0000al impact on\nour business. There can be no assurance that our es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons regarding forecasted cash flows of certain repor\u0000ng units or the Woodward\nL’Orange business, the current economic environment, or the other inputs used in forecas\u0000ng the present value of forecasted cash flows will prove to be\naccurate projec\u0000ons of future performance.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdic\u0000ons. Significant judgment is required in evalua\u0000ng our tax posi\u0000ons\nand determining our provision for income taxes.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, there are many transac\u0000ons and calcula\u0000ons for which the ul\u0000mate tax determina\u0000on is uncertain. We establish\nreserves for tax-related uncertain\u0000es based on es\u0000mates of whether, and the extent to which, addi\u0000onal taxes will be due. The reserves are established when\nwe believe that certain posi\u0000ons are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax authori\u0000es. We adjust these reserves in light of\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of an es\u0000mate. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no\nassurance can be given that the final outcome of these ma\u0000ers will be consistent with what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. To\nthe extent that the final tax outcome of these ma\u0000ers is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the current provision for income\ntaxes.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valua\u0000on allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The determina\u0000on of the amount of\nvalua\u0000on allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves es\u0000mates regarding the \u0000ming and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary\ndifferences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies. A valua\u0000on allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if,\nbased upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valua\u0000on\nallowance, we consider all available evidence including past opera\u0000ng results, es\u0000mates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.\nChanges in the relevant facts can significantly impact the judgment or need for valua\u0000on allowances. In the event we change our determina\u0000on as to the\namount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valua\u0000on allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the\nperiod in which such determina\u0000on is made.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to vola\u0000lity and could be affected by earnings that are different than those an\u0000cipated in countries which have\nlower or higher tax rates; by transfer pricing adjustments; and/or changes in tax laws, regula\u0000ons, and accoun\u0000ng principles, including accoun\u0000ng for uncertain\ntax posi\u0000ons, or interpreta\u0000ons thereof. There can be no assurance that these items will remain stable over \u0000me. Addi\u0000onally, we record through income tax\nexpense all future excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from stock op\u0000ons exercised. This creates unpredictable vola\u0000lity in the effec\u0000ve tax rate because\nthe addi\u0000onal expense or benefit recognized each quarter is based on the \u0000ming of the employee’s elec\u0000on to exercise any vested stock op\u0000ons outstanding,\nwhich is outside our control, and the market price of our shares at the \u0000me of exercise, which is subject to market vola\u0000lity.\n37\nOur effec\u0000ve tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign opera\u0000ons, adjustments of valua\u0000on allowances,\nresearch tax credits, state taxes, and tax audit se\u0000lements. In addi\u0000on to poten\u0000al local country tax law and policy changes that could impact the provision for\nincome taxes, management’s judgment about and inten\u0000ons concerning the repatria\u0000on of foreign earnings could also significantly impact the provision for\nincome taxes. Management reassesses its judgment regularly, taking into considera\u0000on the poten\u0000al tax impacts of these judgments, and inten\u0000ons.\nThe Organiza\u0000on for Economic Coopera\u0000on and Development (\"OECD\") introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shi\u0000ing Pillar Two rules that impose a global\nminimum tax rate of 15%. Numerous countries have enacted or are expected to enact legisla\u0000on to be effec\u0000ve for Woodward as early as October 1, 2024,\nwith general implementa\u0000on of a global minimum tax for Woodward by October 1, 2025. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules. We\ndo not expect a material impact to our effec\u0000ve tax rate or cash flows based on currently enacted legisla\u0000on and will con\u0000nue to closely monitor evolving\nlegisla\u0000on and guidance that could change our current assessment.\n38\nItem 7A. Quan\u0000ta\u0000ve and Qualita\u0000ve Disclosures About Market Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we have exposures to interest rate risk from our long-term and short-term debt and our postre\u0000rement benefit plans,\nand foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign opera\u0000ons and foreign currency transac\u0000ons.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk, Interest Rate Risk, and Related Hedging Ac\u0000vi\u0000es\nWe are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates when we sell product in currencies different from the currency in which product and\nmanufacturing costs were incurred. The func\u0000onal currencies and our purchasing and sales ac\u0000vi\u0000es primarily include USD, EUR, RMB, JPY, and GBP. We may\nalso be impacted by changes in the rela\u0000ve buying power of our customers, which may impact sales volumes either posi\u0000vely or nega\u0000vely. As these\ncurrencies fluctuate against each other, and other currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on sales, purchasing transac\u0000ons, and\nlabor. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is reduced through the maintenance of local produc\u0000on facili\u0000es in the markets we serve, which we believe creates a\nnatural hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure.\nThe percentages of our net sales denominated in a currency other than the USD were as follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nFunc\u0000onal currency:\nEUR 14.1% 14.8%\nRMB 8.7% 6.3%\nJPY 2.3% 2.4%\nGBP 2.0% 2.1%\nAll other foreign currencies 2.7% 2.9%\n29.8% 28.5%\nCurrency exchange rates vary daily and o\u0000en one currency strengthens against the USD while another currency weakens. Because of the complex\ninterrela\u0000onship of our worldwide supply chains and distribu\u0000on channels, it is difficult to quan\u0000fy the impact of a par\u0000cular change in exchange rates.\nWe use deriva\u0000ve instruments as risk management tools that involve complexity and are not used for trading or specula\u0000ve purposes. From \u0000me to\n\u0000me, we will enter into a foreign currency exchange rate contract to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on liabili\u0000es expected to be\nse\u0000led at a future date. Market risk arises from the poten\u0000al adverse effects on the value of deriva\u0000ve instruments that result from a change in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. We minimize this market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types of, and degree to which we enter into,\nderiva\u0000ve instruments. We enter into deriva\u0000ve instruments for risk management purposes only. We do not enter into or issue deriva\u0000ves for trading or\nspecula\u0000ve purposes. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no open foreign currency exchange rate contracts and all previous exchange rate deriva\u0000ve\ninstruments were se\u0000led or terminated.\nFor more informa\u0000on on deriva\u0000ve instruments, see Note 8, Deriva\u0000ve instruments and hedging ac\u0000vi\u0000es, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nOur reported financial results of opera\u0000ons, including the reported value of our assets and liabili\u0000es, are also impacted by changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates. The assets and liabili\u0000es of substan\u0000ally all of our subsidiaries outside the United States are translated at period end rates of exchange for each\nrepor\u0000ng period. Earnings and cash flow statements are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange. Although these transla\u0000on changes have no\nimmediate cash impact, the transla\u0000on changes may impact future borrowing capacity, debt covenants, and the overall value of our net assets. In addi\u0000on, we\nalso have assets and liabili\u0000es, specifically accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current inter-company receivables and payables, whose carrying\namounts approximate their fair value, which are denominated in currencies other than their relevant func\u0000onal currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate risk\nis mi\u0000gated through several means, including the invoicing of customers in the same currency as the source of the products, and the prompt se\u0000lement of\ninter-company balances u\u0000lizing a global ne\u0000ng system.\n39\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Woodward, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Repor\u0000ng\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Woodward, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the\nrelated consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and the related notes (collec\u0000vely referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial repor\u0000ng as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Commi\u0000ee of\nSponsoring Organiza\u0000ons of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial posi\u0000on of the Company as of September 30,\n2024 and 2023, and the results of its opera\u0000ons and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with\naccoun\u0000ng principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effec\u0000ve\ninternal control over financial repor\u0000ng as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nCOSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effec\u0000ve internal control over financial repor\u0000ng, and for its\nassessment of the effec\u0000veness of internal control over financial repor\u0000ng, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control\nover Financial Repor\u0000ng. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial repor\u0000ng based on our audits. We are a public accoun\u0000ng firm registered with the Public Company Accoun\u0000ng Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securi\u0000es laws and the applicable rules and\nregula\u0000ons of the Securi\u0000es and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effec\u0000ve internal control\nover financial repor\u0000ng was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evalua\u0000ng the accoun\u0000ng principles used and significant es\u0000mates made by management, as\nwell as evalua\u0000ng the overall presenta\u0000on of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial repor\u0000ng included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial repor\u0000ng, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and tes\u0000ng and evalua\u0000ng the design and\nopera\u0000ng effec\u0000veness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary\nin the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefini\u0000on and Limita\u0000ons of Internal Control over Financial Repor\u0000ng\nA company’s internal control over financial repor\u0000ng is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial repor\u0000ng and\nthe prepara\u0000on of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accoun\u0000ng principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial repor\u0000ng includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transac\u0000ons and disposi\u0000ons of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transac\u0000ons are recorded\n40\nas necessary to permit prepara\u0000on of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accoun\u0000ng principles, and that receipts and expenditures of\nthe company are being made only in accordance with authoriza\u0000ons of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding preven\u0000on or \u0000mely detec\u0000on of unauthorized acquisi\u0000on, use, or disposi\u0000on of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limita\u0000ons, internal control over financial repor\u0000ng may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projec\u0000ons of any evalua\u0000on of\neffec\u0000veness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in condi\u0000ons, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCri\u0000cal Audit Ma\u0000er\nThe cri\u0000cal audit ma\u0000er communicated below is a ma\u0000er arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required\nto be communicated to the audit commi\u0000ee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjec\u0000ve, or complex judgments. The communica\u0000on of cri\u0000cal audit ma\u0000ers does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communica\u0000ng the cri\u0000cal audit ma\u0000er below, providing a separate opinion on the cri\u0000cal audit ma\u0000er or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIntangible Assets, net – Trade name — Refer to Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements\nCri\u0000cal Audit Ma\u0000er Descrip\u0000on\nThe Company has one indefinite-lived intangible asset consis\u0000ng of the Woodward L’Orange trade name (“trade name”). As of September 30, 2024, the\ncarrying value of the trade name is $64.8 million. The trade name is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more o\u0000en if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that indicate the fair value of the trade name may be below its carrying amount. The Company completed its annual impairment test of\nthe trade name as of July 31, 2024. The results of the impairment test indicated the es\u0000mated fair value of the trade name was in excess of its carrying value\nand, accordingly, no impairment existed.\nThe fair value of the trade name was determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach. This\nmethod incorporates various es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, royalty rates and the present value of the\nforecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate. The Company projects revenue growth rates and cash flows based on Woodward\nL’Orange’s current opera\u0000onal results, expected performance and opera\u0000onal strategies over a five-year period. The terminal growth rate of the expected cash\nflow is applied a\u0000er five years. These projec\u0000ons are adjusted to reflect current economic condi\u0000ons and demand for certain products and require\nconsiderable management judgment. Changes in these es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons can have a significant impact on the fair value.\nWe iden\u0000fied the fair value of the trade name as a cri\u0000cal audit ma\u0000er because of the significant judgments and assump\u0000ons management makes related to\nthe projec\u0000on of revenue growth rates and the selec\u0000on of the discount rate, terminal growth rate, and royalty rate. This required a high degree of auditor\njudgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the\nreasonableness of management’s projec\u0000on of revenue growth rates and selec\u0000on of the discount rate, terminal growth rate and royalty rate.\nHow the Cri\u0000cal Audit Ma\u0000er Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the projec\u0000on of revenue growth rates and selec\u0000on of the discount rate, terminal growth rate, and royalty rate used in\ndetermining the fair value of the trade name included the following, among others:\n• We tested the effec\u0000veness of controls over the fair value of the trade name, including those over the projec\u0000on of revenue growth rates and\nthe selec\u0000on of the discount rate, terminal growth rate, and royalty rate.\n41\n• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate, terminal growth rate, and royalty rate by:\no Tes\u0000ng the source informa\u0000on underlying the determina\u0000on of the discount rate, terminal growth rate, and royalty rate and recalcula\u0000ng\nthe mathema\u0000cal accuracy of management’s calcula\u0000on of the discount rate\no Developing a range of independent es\u0000mates of the discount rate and terminal growth rate based on market inputs and comparing those\nto the discount and terminal growth rates selected by management\no Comparing the royalty rate from comparable licensing agreements to the rate selected by management\n• Searching for any events which could adversely impact the fair value of the brand.\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s projected revenue growth rates by:\no Comparing management’s projec\u0000ons to:\n▪ Historical revenue results for Woodward L’Orange\n▪ Internal communica\u0000ons to management and the board of directors\n▪ Analyst and industry reports\n▪ Peer company forecasts\no Considering the impact of changes in management’s projec\u0000ons from the July 31, 2024 annual assessment date to September 30, 2024\nby comparing actual results for the period to management projec\u0000ons within the original valua\u0000on model.\n• We evaluated whether a triggering event existed subsequent to management’s impairment tes\u0000ng date through the balance sheet date.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nDenver, Colorado\nNovember 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\n42\nWOODWARD, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nNote 1. Opera\u0000ons and summary of significant accoun\u0000ng policies\nBasis of presenta\u0000on\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accoun\u0000ng principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.\nGAAP”) and include the accounts of Woodward, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collec\u0000vely “Woodward” or “the Company”).\nNature of opera\u0000ons\nWoodward is an independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of energy control and op\u0000miza\u0000on solu\u0000ons. Woodward designs, produces,\nand services reliable, efficient, low-emission, and high-performance energy control products for diverse applica\u0000ons in challenging environments. Woodward\nhas significant produc\u0000on and assembly facili\u0000es primarily in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and promotes its products and services through its\nworldwide loca\u0000ons.\nWoodward’s strategic focus is providing energy control and op\u0000miza\u0000on solu\u0000ons for the aerospace and industrial markets. The precise and efficient\ncontrol of energy, including mo\u0000on, fluid, combus\u0000on, and electrical energy, is a growing requirement in the markets Woodward serves. Woodward’s\ncustomers look to it to op\u0000mize the efficiency, emissions, and opera\u0000on of power equipment in both commercial and defense opera\u0000ons. Woodward’s core\ntechnologies leverage well across its markets and customer applica\u0000ons, enabling it to develop and integrate cost-effec\u0000ve and state-of-the-art fuel,\ncombus\u0000on, fluid, actua\u0000on, and electronic systems. Woodward focuses its solu\u0000ons and services primarily on serving original equipment manufacturers\n(“OEMs”) and equipment packagers, partnering with them to bring superior component and system solu\u0000ons to their demanding applica\u0000ons. Woodward also\nprovides a\u0000ermarket repair, maintenance, replacement, and other service support for its installed products.\nWoodward’s components and integrated systems op\u0000mize performance of commercial aircra\u0000, defense aircra\u0000, military ground vehicles and other\nequipment, gas and steam turbines, industrial diesel, gas, biodiesel and dual-fuel reciproca\u0000ng engines, and electrical power systems. Woodward’s innova\u0000ve\nmo\u0000on, fluid, combus\u0000on, and electrical energy control systems help its customers offer more cost-effec\u0000ve, cleaner, and more reliable equipment.\nSummary of significant accoun\u0000ng policies\nPrinciples of consolida\u0000on: These Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of Woodward\nand its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. Transac\u0000ons within and between these companies are eliminated.\nUse of es\u0000mates: The prepara\u0000on of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make use of es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons that affect\nthe reported amount of assets and liabili\u0000es, at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses recognized during the repor\u0000ng\nperiod, and certain financial statement disclosures. Significant es\u0000mates include allowances for uncollec\u0000ble amounts, net realizable value of inventories,\ncustomer rebates earned, useful lives of property and iden\u0000fiable intangible assets, the evalua\u0000on of impairments of property, iden\u0000fiable intangible assets\nand goodwill, the provision for income tax and related valua\u0000on reserves, the valua\u0000on of assets and liabili\u0000es acquired in business combina\u0000ons, assump\u0000ons\nused in the determina\u0000on of the funded status and annual expense of pension and postre\u0000rement employee benefit plans, the valua\u0000on of stock\ncompensa\u0000on instruments granted to employees, and con\u0000ngencies. Actual results could differ from those es\u0000mates.\nForeign currency exchange rates: The assets and liabili\u0000es of substan\u0000ally all subsidiaries outside the United States are translated at fiscal year-end\nrates of exchange, and earnings and cash flow statements are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange. The exchange rate in effect at the \u0000me of the\ncash flow is used for significant or infrequent cash flows, such as payments for a business acquisi\u0000on, for which the use of weighted-average rates of exchange\nwould result in a substan\u0000ally different cash flow. Transla\u0000on adjustments are accumulated with other comprehensive (losses) earnings as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity and are presented net of tax effects in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. The effects of changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates on loans between consolidated subsidiaries that are considered permanent in nature are also accumulated with other\ncomprehensive earnings, net of tax.\n48\nThe Company is exposed to market risks related to fluctua\u0000ons in foreign currency exchange rates because some sales transac\u0000ons, and certain assets\nand liabili\u0000es of its domes\u0000c and foreign subsidiaries, are denominated in foreign currencies. Selling, general, and administra\u0000ve expenses include a net\nforeign currency loss of $8,369 in fiscal year 2024, a net foreign currency loss of $1,020 in fiscal year 2023, and a net foreign currency gain of $1,450 in fiscal\nyear 2022.\nRevenue recogni\u0000on: Revenue is recognized on contracts with customers for arrangements in which quan\u0000\u0000es and pricing are fixed and/or\ndeterminable and are generally based on customer purchase orders, o\u0000en within the framework of a long-term supply arrangement with the customer.\nWoodward has determined that it is the principal in its sales transac\u0000ons, as Woodward is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promised performance\nobliga\u0000ons, has discre\u0000on to establish the selling price, and generally assumes the inventory risk. Woodward recognizes revenue for performance obliga\u0000ons\nwithin a customer contract when control of the associated product or service is transferred to the customer. Some of Woodward’s contracts with customers\ncontain a single performance obliga\u0000on, while other contracts contain mul\u0000ple performance obliga\u0000ons. Each product within a contract generally represents a\nseparate performance obliga\u0000on as Woodward does not provide significant installa\u0000on and integra\u0000on services, the products do not customize each other,\nand the products can func\u0000on independently of each other.\nA contract's transac\u0000on price is allocated to each performance obliga\u0000on and recognized as revenue when, or as, the customer obtains control of the\nassociated product or service. When there are mul\u0000ple performance obliga\u0000ons within a contract, Woodward generally uses the observable standalone sales\nprice for each dis\u0000nct product or service within the contract to allocate the transac\u0000on price to the dis\u0000nct products or services. In instances when a\nstandalone sales price for each product or service is not observable within the contract, Woodward allocates the transac\u0000on price to each performance\nobliga\u0000on using an es\u0000mate of the standalone selling price for each product or service, which is generally based on incurred costs plus a reasonable margin,\nfor each dis\u0000nct product or service in the contract.\nWhen determining the transac\u0000on price of each contract, Woodward considers contractual considera\u0000on payable by the customer and variable\nconsidera\u0000on that may affect the total transac\u0000on price. Variable considera\u0000on, consis\u0000ng of early payment discounts, rebates, and other sources of price\nvariability, are included in the es\u0000mated transac\u0000on price based on both customer-specific informa\u0000on as well as historical experience.\nCustomers some\u0000mes trade in used products in exchange for new or refurbished products. In addi\u0000on, Woodward’s customers some\u0000mes provide\ninventory to Woodward which will be integrated into final products sold to those customers. Woodward obtains control of these exchanged products and\ncustomer provided inventory, and therefore, both are forms of noncash considera\u0000on. Noncash considera\u0000on paid by customers on overall sales transac\u0000ons\nis addi\u0000ve to the transac\u0000on price. Woodward’s net sales and cost of goods sold include the value of such noncash considera\u0000on for the same amount, with no\nresul\u0000ng impact to earnings before income taxes. Upon receipt of such inventory, Woodward recognizes an inventory asset and a contract liability.\nPoint in \u0000me and over \u0000me revenue recogni\u0000on: Control of the products generally transfers to the customer at a point in \u0000me, if the customer does not\ncontrol the products as they are produced. Performance obliga\u0000ons are sa\u0000sfied and revenue is recognized over \u0000me if: (i) the customer receives the benefits\nas Woodward performs work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being enhanced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alterna\u0000ve\nuse to Woodward; and (ii) Woodward has an enforceable right to payment with a profit. For products being produced for the customer that have no\nalterna\u0000ve use to Woodward and Woodward has an enforceable right to payment with a profit, and where the products are substan\u0000ally the same and have\nthe same pa\u0000ern of transfer to the customer, revenue is recognized as a series of dis\u0000nct products. As Woodward sa\u0000sfies MRO performance obliga\u0000ons,\nrevenue is recognized over \u0000me, as the customer, rather than Woodward, controls the asset being enhanced. When services are provided, revenue from those\nservices is recognized over \u0000me because control is transferred con\u0000nuously to customers as Woodward performs the work.\nFor services that are not short-term in nature, MRO, and sales of products that have no alterna\u0000ve use to Woodward and an enforceable right to\npayment with a profit, Woodward uses an actual cost input measure to determine the extent of progress towards comple\u0000on of the performance obliga\u0000on.\nFor these revenue streams, revenue is recognized over \u0000me as work is performed based on the rela\u0000onship between actual costs incurred to-date for each\ncontract and the total es\u0000mated costs for such contract at comple\u0000on of the performance obliga\u0000on (the cost-to-cost method). Woodward has concluded that\nthis measure of progress best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer because incurred costs are integral to Woodward’s comple\u0000on of the performance\nobliga\u0000on under the specific customer contract and correlate directly to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, and\noverhead. Contract cost es\u0000mates are based on various assump\u0000ons to project the outcome of future events. These assump\u0000ons include labor\n49\nproduc\u0000vity, and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the\navailability and \u0000ming of funding from the customer. Revenues, including es\u0000mated fees or profits, are recorded propor\u0000onally as costs are incurred.\nIf at any \u0000me the es\u0000mate of contract profitability indicates an an\u0000cipated loss on the contract, Woodward recognizes provisions for es\u0000mated losses on\nuncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined. In situa\u0000ons where the creditworthiness of a customer becomes in doubt,\nWoodward ceases to recognize the over-\u0000me revenue on the associated customer contract.\nOccasionally, Woodward sells maintenance or service arrangements, extended warran\u0000es, or other stand ready services. Woodward recognizes revenue\nfrom such arrangements as a series of performance obliga\u0000ons over the \u0000me period in which the services are available to the customer.\nMaterial rights and costs to fulfill a contract: Customers some\u0000mes pay considera\u0000on to Woodward for product engineering and development ac\u0000vi\u0000es\nthat do not result in the immediate transfer of dis\u0000nct products or services to the customer. There is an implicit assump\u0000on that without the customer making\nsuch advance payments to Woodward, Woodward’s future sales of products or services to the customer would be at a higher selling price; therefore, such\npayments create a “material right” to the customer that effec\u0000vely gives the customer an op\u0000on to acquire future products or services, at a discount, that are\ndependent upon the product engineering and development. Material rights are recorded as contract liabili\u0000es and will be recognized when control of the\nrelated products or services are transferred to the customer.\nWoodward capitalizes costs of product engineering and development iden\u0000fied as material rights up to the amount of customer funding as costs to\nfulfill a contract are incurred because the costs incurred up to the amount of the customer funding commitment are recoverable. Due to the uncertainty of the\nproduct success and/or demand, fulfillment costs in excess of the customer funding are expensed as incurred. Woodward recognizes the deferred material\nrights as revenue based on a percentage of actual sales to total es\u0000mated life\u0000me sales of the related developed products as the customers exercise their\nop\u0000on to acquire addi\u0000onal products or services at a discount. Woodward amor\u0000zes the capitalized costs to fulfill a contract as cost of goods sold\npropor\u0000onally to the recogni\u0000on of the associated deferred material rights. Es\u0000mated total life\u0000me sales are reviewed at least annually and more frequently\nwhen circumstances warrant a modifica\u0000on to the previous es\u0000mate.\nWoodward does not capitalize incremental costs of obtaining a contract, as Woodward does not pay sales commissions or incur other incremental costs\nrelated to contracts with Woodward’s customers for arrangements in which quan\u0000\u0000es and pricing are fixed and/or determinable.\nContract liabili\u0000es: Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized represent contract liabili\u0000es and are recorded as deferred revenues\nwhen customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of Woodward sa\u0000sfying performance obliga\u0000ons under contractual arrangements, including\nthose with performance obliga\u0000ons sa\u0000sfied over \u0000me. Woodward generally receives advance payments from customers related to maintenance or service\narrangements, extended warran\u0000es, or other stand ready services, which it recognizes over the performance period. Contract liabili\u0000es are sa\u0000sfied when\nrevenue is recognized and the performance obliga\u0000on is sa\u0000sfied. Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized are included in deferred\nrevenue, which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the \u0000ming of when Woodward expects to recognize revenue.\nCustomer payments: Woodward occasionally agrees to make payments to certain customers in order to par\u0000cipate in an\u0000cipated sales ac\u0000vity.\nPayments made to customers are accounted for as a reduc\u0000on of revenue unless they are made in exchange for iden\u0000fiable goods or services with fair values\nthat can be reasonably es\u0000mated. Reduc\u0000ons in revenue associated with these customer payments are recognized immediately to the extent that the\npayments cannot be a\u0000ributed to an\u0000cipated future sales, and are recognized in future periods to the extent that the payments relate to an\u0000cipated future\nsales. Such determina\u0000ons are based on the facts and circumstances underlying each payment.\nPurchase accoun\u0000ng: Business combina\u0000ons are accounted for using the purchase method of accoun\u0000ng. Under this method, assets and liabili\u0000es,\nincluding intangible assets, are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisi\u0000on date. Acquisi\u0000on costs in excess of amounts assigned to assets acquired and\nliabili\u0000es assumed are recorded as goodwill. Transac\u0000on-related costs associated with business combina\u0000ons are expensed as incurred.\nStock-based compensa\u0000on: Compensa\u0000on cost rela\u0000ng to stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors is recognized in the financial\nstatements using a fair value method. Non-qualified stock op\u0000on awards, restricted\n50\nstock units, and performance restricted stock units are issued under Woodward’s stock-based compensa\u0000on plans. The cost of such awards, measured at the\ngrant date, is based on the es\u0000mated fair value of the award.\nForfeitures are es\u0000mated at the \u0000me of each grant in order to es\u0000mate the por\u0000on of the award that will ul\u0000mately vest. The es\u0000mate is based on\nWoodward’s historical rates of forfeitures and is updated periodically. The por\u0000on of the award that is ul\u0000mately expected to vest is recognized as expense\nover the requisite service periods, which is generally the ves\u0000ng period of the awards.\nResearch and development costs: Company funded expenditures related to new product development and significant product enhancement and/or\nupgrade ac\u0000vi\u0000es are expensed as incurred and are separately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nIncome taxes: Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial repor\u0000ng basis and the tax basis of Woodward’s\nassets, liabili\u0000es, and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (losses) earnings. Woodward provides for taxes that\nmay be payable if undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries were to be remi\u0000ed to the United States, except for those earnings that it considers to be\nindefinitely invested.\nCash equivalents: Highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts receivable: Almost all of Woodward’s sales are made on credit and result in accounts receivable, which are recorded at the amount invoiced\nand are generally not collateralized. In the normal course of business, not all accounts receivable are collected and, therefore, an allowance for uncollec\u0000ble\namounts is provided equal to the amount that Woodward believes ul\u0000mately will not be collected, either from credit risk or other adjustments to the original\nselling price or an\u0000cipated cash discounts. In establishing the amount of the allowance related to the credit risk of accounts receivable, customer-specific\ninforma\u0000on is considered related to delinquent accounts, past loss experience, bankruptcy filings, deteriora\u0000on in the customer’s opera\u0000ng results or financial\nposi\u0000on, current and forecasted economic condi\u0000ons, and other relevant factors. Bad debt losses are deducted from the allowance, and the related accounts\nreceivable balances are wri\u0000en off when the receivables are deemed uncollec\u0000ble. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously wri\u0000en off are recognized\nwhen received. The allowance associated with an\u0000cipated other adjustments to the selling price or cash discounts is also established and is included in the\nallowance for uncollec\u0000ble amounts. In establishing this amount, both customer-specific informa\u0000on as well as historical experience is considered.\nIn coordina\u0000on with its customers and when terms are considered favorable to Woodward, Woodward from \u0000me-to-\u0000me transfers ownership to collect\namounts due to Woodward for outstanding accounts receivable to third par\u0000es in exchange for cash. When the transfer of accounts receivable meets the\ncriteria of Financial Accoun\u0000ng Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC Topic 860-10, “Transfers and Servicing,” and are without recourse, it is recognized as a sale and\nthe accounts receivable is derecognized, resul\u0000ng in an increase of approximately $1,398 in cash provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es during fiscal year 2024,\ncompared to an increase in cash provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es of approximately $26,273 during fiscal year 2023.\nUnbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the \u0000ming of billing differs from the \u0000ming of revenue recognized, such as when contract provisions\nrequire revenue to be recognized over \u0000me rather than at a point in \u0000me. Unbilled receivables primarily relate to performance obliga\u0000ons sa\u0000sfied over \u0000me\nwhen the cost-to-cost method is u\u0000lized and the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer as there is not yet a right to payment in\naccordance with contractual terms. Unbilled receivables are recorded as a contract asset when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to\nbilling and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract.\nFor composi\u0000on of accounts receivable, see Note 3, Revenue.\nInventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using methods that approximate a first-in,\nfirst-out basis.\n51\nShort-term investments: From \u0000me to \u0000me, certain of Woodward’s foreign subsidiaries will invest excess cash in short-term \u0000me deposits with a fixed\nmaturity date of longer than three months but less than one year from the date of the deposit. Woodward believes that the investments are with creditworthy\nfinancial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons. Amounts with maturi\u0000es of less than 365 days are classified as “Other current assets.”\nProperty, plant, and equipment: Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over the es\u0000mated useful lives of the assets.\nAssets are generally depreciated using the straight-line method. Assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying\nvalue may not be recoverable.\nEs\u0000mated lives over which fixed assets are generally depreciated at September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nLand improvements 10 – 20 years\nBuildings and improvements 10 – 40 years\nLeasehold improvements 1 – 10 years\nMachinery and produc\u0000on equipment 3 – 25 years\nComputer equipment and so\u0000ware 3 – 10 years\nOffice furniture and equipment 3 – 15 years\nOther 3 – 5 years\nIncluded in computer equipment and so\u0000ware are Woodward’s enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems, which have an es\u0000mated useful life of 15\nyears. All other computer equipment and so\u0000ware is generally depreciated over three years to five years.\nLeases: Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabili\u0000es are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the es\u0000mated present value of the\nremaining fixed lease payments over the lease term. In determining the es\u0000mated present value of lease payments, Woodward discounts the fixed lease\npayments using the rate implicit in the agreement or, if the implicit rate is not known, using the incremental borrowing rate. Woodward’s incremental\nborrowing rate is based on the informa\u0000on available at the lease commencement date, with considera\u0000on given to Woodward’s recent debt issuances as well\nas publicly available data for instruments with similar characteris\u0000cs.\nFor opera\u0000ng leases, lease expense is recognized over the expected lease term and classified as a cost of goods sold or selling, general, and\nadministra\u0000ve expense based on the nature of the underlying leased asset. For finance leases, the ROU asset is recognized over the shorter of the useful life of\nthe asset, consistent with Woodward’s normal deprecia\u0000on policy, or the lease term, and is classified as a cost of goods sold, selling, general, and\nadministra\u0000ve expense, or research and development expense, based on the nature and use of the underlying leased asset.\nCertain of Woodward’s opera\u0000ng lease agreements include variable payments that are passed through by the landlord, such as insurance, taxes, and\ncommon area maintenance, payments based on the usage of the asset, and rental payments adjusted periodically for infla\u0000on. Pass-through charges,\npayments due to changes in usage of the asset, and payments due to changes in indexa\u0000on are included within variable rent expense and are recognized in the\nperiod in which the variable obliga\u0000on for the payments was incurred.\nGoodwill: Woodward tests goodwill for impairment at the repor\u0000ng unit level on an annual basis and more o\u0000en if an event occurs or circumstances\nchange that indicates the fair value of a repor\u0000ng unit may be below its carrying amount. Based on the relevant U.S. GAAP authorita\u0000ve guidance, Woodward\naggregates components of a single opera\u0000ng segment into a repor\u0000ng unit, if appropriate. The impairment test consists of comparing the implied fair value of\neach repor\u0000ng unit with its carrying amount that includes goodwill. If the carrying amount of the repor\u0000ng unit exceeds its implied fair value, Woodward\ncompares the implied fair value of goodwill with the recorded carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of\ngoodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its implied fair value.\nBased on the results of Woodward’s annual goodwill impairment tes\u0000ng, no impairment charges were recorded in the year ended September 30, 2024,\n2023, or 2022 or since the goodwill was originally recorded.\n52\nOther intangibles: Other intangibles are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal\nrights, or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired en\u0000ty and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either\nindividually or in combina\u0000on with a related contract, asset, or liability. Woodward amor\u0000zes the cost of other intangibles over their useful lives unless such\nlives are deemed indefinite. The cost of finite-lived other intangibles are amor\u0000zed over their respec\u0000ve useful life using pa\u0000erns that reflect the periods over\nwhich the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized. Amor\u0000za\u0000on expense is allocated to cost of goods sold and selling, general, and\nadministra\u0000ve expenses based on the nature of the intangible asset. Finite-lived other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event\noccurs or circumstances change indica\u0000ng that the related carrying amount of the other intangible asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are\nrecognized if the carrying amount of an intangible is both not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\nWoodward has recorded no impairment charges related to its other intangibles in the year ended September 30, 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nEs\u0000mated lives over which intangible assets are amor\u0000zed at September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nCustomer rela\u0000onships and contracts 11 – 30 years\nIntellectual property 17 years\nProcess technology 10 – 30 years\nOther 1 year\nWoodward has one indefinitely lived intangible asset consis\u0000ng of the Woodward L’Orange trade name. The Woodward L’Orange trade name intangible\nasset is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more o\u0000en if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the Woodward\nL’Orange intangible asset may be below its carrying amount. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the Woodward L’Orange trade name\nintangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows, with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the Woodward L’Orange intangible asset exceeds\nits fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its fair value. Woodward has not recorded any impairment charges\nagainst the L'Orange trade name intangible asset since it was acquired.\nImpairment of long-lived assets: Woodward reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in opera\u0000ons whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment\nassessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business\nclimate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others.\nIf such facts indicate a poten\u0000al impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying amount of\nthe asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposi\u0000on of the assets over the\nremaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying amount of the asset group is not\nrecoverable, the Company will es\u0000mate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valua\u0000on methodologies, which would typically include an es\u0000mate\nof discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its es\u0000mated fair value.\nInvestment in marketable equity securi\u0000es: Woodward holds marketable equity securi\u0000es related to its deferred compensa\u0000on program. Based on\nWoodward’s inten\u0000ons regarding these instruments, marketable equity securi\u0000es are classified as trading securi\u0000es. The trading securi\u0000es are reported at fair\nvalue, with realized gains and losses recognized in “Other (income) expense, net.” The trading securi\u0000es are included in “Other assets.” The associated\nobliga\u0000on to provide benefits under the deferred compensa\u0000on program is included in “Other liabili\u0000es.”\nInvestments in unconsolidated subsidiaries: Investments in, and opera\u0000ng results of, en\u0000\u0000es in which Woodward does not have a controlling financial\ninterest or the ability to exercise significant influence over the opera\u0000ons are included in the financial statements using the cost method of accoun\u0000ng.\nInvestments and opera\u0000ng results of en\u0000\u0000es in which Woodward does not have a controlling interest but does have the ability to exercise significant influence\nover opera\u0000ons are included in the financial statements using the equity method of accoun\u0000ng.\nDeferred compensa\u0000on: The Company maintains a deferred compensa\u0000on plan, or “rabbi trust,” as part of its overall compensa\u0000on package for certain\nemployees.\nDeferred compensa\u0000on obliga\u0000ons will be se\u0000led either by delivery of a fixed number of shares of Woodward’s common stock (in accordance with\ncertain eligible members’ irrevocable elec\u0000ons) or in cash. Woodward has contributed shares of its common stock into a trust established for the future\nse\u0000lement of deferred compensa\u0000on obliga\u0000ons that are payable in shares of Woodward’s common stock. Common stock held by the trust is reflected in the\nConsolidated Balance\n53\nSheets as “Treasury stock held for deferred compensa\u0000on” and the related deferred compensa\u0000on obliga\u0000on is reflected as a separate component of equity in\namounts equal to the fair value of the common stock at the dates of contribu\u0000on. These accounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in the fair value of\nthe common stock. Deferred compensa\u0000on obliga\u0000ons that will be se\u0000led in cash are accounted for on an accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the\nunderlying contract and are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Other liabili\u0000es.”\nFinancial instruments: The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, investments in the deferred\ncompensa\u0000on program, notes receivable from municipali\u0000es, investments in term deposits, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and debt. Because of their\nshort-term maturity, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term debt approximate fair value. Financial assets and liabili\u0000es recorded at\nfair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy established by U.S. GAAP, which priori\u0000zes the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value into the following levels:\nLevel 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices in ac\u0000ve markets for iden\u0000cal assets or liabili\u0000es at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabili\u0000es in ac\u0000ve markets; quoted prices for iden\u0000cal or similar\nassets and liabili\u0000es in markets that are not ac\u0000ve; or other inputs that are observable and can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Inputs reflect management’s best es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons of what market par\u0000cipants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the\nmeasurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valua\u0000on of the instruments.\nFurther informa\u0000on on the fair value of financial instruments can be found at Note 7, Financial instruments and fair value measurements.\nDeriva\u0000ves: The Company is exposed to various global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,\nchanges in certain commodity prices, and fluctua\u0000ons in various producer indices. From \u0000me to \u0000me, Woodward enters into deriva\u0000ve instruments for risk\nmanagement purposes only, including deriva\u0000ves designated as accoun\u0000ng hedges and/or those u\u0000lized as economic hedges. Woodward uses interest rate\nrelated deriva\u0000ve instruments to manage its exposure to fluctua\u0000ons of interest rates. Woodward does not enter into or issue deriva\u0000ves for trading or\nspecula\u0000ve purposes.\nBy using deriva\u0000ve and/or hedging instruments to manage its risk exposure, Woodward is subject, from \u0000me to \u0000me, to credit risk and market risk on\nthose deriva\u0000ve instruments. Credit risk arises from the poten\u0000al failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the deriva\u0000ve and/or hedging\ninstrument. When the fair value of a deriva\u0000ve contract is posi\u0000ve, the counterparty owes Woodward, which creates credit risk for Woodward. Woodward\nmi\u0000gates this credit risk by entering into transac\u0000ons only with counterpar\u0000es that are believed to be creditworthy. Market risk arises from the poten\u0000al\nadverse effects on the value of deriva\u0000ve and/or hedging instruments that result from a change in interest rates, commodity prices, or foreign currency\nexchange rates. Woodward minimizes this market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be\nundertaken.\nFrom \u0000me to \u0000me, in order to hedge against foreign currency exposure, Woodward designates certain non-deriva\u0000ve financial instrument loans as net\ninvestment hedges. Foreign exchange gains or losses on these loans are recognized in foreign currency transla\u0000on adjustments within total comprehensive\n(losses) earnings. Also, to hedge against the foreign currency exposure a\u0000ributable to non-func\u0000onal currency denominated intercompany loans, Woodward\nhas entered into deriva\u0000ve instruments in fair value hedging rela\u0000onships and cash flow hedging rela\u0000onships.\nFurther informa\u0000on on net investment hedges and deriva\u0000ve instruments in fair value and cash flow hedging rela\u0000onships, including the Company’s\npolicy in accoun\u0000ng for these deriva\u0000ves, can be found at Note 8, Deriva\u0000ve instruments and hedging ac\u0000vi\u0000es.\nPostre\u0000rement benefits: The Company provides various benefits to certain current and former employees through defined benefit pension and\npostre\u0000rement plans. For financial repor\u0000ng purposes, net periodic benefits expense and related obliga\u0000ons are calculated using a number of significant\nactuarial assump\u0000ons. Changes in net periodic expense and funding status may occur in the future due to changes in these assump\u0000ons. The funded status of\ndefined pension and postre\u0000rement plans recognized in the statement of financial posi\u0000on is measured as the difference between the fair market value of the\nplan assets and the benefit obliga\u0000on. For a defined benefit pension plan, the benefit obliga\u0000on is the projected benefit obliga\u0000on; for any other defined\nbenefit postre\u0000rement plan, such as a re\u0000ree health care plan, the\n54\nbenefit obliga\u0000on is the accumulated benefit obliga\u0000on. Any over-funded status is recognized as an asset and any underfunded status is recognized as a\nliability.\nProjected benefit obliga\u0000on is the actuarial present value as of the measurement date of all benefits a\u0000ributed by the plan benefit formula to employee\nservice rendered before the measurement date using assump\u0000ons as to future compensa\u0000on levels if the plan benefit formula is based on those future\ncompensa\u0000on levels. The accumulated benefit obliga\u0000on is the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or unvested) a\u0000ributed by the plan benefit\nformula to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensa\u0000on, if applicable, prior to that date. The\naccumulated benefit obliga\u0000on differs from the projected benefit obliga\u0000on in that it includes no assump\u0000on about future compensa\u0000on levels.\nNote 2. New accoun\u0000ng standards\nFrom \u0000me to \u0000me, the Financial Accoun\u0000ng Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standards se\u0000ng bodies issue new accoun\u0000ng pronouncements.\nUpdates to the FASB Accoun\u0000ng Standards Codifica\u0000on (“ASC”) are communicated through issuance of an Accoun\u0000ng Standards Update (“ASU”).\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \"Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\" The purpose of ASU 2023-07 is to provide\nenhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are effec\u0000ve for fiscal years beginning a\u0000er December 15, 2023\n(fiscal year 2025 for Woodward), and interim periods within fiscal years beginning a\u0000er December 15, 2024 (fiscal year 2026 for Woodward), with early\nadop\u0000on permi\u0000ed, and are to be applied on a retrospec\u0000ve basis to all periods presented. Woodward is currently assessing the impact on its segment\nrepor\u0000ng disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\" The purpose of ASU 2023-09 is to provide enhanced\ndisclosures surrounding income taxes by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggrega\u0000on of informa\u0000on in the rate reconcilia\u0000on, the disaggrega\u0000on\nof income taxes paid by jurisdic\u0000on, as well as several other changes to the income tax disclosure. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effec\u0000ve for fiscal\nyears beginning a\u0000er December 15, 2024 (fiscal year 2026 for Woodward), with early adop\u0000on permi\u0000ed, and is required to be applied prospec\u0000vely with the\nop\u0000on of retrospec\u0000ve applica\u0000on. Woodward is currently assessing the impact on its income tax disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Disaggrega\u0000on of Income Statement Expenses\" the purpose of ASU 2024-03 is to provide enhanced\ndisclosures about significant expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The amendments in ASU 2024-03 are effec\u0000ve for fiscal years beginning\na\u0000er December 15, 2026 (fiscal year 2028 for Woodward), and interim periods within fiscal years beginning a\u0000er December 15, 2027 (fiscal year 2029 for\nWoodward), with early adop\u0000on permi\u0000ed, and are to be applied either on a prospec\u0000ve basis to financial statements issued for repor\u0000ng periods a\u0000er the\neffec\u0000ve date or on a retrospec\u0000ve basis to all periods presented. Woodward is currently assessing the impact on its Consolidated Statement of Earnings\ndisclosures.\nNote 3. Revenue\nSales of products\nWoodward primarily generates revenue through the manufacture and sale of engineered aerospace and industrial products, including revenue derived\nfrom MRO performance obliga\u0000ons performed on products originally manufactured by Woodward and subsequently returned by OEM or other end-user\ncustomers. The majority of Woodward’s costs incurred to sa\u0000sfy MRO performance obliga\u0000ons are related to replacing and/or refurbishing component parts of\nthe returned products to restore the units back to a condi\u0000on generally comparable to that of the unit upon its ini\u0000al sale to an OEM customer. Therefore,\nWoodward considers almost all of its revenue to be derived from product sales, including those related to MRO.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nManufactured products 83% 84% 84%\nMRO 15% 14% 14%\nServices 2% 2% 2%\n55\nPoint in \u0000me and over \u0000me revenue recogni\u0000on\nThe amount of revenue recognized as point in \u0000me or over \u0000me follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAerospace Industrial Consolidated Aerospace Industrial Consolidated Aerospace Industrial Consolidated\nPoint in \u0000me $ 853,728 $ 780,794 $ 1,634,522 $ 748,278 $ 708,458 $ 1,456,736 $ 593,233 $ 509,737 $ 1,102,970\nOver \u0000me 1,174,890 514,837 1,689,727 1,019,825 438,005 1,457,830 926,089 353,731 1,279,820\nTotal net sales $ 2,028,618 $ 1,295,631 $ 3,324,249 $ 1,768,103 $ 1,146,463 $ 2,914,566 $ 1,519,322 $ 863,468 $ 2,382,790\nMaterial rights and costs to fulfill a contract\nAmounts recognized related to changes in es\u0000mated total life\u0000me sales for material rights and costs to fulfill contracts with customers follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenue $ 17,154 $ 1,460 $ 1,514\nCost of goods sold 15,486 1,736 667\nAmounts recognized related to amor\u0000za\u0000on of costs to fulfill contracts and contract liabili\u0000es, which were not related to changes in es\u0000mate, follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenue $ 7,230 $ 6,741 $ 4,107\nCost of goods sold 3,112 5,559 3,077\nAs of September 30, 2024, “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets included $185,102 of capitalized costs to fulfill contracts with customers,\ncompared to $180,228 as of September 30, 2023.\nAccounts receivable and contract assets\nCustomer receivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers as well as unbilled amounts (contract assets) and are included in\n“Accounts receivable” in Woodward’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts are billed in accordance with contractual terms, which are generally \u0000ed to\nshipment of the products to the customer, or as work progresses in accordance with contractual terms. Billed accounts receivable are typically due within 60\ndays. Woodward’s contracts with customers generally have no financing components.\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBilled receivables\nTrade accounts receivable $ 455,831 $ 434,287\nOther (Chinese financial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons) 1,403 50,940\nTotal billed receivables 457,234 485,227\nCurrent unbilled receivables (contract assets) 320,570 270,479\nTotal accounts receivable 777,804 755,706\nLess: Allowance for uncollec\u0000ble amounts (7,738) (5,847)\nTotal accounts receivable, net $ 770,066 $ 749,859\nAs of September 30, 2024, “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes $11,237 of unbilled receivables not expected to be invoiced and\ncollected within a period of twelve months, compared to $7,332 as of September 30, 2023. Unbilled receivables not expected to be invoiced and collected\nwithin a period of twelve months are primarily a\u0000ributable to the \u0000ming of revenue recognized in excess of billings in the Aerospace segment.\nBilled and unbilled accounts receivable from the U.S. Government were less than 10% of total billed and unbilled accounts receivable at September 30,\n2024 and September 30, 2023.\n56\nThe allowance for uncollec\u0000ble amounts and change in expected credit losses for trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables (contract assets)\nconsisted of the following:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nBalance, beginning $ 5,847 $ 3,922 $ 3,664\nChanges in es\u0000mates 3,219 7,211 447\nWrite-offs (586) (5,305) (46)\nOther1 (742) 19 (143)\nBalance, ending $ 7,738 $ 5,847 $ 3,922\n(1) Includes effects of foreign exchange rate changes during the period.\nContract liabili\u0000es\nContract liabili\u0000es consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCurrent Noncurrent Current Noncurrent\nDeferred revenue from material rights from JV forma\u0000on $ 6,580 $ 232,164 $ 6,147 $ 233,997\nDeferred revenue from advanced invoicing and/or prepayments from customers 23,706 6,437 6,868 2,196\nLiability related to customer supplied inventory 20,563 — 14,543 —\nDeferred revenue from material rights related to engineering and development\nfunding 5,942 186,008 6,190 178,464\nNet contract liabili\u0000es $ 56,791 $ 424,609 $ 33,748 $ 414,657\nThe current por\u0000on of contract liabili\u0000es is included in “Accrued liabili\u0000es” and the noncurrent por\u0000on is included in “Other liabili\u0000es” of Woodward’s\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Woodward recognized revenue of $44,398 in the year ended September 30, 2024 from contract liabili\u0000es balances recorded as\nof September 30, 2023, compared to $25,190 in the year ended September 30, 2023 from contract liabili\u0000es balances recorded as of September 30, 2022.\nThe amount of revenue recognized related to noncash considera\u0000on received from customers follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAerospace $ 61,323 $ 50,329 $ 63,358\nIndustrial 4,974 1,939 2,343\nConsolidated $ 66,297 $ 52,268 $ 65,701\nRemaining performance obliga\u0000ons\nRemaining performance obliga\u0000ons related to the aggregate amount of the total contract transac\u0000on price of firm orders for which the performance\nobliga\u0000on has not yet been recognized in revenue as of September 30, 2024 was $2,932,793, compared to $2,325,533 as of September 30, 2023, the majority\nof which in both periods relate to Woodward’s Aerospace segment. Woodward expects to recognize almost all of these remaining performance obliga\u0000ons\nwithin two years a\u0000er September 30, 2024.\nRemaining performance obliga\u0000ons related to material rights that have not yet been recognized in revenue as of September 30, 2024 was $509,366, of\nwhich $14,788 is expected to be recognized in fiscal year 2025, and the balance is expected to be recognized therea\u0000er. Woodward expects to recognize\nrevenue from performance obliga\u0000ons related to material rights over the life of the underlying programs, which may be as long as forty years.\nDisaggrega\u0000on of revenue\nWoodward designs, produces, and services reliable, efficient, low-emission, and high-performance energy control products for diverse applica\u0000ons in\nmarkets throughout the world. Woodward reports financial results for each of its Aerospace and Industrial reportable segments.

The specific manufacturing contracts that met the criteria\nwere those that u\u0000lized Woodward property, plant, and equipment and which is substan\u0000ally (more than 90%) dedicated to the manufacturing of the\nproduct(s) for a single customer. Woodward has dedicated manufacturing lines with four of its customers represen\u0000ng embedded leases, all of which qualified\nas opera\u0000ng leases with undefined quan\u0000\u0000es of future customer purchase commitments.\nAlthough Woodward expects to allocate some por\u0000on of future net sales to these customers to embedded lessor arrangements, it cannot provide\nexpected future undiscounted lease payments from property, plant, and equipment leased to customers as of September 30, 2024. If, in the future, customers\nreduce purchases of related products from Woodward, the Company believes it will derive addi\u0000onal value from the underlying equipment by repurposing its\nuse to support other customer arrangements.\n60\nWoodward recognizes revenue from the embedded lessor arrangements based on the value of the underlying dedicated property, plant, and\nequipment. There are no fixed payments that the customers under the embedded lessor arrangements are obligated to pay. Therefore, all the customer\npayments under the embedded lessor arrangements are considered variable with the associated leasing revenue recognized when the revenue from\nunderlying product sale related to variable lease payment is recognized. Revenue from contracts with customers that included embedded opera\u0000ng leases,\nwhich is included in “Net sales” at the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, was $5,486 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5,030 for\nthe fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and $5,528 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment leased to others through embedded leasing arrangements, included in “Property, plant, and\nequipment, net” at the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nProperty, plant, and equipment $ 48,495 $ 45,766\nLess accumulated deprecia\u0000on (32,994) (28,128)\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net $ 15,501 $ 17,638\nNote 6. Joint venture\nIn fiscal year 2016, Woodward and GE consummated the forma\u0000on of the strategic JV to develop, manufacture, and support fuel systems for specified\nexis\u0000ng and all future GE Aerospace commercial aircra\u0000 engines that produce thrust in excess of fi\u0000y thousand pounds. Since the split at GE, GE has been\nac\u0000ng though GE Aerospace.\nUnamor\u0000zed deferred revenue from material rights in connec\u0000on with the JV forma\u0000on included:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAccrued liabili\u0000es $ 6,580 $ 6,147\nOther liabili\u0000es 232,164 233,997\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on of the deferred revenue (material right) recognized as an increase to sales was $6,294 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024,\n$5,020 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and $3,633 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nWoodward and GE Aerospace jointly manage the JV and any significant decisions and/or ac\u0000ons of the JV require the mutual consent of both par\u0000es.\nNeither Woodward nor GE Aerospace has a controlling financial interest in the JV, but both Woodward and GE Aerospace do have the ability to significantly\ninfluence the opera\u0000ng and financial decisions of the JV. Therefore, Woodward is accoun\u0000ng for its 50% ownership interest in the JV using the equity method\nof accoun\u0000ng. The JV is a related party to Woodward. In addi\u0000on, GE Aerospace will con\u0000nue to pay con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on to Woodward consis\u0000ng of\nfi\u0000een annual payments of $4,894 each, which began on January 4, 2017, subject to certain claw-back condi\u0000ons. Woodward received its seventh and eighth\nannual payments of $4,894 during the three-months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respec\u0000vely, which were recorded as deferred income and\nincluded in net cash provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Neither Woodward nor GE at the \u0000me contributed any\ntangible assets to the JV.\nOther income related to Woodward’s equity interest in the earnings of the JV was as follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nOther income $ 41,191 $ 36,846 $ 18,193\nCash distribu\u0000ons to Woodward from the JV, recognized in net cash provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,\ninclude:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nCash distribu\u0000ons $ 38,000 $ 29,000 $ 17,000\n61\nNet sales to the JV were as follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nNet sales1 $ 80,708 $ 47,607 $ 28,100\n(1) Net sales include a reduc\u0000on of $63,794 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, $49,624 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023,\nand $28,054 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 related to royal\u0000es owed to the JV by Woodward on sales by Woodward directly to\nthird party a\u0000ermarket customers.\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets include “Accounts receivable” related to amounts the JV owed Woodward, “Accounts payable” related to amounts\nWoodward owed the JV, and “Other assets” related to Woodward’s net investment in the JV, as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAccounts receivable $ 5,205 $ 3,666\nAccounts payable 11,378 6,276\nOther assets 19,219 16,028\nWoodward records in “Other liabili\u0000es” amounts invoiced to the JV for support of the JV’s engineering and development projects as an increase to\ncontract liabili\u0000es and records in “Other assets” related incurred expenditures as costs to fulfill a contract. Contract liabili\u0000es and costs to fulfill a contract was\nas follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nContract liabili\u0000es $ 78,226 $ 84,059\nCosts to fulfill a contract 78,226 84,059\nWoodward recognized revenue of $812 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, from contract liabili\u0000es, recorded as of September 30, 2023,\ncompared to $870 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, from contract liabili\u0000es recorded as of September 30, 2022. Compara\u0000vely, Woodward\nrecognized cost of goods sold of $1,236 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, from contract assets, recorded as of September 30, 2023, compared to\n$870 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, from contract assets recorded as of September 30, 2022.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, Woodward recognized a $9,680 reduc\u0000on in the contract liability and a $9,680 reduc\u0000on in costs to fulfill a\ncontract related to the termina\u0000on of a JV engineering and development project previously recognized as a material right. No reduc\u0000ons in costs to fulfill a\ncontract or contract liabili\u0000es were recorded during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the termina\u0000on of joint venture engineering and\ndevelopment projects.\nNote 7. Financial instruments and fair value measurements\nThe table below presents informa\u0000on about Woodward’s financial assets and liabili\u0000es that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates\nthe fair value hierarchy of the valua\u0000on techniques Woodward u\u0000lized to determine such fair value.\nAt September 30, 2024 At September 30, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFinancial assets:\nInvestments in banks and financial\nins\u0000tu\u0000ons $ 23,128 $ — $ — $ 23,128 $ 28,560 $ — $ — $ 28,560\nEquity securi\u0000es 30,782 — — 30,782 24,913 — — 24,913\nCross-currency interest rate swaps — — — — — 5,389 — 5,389\nTotal financial assets $ 53,910 $ — $ — $ 53,910 $ 53,473 $ 5,389 $ — $ 58,862\nFinancial liabili\u0000es:\nCross-currency interest rate swaps $ — $ 12,004 $ — $ 12,004 $ — $ — $ — $ —\nTotal financial liabili\u0000es $ — $ 12,004 $ — $ 12,004 $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInvestments in banks and financial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons: Woodward’s and its subsidiaries some\u0000mes invest excess cash in various highly liquid financial\ninstruments that Woodward believes are with creditworthy financial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons. Such investments are reported in “Cash and cash equivalents” at fair value,\nwith realized gains from interest income recognized\n62\nin earnings. The carrying value of Woodward’s investments in banks and financial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons are considered equal to the fair value given the highly liquid\nnature of the investments.\nEquity securi\u0000es: Woodward holds marketable equity securi\u0000es, through investments in various mutual funds, related to its deferred compensa\u0000on\nprogram. Based on Woodward’s inten\u0000ons regarding these instruments, marketable equity securi\u0000es are classified as trading securi\u0000es. The trading securi\u0000es\nare reported at fair value, with realized gains and losses recognized in “Other (income) expense, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The trading\nsecuri\u0000es are included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of Woodward’s trading securi\u0000es are based on the quoted market\nprices for the net asset value of the various mutual funds.\nCross-currency interest rate swaps: Woodward holds cross-currency interest rate swaps, which are accounted for at fair value. The swaps in an asset\nposi\u0000on are included in “Other current assets” and “Other assets,” and swaps in a liability posi\u0000on are included in “Accrued liabili\u0000es” and “Other liabili\u0000es” in\nthe Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of Woodward’s cross-currency interest rate swaps are determined using a market approach that is\nbased on observable inputs other than quoted market prices, including contract terms, interest rates, currency rates, and other market factors.\nCash, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings are not remeasured to fair value, as the carrying cost of each\napproximates its respec\u0000ve fair value.\nThe es\u0000mated fair values and carrying costs of other financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets were as follows:\nAt September 30, 2024 At September 30, 2023\nFair Value\nHierarchy Es\u0000mated Carrying Es\u0000mated Carrying\nLevel Fair Value Cost Fair Value Cost\nAssets:\nNotes receivable from municipali\u0000es 2 $ 6,961 $ 6,514 $ 7,794 $ 7,688\nInvestments in short-term \u0000me deposits 2 3,064 3,064 6,095 6,107\nLiabili\u0000es:\nLong-term debt 2 $ 634,071 $ 656,360 $ 661,507 $ 722,671\nIn connec\u0000on with certain economic incen\u0000ves related to Woodward’s development of a second campus in the greater-Rockford, Illinois area for its\nAerospace segment and Woodward’s development of its corporate headquarters in Fort Collins, Colorado, Woodward received long-term notes from\nmunicipali\u0000es within the states of Illinois and Colorado. The fair value of the long-term notes was es\u0000mated based on a model that discounted future principal\nand interest payments received at an interest rate available to the Company at the end of the period for similarly rated municipal notes of similar maturity,\nwhich is a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The interest rates used to es\u0000mate the fair value of the long-term notes were 2.7% at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 3.6% at September 30, 2023.\nFrom \u0000me to \u0000me, certain of Woodward’s foreign subsidiaries will invest excess cash in short-term \u0000me deposits with a fixed maturity date of longer\nthan three months but less than one year from the date of the deposit. Woodward believes that the investments are with creditworthy financial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons.\nThe fair value of the investments in short-term \u0000me deposits was es\u0000mated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments to be\nreceived at an interest rate available to the foreign subsidiary entering into the investment for similar short-term \u0000me deposits of similar maturity. This was\ndetermined to be a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The interest rates used to es\u0000mate the fair value of the short-term \u0000me\ndeposits was 6.8% at September 30, 2024 and at September 30, 2023.\nThe fair value of long-term debt was es\u0000mated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments at interest rates available to the\nCompany at the end of the period for similar debt of the same maturity, which is a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The weighted-\naverage interest rates used to es\u0000mate the fair value of long-term debt were 4.5% at September 30, 2024 and 5.9% at September 30, 2023.\nNote 8. Deriva\u0000ve instruments and hedging ac\u0000vi\u0000es\nDeriva\u0000ve instruments not designated or qualifying as hedging instruments\nIn May 2020, Woodward entered into a floa\u0000ng-rate cross-currency interest rate swap (the “2020 Floa\u0000ng-Rate Cross-Currency Swap”), with a no\u0000onal\nvalue of $45,000, and five fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swap agreements (the “2020 Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps”), with an aggregate no\u0000onal\nvalue of $400,000, which effec\u0000vely reduced the\n63\ninterest rates on the underlying fixed and floa\u0000ng-rate debt, respec\u0000vely, under the 2018 Notes (as defined in Note 15, Credit facili\u0000es, short-term borrowings\nand long-term debt) and Woodward’s then exis\u0000ng revolving credit agreement.\nThe net interest income of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is recorded as a reduc\u0000on to “Interest expense” in Woodward’s Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings. The 2020 Floa\u0000ng-Rate Cross-Currency Swap expired on May 31, 2023 and, as such, is no longer recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. As of September 30, 2024, the total no\u0000onal value of the 2020 Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps was $400,000. See Note 7, Financial instruments and\nfair value measurements, for the related fair value of the deriva\u0000ve instruments as of September 30, 2024.\nDeriva\u0000ves instruments in fair value hedging rela\u0000onships\nIn May 2020, Woodward entered into a US dollar denominated intercompany loan payable with iden\u0000cal terms and no\u0000onal value as the 2020 Floa\u0000ng-\nRate Cross-Currency Swap, together with a reciprocal intercompany floa\u0000ng-rate cross-currency interest rate swap. The agreements were entered into by\nWoodward Barbados Euro Financing SRL (“Euro Barbados”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward. The US dollar denominated intercompany loan and\nreciprocal intercompany floa\u0000ng-rate cross-currency interest rate swap are designated as a fair value hedge under the criteria prescribed in ASC 815. The\nobjec\u0000ve of the deriva\u0000ve instrument is to hedge against the foreign currency exchange risk a\u0000ributable to the spot remeasurement of the US dollar\ndenominated intercompany loan, as Euro Barbados maintains a Euro func\u0000onal currency.\nFor each floa\u0000ng-rate intercompany cross-currency interest rate swap, only the change in the fair value related to the cross-currency basis spread, or\nexcluded component, of the deriva\u0000ve instrument is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"OCI\"). The remaining change in the fair value\nof the deriva\u0000ve instrument is recognized in foreign currency transac\u0000on gain or loss included in “Selling, general, and administra\u0000ve costs” in Woodward’s\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings. The change in the fair value of the deriva\u0000ve instrument in foreign currency transac\u0000on gain or loss offsets the change in\nthe spot remeasurement of the intercompany Euro and US dollar denominated loans. Hedge effec\u0000veness is assessed based on the fair value changes of the\nderiva\u0000ve instrument, a\u0000er excluding any fair value changes related to the cross-currency basis spread. The ini\u0000al cost of the cross-currency basis spread is\nrecorded in earnings each period through the swap accrual process. There are no credit-risk-related con\u0000ngent features associated with the intercompany\nfloa\u0000ng-rate cross-currency interest rate swap.\nDeriva\u0000ve instruments in cash flow hedging rela\u0000onships\nIn May 2020, Woodward entered into five US dollar intercompany loans payable, with iden\u0000cal terms and no\u0000onal values of each tranche of the 2020\nFixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps, together with reciprocal fixed-rate intercompany cross-currency interest rate swaps. The agreements were entered into by\nEuro Barbados and are designated as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in ASC 815. The objec\u0000ve of these deriva\u0000ve instruments is to hedge the\nrisk of variability in cash flows a\u0000ributable to the foreign currency exchange risk of cash flows for future principal and interest payments associated with the US\ndollar denominated intercompany loans over a thirteen-year period, as Euro Barbados maintains a Euro func\u0000onal currency.\nFor each of the fixed-rate intercompany cross-currency interest rate swaps, changes in the fair values of the deriva\u0000ve instruments are recognized in\naccumulated OCI and reclassified to foreign currency transac\u0000on gain or loss included in “Selling, general, and administra\u0000ve costs” in Woodward’s\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings. Reclassifica\u0000ons out of accumulated OCI of the change in fair value occur each repor\u0000ng period based upon changes in\nthe spot rate remeasurement of the Euro and US dollar denominated intercompany loans, including associated interest. Hedge effec\u0000veness is assessed based\non the fair value changes of the deriva\u0000ve instruments and such hedges are deemed to be highly effec\u0000ve in offse\u0000ng exposure to variability in foreign\nexchange rates. There are no credit-risk-related con\u0000ngent features associated with these fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps.\nDeriva\u0000ves instruments in net investment hedging rela\u0000onships\nOn September 23, 2016, Woodward and Woodward Interna\u0000onal Holding B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward organized under the laws of The\nNetherlands (the “BV Subsidiary”), each entered into a note purchase agreement (the “2016 Note Purchase Agreement”) rela\u0000ng to the sale by Woodward\nand the BV Subsidiary of an aggregate principal amount of €160,000 of senior unsecured notes in a series of private placement transac\u0000ons. Woodward issued\n€40,000 aggregate principal amount of Woodward’s Series M Senior Notes due September 23, 2026 (the “Series M Notes”). Woodward designated the Series\nM Notes as a hedge of a foreign currency exposure of Woodward’s net investment in its Euro denominated func\u0000onal currency subsidiaries. Related to the\nSeries M Notes, included in foreign currency transla\u0000on adjustments within total comprehensive (losses) earnings are net foreign exchange losses of $2,381 for\nthe fiscal year\n64\nended September 30, 2024, compared to net foreign exchange losses of $3,090 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and net foreign exchange gains\nof $7,206 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nImpact of deriva\u0000ve instruments designated as qualifying hedging instruments\nThe following table discloses the amount of (income) expense recognized in earnings on deriva\u0000ve instruments designated as qualifying hedging\ninstruments:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDeriva\u0000ves in: Loca\u0000on 2024 2023 2022\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreement designated as fair Selling, general and administra\u0000ve\nvalue hedges expenses $ — $ 939 $ (2,844)\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreements designated as cash Selling, general and administra\u0000ve\nflow hedges expenses 23,093 32,285 (66,036)\n$ 23,093 $ 33,224 $ (68,880)\nThe following table discloses the amount of (gain) loss recognized in accumulated OCI on deriva\u0000ve instruments designated as qualifying hedging\ninstruments:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDeriva\u0000ves in: Loca\u0000on 2024 2023 2022\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreement designated as fair Selling, general and administra\u0000ve\nvalue hedges expenses $ — $ 875 $ (2,854)\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreements designated as cash Selling, general and administra\u0000ve\nflow hedges expenses 18,551 35,712 (86,194)\n$ 18,551 $ 36,587 $ (89,048)\nThe following table discloses the amount of (gain) loss reclassified from accumulated OCI on deriva\u0000ve instruments designated as qualifying hedging\ninstruments:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDeriva\u0000ves in: Loca\u0000on 2024 2023 2022\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreement designated as fair Selling, general and administra\u0000ve\nvalue hedges expenses $ — $ 939 $ (2,844)\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreements designated as cash Selling, general and administra\u0000ve\nflow hedges expenses 23,093 32,285 (66,036)\n$ 23,093 $ 33,224 $ (68,880)\nThe remaining unrecognized gains and losses in Woodward’s Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with deriva\u0000ve instruments that were previously\nentered into by Woodward, which are classified in accumulated OCI were net losses of $5,160 as of September 30, 2024 and $9,701 as of September 30, 2023.\nNote 9.

Acquisi\u0000ons\nOn August 2, 2022, we entered into a series of Purchase Agreements with one of our Asia pacific channel partners, PM Control PLC (the “PM\nAgreements”). Pursuant to the PM Agreements, we agreed to acquire business assets and shares of stock of PM Control PLC and its affiliates (collec\u0000vely, “PM\nControl”), for a total considera\u0000on (net of a working capital adjustment, excluding cash acquired from the acquisi\u0000on, and including the se\u0000lement of pre-\nexis\u0000ng rela\u0000onships) of $21,421 (the “PM Acquisi\u0000on”). The PM Acquisi\u0000on closed on August 31, 2022 (the “PM Closing”) and PM Control PLC became a\nwholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\n65\nASC Topic 805, “Business Combina\u0000ons” (“ASC 805”), provides a framework to account for acquisi\u0000on transac\u0000ons under U.S. GAAP.

Woodward completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2024 during the quarter ended September\n30, 2024. The fair value of each of Woodward’s repor\u0000ng units was determined using a discounted cash flow method. This method represents a Level 3 input\nand incorporates various es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, earnings margins, future tax rates, and the\npresent value, based on an es\u0000mated weighted-average cost of capital (or the discount rate) and terminal growth rate, of forecasted cash flows. Management\nprojects revenue growth rates, earnings margins, and cash flows based on each repor\u0000ng unit’s current opera\u0000onal results, expected performance, and\nopera\u0000onal strategies over a five-year period. These projec\u0000ons are adjusted to reflect current economic condi\u0000ons and demand for certain products and\nrequire considerable management judgment.\nForecasted cash flows used in the July 31, 2024 impairment test were discounted using weighted-average cost of capital assump\u0000ons ranging from\n10.31% to 10.33%. The terminal values of the forecasted cash flows were calculated using the Gordon Growth Model and assumed an annual compound\ngrowth rate a\u0000er five years of 5.07%. These inputs, which are unobservable in the market and are Level 3 inputs, represent management’s best es\u0000mate of\nwhat market par\u0000cipants would use in determining the present value of the Company’s forecasted cash flows. Changes in these es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons\ncan have a significant impact on the fair value of forecasted cash flows. Woodward evaluated the reasonableness of the repor\u0000ng units’ resul\u0000ng fair values\nu\u0000lizing a market mul\u0000ple method. The results of Woodward’s goodwill impairment test performed as of July 31, 2024 did not indicate impairment of any of\nWoodward’s repor\u0000ng units.\n67\nNote 14.

The impairment test consists of comparing\nthe fair value of the Woodward L’Orange trade name intangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under\nthe income approach, with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the Woodward L’Orange trade name intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an\nimpairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its fair value. Woodward has not recognized any impairment charges for this asset.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Woodward completed its annual impairment test of the Woodward L’Orange trade name intangible asset as of July 31, 2024\nfor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of the Woodward L’Orange trade name intangible assets was determined using discounted cash\nflows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach. This method represents a Level 3 input and incorporates various es\u0000mates and\nassump\u0000ons, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, royalty rates, future tax rates, and the present value, based on an es\u0000mated\nweighted-average cost of capital (or the discount rate) and terminal growth rate, of the forecasted cash flow. Management projects revenue growth rates and\ncash flows based on Woodward L’Orange’s current opera\u0000onal results, expected performance, and opera\u0000onal strategies over a five year period. These\nprojec\u0000ons are adjusted to reflect current economic condi\u0000ons and demand for certain products and require considerable management judgment.\n68\nThe forecasted cash flow used in the July 31, 2024 impairment test was discounted using weighted-average cost of capital assump\u0000on of 10.20%. The\nterminal value of the forecasted cash flow was calculated using the Gordon Growth Model and assumed an annual compound growth rate a\u0000er five years of\n5.07%. These inputs, which are unobservable in the market and are Level 3 inputs, represent management’s best es\u0000mate of what market par\u0000cipants would\nuse in determining the present value of the Company’s forecasted cash flows. Changes in these es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons can have a significant impact on the\nfair value of the forecasted cash flow. The results of impairment test performed as of July 31, 2024 indicated the es\u0000mated fair value of the Woodward\nL’Orange trade name intangible asset was in excess of its carrying value, and accordingly, no impairment existed.\nFinite-lived intangible assets\nWoodward recorded amor\u0000za\u0000on expense associated with intangibles of the following:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on expense $ 33,592 $ 37,589 $ 37,609\nFuture amor\u0000za\u0000on expense associated with intangibles is expected to be:\nYear Ending September 30:\n2025 $ 28,360\n2026 28,350\n2027 28,297\n2028 27,704\n2029 26,375\nTherea\u0000er 236,582\n$ 375,668\nNote 15.

Bank dra\u0000s are financial instruments issued by Chinese financial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons as part of financing\narrangements between the financial ins\u0000tu\u0000on and a customer of the financial ins\u0000tu\u0000on. Bank dra\u0000s represent a commitment by the issuing financial\nins\u0000tu\u0000on to pay a certain amount of money at a specified future maturity date to the legal owner of the bankers' acceptance note as of the maturity date.\nWoodward has elected to adopt the prac\u0000cal expedient to not adjust the promised amounts of considera\u0000on at contract incep\u0000on as the financing component\nassociated with issuing bank dra\u0000s has a dura\u0000on of less than one year. There were no borrowings outstanding on Woodward’s foreign lines of credit and\nforeign overdra\u0000 facili\u0000es as of both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nLong-term debt\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSeries H notes – 4.03%, due November 15, 2023; unsecured $ — $ 25,000\nSeries I notes – 4.18%, due November 15, 2025; unsecured 25,000 25,000\nSeries K notes – 4.03%, due November 15, 2023; unsecured — 50,000\nSeries L notes – 4.18%, due November 15, 2025; unsecured 50,000 50,000\nSeries M notes – 1.12% due September 23, 2026; unsecured 44,656 42,280\nSeries N notes – 1.31% due September 23, 2028; unsecured 85,963 81,390\nSeries O notes – 1.57% due September 23, 2031; unsecured 48,005 45,451\nSeries P notes – 4.27% due May 30, 2025; unsecured 85,000 85,000\nSeries Q notes – 4.35% due May 30, 2027; unsecured 85,000 85,000\nSeries R notes – 4.41% due May 30, 2029; unsecured 75,000 75,000\nSeries S notes – 4.46% due May 30, 2030; unsecured 75,000 75,000\nSeries T notes – 4.61% due May 30, 2033; unsecured 80,000 80,000\nFinance leases (Note 5) 2,736 3,550\nUnamor\u0000zed debt issuance costs (890) (1,145)\nTotal long-term debt 655,470 721,526\nLess: Current por\u0000on of long-term debt 85,719 75,817\nLong-term debt, less current por\u0000on $ 569,751 $ 645,709\nThe Notes\nOn October 1, 2013, Woodward entered into a note purchase agreement rela\u0000ng to the sale by Woodward of an aggregate principal amount of\n$250,000 of its senior unsecured notes in a series of private placement transac\u0000ons. Woodward issued the Series H and I Notes (the “First Closing Notes”) on\nOctober 1, 2013. Woodward issued the Series K and L Notes (the “Second Closing Notes” and with the First Closing Notes, collec\u0000vely the “USD Notes”) on\nNovember 15, 2013. On November 15, 2023, Woodward paid the en\u0000re principal balance of $75,000 on the Series H and K Notes using proceeds from\nborrowings under its exis\u0000ng revolving credit facility.\nOn September 23, 2016, Woodward and the BV Subsidiary each entered into note purchase agreements (the “2016 Note Purchase Agreements”)\nrela\u0000ng to the sale by Woodward and the BV Subsidiary of an aggregate principal amount of\n70\n€160,000 of senior unsecured notes in a series of private placement transac\u0000ons. Woodward issued €40,000 Series M Notes. The BV Subsidiary issued (a)\n€77,000 aggregate principal amount of the BV Subsidiary’s Series N Senior Notes (the “Series N Notes”) and (b) €43,000 aggregate principal amount of the BV\nSubsidiary’s Series O Senior Notes (the “Series O Notes” and together with the Series M Notes and the Series N Notes, the “2016 Notes”).\nOn May 31, 2018, Woodward entered into a note purchase agreement (the “2018 Note Purchase Agreement”) rela\u0000ng to the sale by Woodward of an\naggregate principal amount of $400,000 of senior unsecured notes comprised of (a) $85,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series P Senior Notes (the\n“Series P Notes”), (b) $85,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series Q Senior Notes (the “Series Q Notes”), (c) $75,000 aggregate principal amount of its\nSeries R Senior Notes (the “Series R Notes”), (d) $75,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series S Senior Notes (the “Series S Notes”), and (e) $80,000\naggregate principal amount of its Series T Senior Notes (the “Series T Notes”, and together with the Series P Notes, the Series Q Notes, the Series R Notes, and\nthe Series S Notes, the “2018 Notes,” and, together with the USD Notes and 2016 Notes, the “Notes”), in a series of private placement transac\u0000ons.\nIn connec\u0000on with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, the Company entered into cross-currency swap transac\u0000ons in respect of each tranche of the 2018\nNotes, which effec\u0000vely reduced the interest rates on the Series P Notes to 1.82% per annum, the Series Q Notes to 2.15% per annum, the Series R Notes to\n2.42% per annum, the Series S Notes to 2.55% per annum and the Series T Notes to 2.90% per annum. The Company entered into the 2020 Floa\u0000ng-Rate\nCross-Currency Swap and 2020 Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps, which effec\u0000vely resulted in the interest rates on the Series P Notes being 3.44% per annum,\nthe Series Q Notes to 3.44% per annum, the Series R Notes to 3.45% per annum, the Series S Notes to 3.50% per annum and the Series T Notes to 3.62% per\nannum (see Note 8, Deriva\u0000ve instruments and hedging ac\u0000vi\u0000es).\nInterest on the USD Notes are payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year un\u0000l all principal is paid. Interest on the 2016 Notes is\npayable semi-annually on March 23 and September 23 of each year, un\u0000l all principal is paid.\nNone of the Notes were registered under the Securi\u0000es Act of 1933 and they may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registra\u0000on or an\napplicable exemp\u0000on from registra\u0000on requirements. Holders of the Notes do not have any registra\u0000on rights. All of the issued Notes are held by mul\u0000ple\nins\u0000tu\u0000ons.\nWoodward’s payment and performance obliga\u0000ons under the Notes, including without limita\u0000on the obliga\u0000ons for payment of all principal, interest,\nand any applicable prepayment compensa\u0000on amount, are guaranteed by (i) Woodward FST, Inc., Woodward MPC, Inc., and Woodward HRT, Inc., each of\nwhich is a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward, and (ii) in the case of the BV Subsidiary’s Series N and O Notes, by Woodward. Woodward’s obliga\u0000ons\nunder the Notes rank equal in right of payment with all of Woodward’s other unsecured unsubordinated debt, including its outstanding debt under its\nrevolving credit facility.\nThe Notes contain restric\u0000ve covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, covenants that place limits on Woodward’s ability\nto incur liens on assets, incur addi\u0000onal debt (including a leverage or coverage-based maintenance test), transfer or sell Woodward’s assets, merge or\nconsolidate with other persons and enter into material transac\u0000ons with affiliates. Under the financial covenants contained in the note purchase agreement\ngoverning each series of the Notes, Woodward’s priority debt may not exceed, at any \u0000me, 15% of its consolidated net worth. Woodward’s Leverage Ra\u0000o\ncannot exceed 4.0 to 1.0 during any material acquisi\u0000on period, or 3.5 to 1.0 at any other \u0000me on a rolling four quarter basis. In the event that Woodward’s\nLeverage Ra\u0000o exceeds 3.5 to 1.0 during any material acquisi\u0000on period, the interest rate on each series of Notes will increase. The minimum consolidated net\nworth, prior year posi\u0000ve net income, and net cash proceeds resul\u0000ng from certain issuances of stock for sa\u0000sfac\u0000on of Woodward’s leverage ra\u0000o are\nconsistent between the Notes and Revolving Credit Agreement.\nRequired future principal payments of the Notes and financing leases as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:\nYear Ending September 30:\n2025 $ 85,719\n2026 119,658\n2027 85,021\n2028 87,209\n2029 75,000\nTherea\u0000er 203,753\n$ 656,360\n71\nCertain financial and other covenants under Woodward’s debt agreements contain customary restric\u0000ons on the opera\u0000on of its business. Management\nbelieves that Woodward was in compliance with the covenants under the long-term debt agreements at September 30, 2024.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nIn connec\u0000on with the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, Woodward incurred $2,236 in debt issuance costs, which are\ndeferred and are being amor\u0000zed using the straight-line method over the life of the agreement. Amounts recognized as interest expense from the amor\u0000za\u0000on\nof debt issuance costs were $929 in fiscal year 2024, $963 in fiscal year 2023, and $917 in fiscal year 2022. Unamor\u0000zed debt issuance costs associated with\nthe Notes of $890 as of September 30, 2024 and $1,145 as of September 30, 2023 were recorded as a reduc\u0000on in “Long-term debt, less current por\u0000on” in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unamor\u0000zed debt issuance costs associated with Woodward’s Revolving Credit Agreements of $1,977 as of September 30,\n2024 and $2,636 as of September 30, 2023 were recorded as “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amor\u0000za\u0000on of debt issuance costs is\nincluded in opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nNote 16.

Accruals are established for specifically\niden\u0000fied warranty issues and related liabili\u0000es that are probable to result in future costs. Warranty costs are accrued as revenue is recognized on a non-\nspecific basis whenever past experience indicates a normal and predictable pa\u0000ern exists. Changes in accrued product warran\u0000es and related liabili\u0000es were as\nfollows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nBeginning of period $ 18,162 $ 40,042 $ 17,481\nAddi\u0000ons, net of recoveries 13,797 25,984 29,827\nReduc\u0000ons for se\u0000lement (13,368) (47,949) (6,937)\nForeign currency exchange rate changes 253 85 (329)\nEnd of period $ 18,844 $ 18,162 $ 40,042\nRestructuring charges\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company commi\u0000ed to a cost reduc\u0000on plan (\"Cost Reduc\u0000on Plan\") to be\u0000er align the cost structure and recorded $5,172\nof restructuring charges. The charges recognized under the Cost Reduc\u0000on Plan consist of workforce management costs primarily related to aligning the cost\nstructure of the Company's Industrial segment with the current market condi\u0000ons. All of the restructuring charges were recorded as nonsegment expenses\nand were paid as of September 30, 2023.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company determined to implement a streamlined Aerospace and Industrial organiza\u0000onal and leadership structure designed to\nenhance the sales experience for customers, simplify opera\u0000ons, and increase profitability through improved execu\u0000on. In connec\u0000on with leadership changes\narising from such reorganiza\u0000on, we recorded $1,083 of restructuring charges as nonsegment expenses and were paid as of September 30, 2023.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded aggregate restructuring charges totaling $5,008 as nonsegment expenses for two separate workforce\nmanagement ac\u0000ons, one in our hydraulics systems business and one in our engine systems business. In fiscal year 2022, we experienced a challenging\nopera\u0000ng environment that included the ongoing impact of global supply chain and labor disrup\u0000ons, along with high infla\u0000on, which resulted in changed\nbusiness condi\u0000ons as compared to when we ini\u0000ally recorded the restructuring charges in fiscal year 2021. We adapted to the changed business condi\u0000ons\nby, among other ini\u0000a\u0000ves, (i) developing and implemen\u0000ng plans to insource select machined components, (ii)\n72\nredeploying talent and adding indirect resources to our factories to stabilize the produc\u0000on environment, and (iii) determining to retain employees that\notherwise would have been impacted by the planned restructuring ac\u0000vi\u0000es to support a stable workforce and effec\u0000vely manage through a\u0000ri\u0000on. As such,\nthe remaining unpaid accrued restructuring charges, which amounted to $4,503, were no longer needed and were reversed.\nThe summary of ac\u0000vity in accrued restructuring charges is as follows:\nPeriod Ac\u0000vity\nSeptember 30, Non-cash September 30,\n2022 Charges Payments ac\u0000vity 2023\nWorkforce management costs associated with:\nCost reduc\u0000on plan $ — $ 5,172 $ (5,207) $ 35 $ —\nAerospace 139 — (139) — —\nIndustrial 944 — (944) — —\nTotal $ 1,083 $ 5,172 $ (6,290) $ 35 $ —\nThere were no restructuring charges during the year ended September 30, 2024.\nNote 17.

The\nmajority of the NOL carryforwards as of September 30, 2024 expire at various \u0000mes beginning in fiscal years 2027 through 2029.\nWoodward has recorded tax credits and incen\u0000ves deferred tax assets of $30,886 as of September 30, 2024 and $28,319 as of September 30, 2023. The\nmajority of the tax credit and incen\u0000ve carryforwards as of September 30, 2024 expire at various \u0000mes beginning in fiscal year 2025 through 2035.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valua\u0000on allowance when the realiza\u0000on of the deferred tax asset is less than 50 percent likely. Both posi\u0000ve and\nnega\u0000ve evidence are considered in forming Woodward’s judgment as to whether a valua\u0000on allowance is appropriate, and more weight is given to evidence\nthat can be objec\u0000vely verified. Valua\u0000on allowances are reassessed whenever there are changes in circumstances that may cause a change in judgment.\nThe change in the valua\u0000on allowance was primarily the result of adjus\u0000ng an exis\u0000ng valua\u0000on allowance for a current year foreign net opera\u0000ng loss\nthat we assess is not realizable.\nAt September 30, 2024, Woodward has not provided for taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of $361,600 that it considered indefinitely reinvested.\nThis balance has been reduced for foreign earnings that are now considered distributable and resulted in the booking of an associated net deferred tax liability\nof approximately $6,100 in the quarter. These earnings could become subject to income taxes if they are remi\u0000ed as dividends, are loaned to Woodward or\nany of Woodward’s subsidiaries located in the United States, or if Woodward sells its stock in the foreign subsidiaries. Any addi\u0000onal U.S. taxes could be offset,\nin part or in whole, by foreign tax credits. The amount of such taxes and applica\u0000on of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other\ncircumstances at the \u0000me these amounts are repatriated. Based on these variables, it is imprac\u0000cal to determine the income tax liability that might be\nincurred if these funds were to be repatriated.\n74\nThe following is a reconcilia\u0000on of the U.S. federal statutory tax 21% in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, September 30, 2023, and September\n30, 2022 to Woodward’s effec\u0000ve income tax rate:\nYear Ending September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nPercent of pretax earnings\nStatutory tax rate 21.0% 21.0% 21.0%\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit (0.4) (1.6) (2.5)\nTaxes on interna\u0000onal ac\u0000vi\u0000es (0.8) (0.6) 0.8\nResearch credit (2.1) (3.9) (4.5)\nNet excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensa\u0000on (3.0) (3.7) (2.5)\nAdjustments of prior period tax items 0.9 (1.3) —\nCompensa\u0000on and benefits 0.8 0.6 0.3\nDistributable foreign earnings 1.4 4.6 —\nOther items, net — 0.6 1.5\nEffec\u0000ve tax rate 17.8% 15.7% 14.1%\nIn determining the tax amounts in Woodward’s financial statements, es\u0000mates are some\u0000mes used that are subsequently adjusted in the actual filing of\ntax returns or by updated calcula\u0000ons. In addi\u0000on, Woodward occasionally has resolu\u0000ons of tax items with tax authori\u0000es related to prior years due to the\nconclusion of audits and the lapse of applicable statutes of limita\u0000ons. Such adjustments are included in the “Adjustments of prior period tax items” line in the\nabove table.\nThe increase in the effec\u0000ve tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is primarily a\u0000ributable to a smaller research and development\ncredit, smaller net excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensa\u0000on as percent of current year earnings, fewer resolu\u0000ons of tax items with taxing\nauthori\u0000es in the current fiscal year, and increased return to provision items in the current fiscal year. This increase is par\u0000ally offset by smaller current fiscal\nyear projected future withholding taxes on unremi\u0000ed earnings.\nA reconcilia\u0000on of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:\nYear Ending September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 11,112 $ 11,938 $ 15,199\nAddi\u0000ons to current year tax posi\u0000ons 5,673 3,933 1,783\nReduc\u0000ons to prior year tax posi\u0000ons (99) (141) (963)\nAddi\u0000ons to prior year tax posi\u0000ons 180 — 112\nLapse of applicable statute of limita\u0000ons (2,592) (4,618) (4,193)\nEnding balance $ 14,274 $ 11,112 $ 11,938\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were $8,003 as of September 30, 2024 and $6,963 as of September 30, 2023 of tax benefits that, if\nrecognized, would affect the effec\u0000ve tax rate. At this \u0000me, Woodward es\u0000mates that it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits\nwill decrease by as much as $1,909 in the next twelve months due to the comple\u0000on of review by tax authori\u0000es, lapses of statutes, and the se\u0000lement of tax\nposi\u0000ons. Woodward accrues for poten\u0000al interest and penal\u0000es related to unrecognized tax benefits and all other interest and penal\u0000es related to tax\npayments in tax expense.\nWoodward’s tax returns are subject to audits by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authori\u0000es, and these audits are at various stages of comple\u0000on at\nany given \u0000me. Reviews of tax ma\u0000ers by authori\u0000es and lapses of the applicable statutes of limita\u0000on may result in changes to tax expense.

Re\u0000rement benefits\nWoodward provides various re\u0000rement benefits to eligible members of the Company, including contribu\u0000ons to various defined contribu\u0000on plans,\npension benefits associated with defined benefit plans, postre\u0000rement medical benefits, and postre\u0000rement life insurance benefits. Eligibility requirements\nand benefit levels vary depending on employee loca\u0000on.\n75\nDefined contribu\u0000on plans\nMost of the Company’s U.S. employees are eligible to par\u0000cipate in the U.S. defined contribu\u0000on plan. The U.S. defined contribu\u0000on plan allows\nemployees to defer part of their annual income for income tax purposes into their personal 401(k) accounts. The Company makes matching contribu\u0000ons to\neligible employee accounts, which are also deferred for employee personal income tax purposes. Certain non-U.S. employees are also eligible to par\u0000cipate in\nsimilar non-U.S. plans.\nMost of Woodward's U.S. employees receive an annual contribu\u0000on of Woodward stock, equal to 5% of their eligible prior year wages, to their personal\nWoodward Re\u0000rement Savings Plan accounts. In the second quarters of fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, Woodward fulfilled its annual Woodward stock\ncontribu\u0000on obliga\u0000on using shares held in treasury stock by issuing a total of 159 shares of common stock for a value of $21,889 in fiscal year 2024, 188 total\nshares of common stock for a value of $19,466 in fiscal year 2023, and 150 shares of common stock for a value of $17,132 in fiscal year 2022. The Woodward\nRe\u0000rement Savings Plan (the “WRS Plan”) held 2,222 shares of Woodward stock as of September 30, 2024 and 2,441 shares as of September 30, 2023. The\nshares held in the WRS Plan par\u0000cipate in dividends and are considered issued and outstanding for purposes of calcula\u0000ng basic and diluted earnings per\nshare. Accrued liabili\u0000es included obliga\u0000ons to contribute shares of Woodward common stock to the WRS Plan in the amount of $19,532 as of September 30,\n2024 and $16,634 as of September 30, 2023.\nThe amount of expense associated with defined contribu\u0000on plans was as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nCompany costs $ 51,148 $ 44,202 $ 40,898\nDefined benefit plans\nWoodward has defined benefit plans that provide pension benefits for certain re\u0000red employees in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and\nGermany. Woodward also provides other postre\u0000rement benefits to its employees including postre\u0000rement medical benefits and life insurance benefits.\nPostre\u0000rement medical benefits are provided to certain current and re\u0000red employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries in the United States\nand the United Kingdom. Life insurance benefits are provided to certain re\u0000rees in the United States under frozen plans, which are no longer available to\ncurrent employees. A September 30 measurement date is u\u0000lized to value plan assets and obliga\u0000ons for all of Woodward’s defined benefit pension and other\npostre\u0000rement benefit plans.\nExcluding the Woodward HRT Plan, which is only par\u0000ally frozen to salaried par\u0000cipants, the defined benefit plans in the United States were frozen in\nfiscal year 2007; no addi\u0000onal employees may par\u0000cipate in the U.S. plans, and no addi\u0000onal service costs will be incurred.\nPension Plans\nThe actuarial assump\u0000ons used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obliga\u0000ons of re\u0000rement pension benefits were as follows:\nAt September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nUnited States:\nWeighted-average assump\u0000ons to determine benefit obliga\u0000on:\nDiscount rate 5.05% 6.20% 5.70%\nWeighted-average assump\u0000ons to determine periodic benefit costs:\nDiscount rate 6.20 5.70 3.05\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets 6.03 5.53 5.00\nThe discount rate assump\u0000on is intended to reflect the rate at which the re\u0000rement benefits could be effec\u0000vely se\u0000led based upon the assumed \u0000ming\nof the benefit payments.\n76\nIn the United States, Woodward uses a bond por\u0000olio matching analysis based on recently traded, non-callable bonds rated AA or be\u0000er that have at\nleast $50 million outstanding to determine the benefit obliga\u0000ons at year end.\nAt September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nUnited Kingdom:\nWeighted-average assump\u0000ons to determine benefit obliga\u0000on:\nDiscount rate 5.28% 5.85% 5.35%\nRate of compensa\u0000on increase 3.40 3.60 4.00\nWeighted-average assump\u0000ons to determine periodic benefit costs:\nDiscount rate - service cost 5.91 4.99 2.15\nDiscount rate - interest cost 5.84 5.71 1.83\nRate of compensa\u0000on increase 3.60 4.00 4.00\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets 4.90 4.80 3.80\nAt September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nJapan:\nWeighted-average assump\u0000ons to determine benefit obliga\u0000on:\nDiscount rate 1.92% 2.01% 1.60%\nRate of compensa\u0000on increase 3.00 2.00 2.00\nWeighted-average assump\u0000ons to determine periodic benefit costs:\nDiscount rate - service cost 2.20 1.78 1.13\nDiscount rate - interest cost 1.58 1.17 0.65\nRate of compensa\u0000on increase 2.00 2.00 2.25\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets 3.25 2.75 2.00\nAt September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nGermany:\nWeighted-average assump\u0000ons to determine benefit obliga\u0000on:\nDiscount rate 3.58% 4.27% 3.97%\nRate of compensa\u0000on increase 2.50 2.50 2.50\nWeighted-average assump\u0000ons to determine periodic benefit costs:\nDiscount rate - service cost 4.23 3.95 1.54\nDiscount rate - interest cost 4.29 3.91 1.06\nRate of compensa\u0000on increase 2.50 2.50 2.50\nIn the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, Woodward uses a high-quality corporate bond yield curve matched with separate cash flows to develop a\nsingle rate to determine the single rate equivalent to se\u0000le the en\u0000re benefit obliga\u0000ons in each jurisdic\u0000on. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, the discount rate used to determine periodic service cost and interest cost components of the overall benefit costs was based on spot rates derived\nfrom the same high-quality corporate bond yield curve used to determine the September 30, 2023 and 2022 benefit obliga\u0000on, respec\u0000vely, matched with\nseparate cash flows for each future year.\nCompensa\u0000on increase assump\u0000ons, where applicable, are based upon historical experience and an\u0000cipated future management ac\u0000ons.\nIn determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, Woodward assumes that the historical long-term compound growth rates of equity and fixed-\nincome securi\u0000es will predict the future returns of similar investments in the plan por\u0000olio. Investment management and other fees paid out of the plan\nassets are factored into the determina\u0000on of asset return assump\u0000ons.\nMortality assump\u0000ons are based on published mortality studies developed primarily based on past experience of the broad popula\u0000on and modified for\nprojected longevity trends. The projected benefit obliga\u0000ons in the United States as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were based on the\nSociety of Actuaries (“SOA”) Pri-2012 Mortality Tables Report using the SOA’s Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2019 (“MP-2019”) and projected forward using\na custom projec\u0000on scale based on MP-2019 with a 5-year convergence period and a long-term rate of 0.75%.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, mortality assump\u0000ons in Japan were based on the Standard rates 2020, and mortality assump\u0000ons\nfor the United Kingdom pension scheme were based on the self-administered pension\n77\nscheme (“SAPS”) S3 “all” tables with a projected 1.5% annual improvement rate. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, mortality assump\u0000ons in\nGermany were based on the Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables.\nNet periodic benefit costs consist of the following components reflected as expense in Woodward’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings:\nYear Ended September 30,\nUnited States Other Countries Total\n2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022\nService cost $ 775 $ 893 $ 1,554 $ 1,244 $ 1,333 $ 2,339 $ 2,019 $ 2,226 $ 3,893\nInterest cost 7,598 7,297 5,281 3,213 3,137 1,612 10,811 10,434 6,893\nExpected return on plan assets (9,084) (8,297) (10,853) (2,406) (2,300) (2,434) (11,490) (10,597) (13,287)\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on of:\nNet loss (gain) 226 292 259 (679) (620) 555 (453) (328) 814\nNet prior service cost 698 698 981 23 22 23 721 720 1,004\nNet periodic cost (benefit) $ 213 $ 883 $ (2,778) $ 1,395 $ 1,572 $ 2,095 $ 1,608 $ 2,455 $ (683)\nThe following tables provide a reconcilia\u0000on of the changes in the projected benefit obliga\u0000on and fair value of assets for the defined benefit pension\nplans:\nAt or for the Year Ended September 30,\nUnited States Other Countries Total\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nChanges in projected benefit obliga\u0000on:\nProjected benefit obliga\u0000on at beginning of year $ 127,222 $ 132,444 $ 67,263 $ 65,477 $ 194,485 $ 197,921\nPlan amendment 1,121 — — — 1,121 —\nService cost 775 893 1,244 1,333 2,019 2,226\nInterest cost 7,598 7,297 3,213 3,137 10,811 10,434\nNet actuarial losses (gains) 13,249 (4,946) 4,128 (4,442) 17,377 (9,388)\nContribu\u0000on by par\u0000cipants — — 12 11 12 11\nBenefits paid (9,010) (8,466) (3,647) (3,365) (12,657) (11,831)\nForeign currency exchange rate changes — — 5,134 5,112 5,134 5,112\nProjected benefit obliga\u0000on at end of year $ 140,955 $ 127,222 $ 77,347 $ 67,263 $ 218,302 $ 194,485\nChanges in fair value of plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 155,370 $ 154,481 $ 50,775 $ 47,579 $ 206,145 $ 202,060\nActual return on plan assets 33,382 9,355 3,866 573 37,248 9,928\nContribu\u0000ons by the Company 175 — 1,863 2,322 2,038 2,322\nContribu\u0000ons by plan par\u0000cipants — — 12 11 12 11\nBenefits paid (9,010) (8,466) (3,647) (3,365) (12,657) (11,831)\nForeign currency exchange rate changes — — 4,607 3,655 4,607 3,655\nFair value of plan assets at end of year $ 179,917 $ 155,370 $ 57,476 $ 50,775 $ 237,393 $ 206,145\nNet over/(under) funded status at end of year $ 38,962 $ 28,148 $ (19,871) $ (16,488) $ 19,091 $ 11,660\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company’s defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany represented $34,220, $6,747, and\n$36,380 of the total projected benefit obliga\u0000on, respec\u0000vely.

The German pension plans are unfunded and have no plan assets.\nThe largest contributor to the net actuarial losses affec\u0000ng the funded status for the defined benefit pension plans in the United States, United Kingdom,\nJapan, and Germany is due to a decrease in the discount rates.\nThe accumulated benefit obliga\u0000ons of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans at September 30, 2024 was $140,955 in the United States, $33,766\nin the United Kingdom, $5,958 in Japan, and $36,380 in Germany, and at September 30, 2023 was $127,222 in the United States, $30,067 in the United\nKingdom, $5,790 in Japan, and $30,547 in Germany.\n78\nPlans with accumulated Plans with accumulated\nbenefit obliga\u0000on in benefit obliga\u0000on less\nexcess of plan assets than plan assets\nAt September 30, At September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProjected benefit obliga\u0000on $ (56,783) $ (49,726) $ (161,519) $ (144,759)\nAccumulated benefit obliga\u0000on (56,757) (49,711) (160,302) (143,914)\nFair value of plan assets 20,053 18,047 217,340 188,098\nThe following tables provide the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and accumulated other comprehensive (earnings) losses for\nthe defined benefit pension plans:\nYear Ended September 30,\nUnited States Other Countries Total\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist\nof:\nOther non-current assets $ 39,148 $ 29,172 $ 16,673 $ 14,167 $ 55,821 $ 43,339\nAccrued liabili\u0000es — — (1,166) (1,084) (1,166) (1,084)\nOther non-current liabili\u0000es (186) (1,024) (35,378) (29,571) (35,564) (30,595)\nNet over/(under) funded status at end of year $ 38,962 $ 28,148 $ (19,871) $ (16,488) $ 19,091 $ 11,660\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other\ncomprehensive (earnings) losses consist of:\nUnrecognized net prior service cost $ 3,200 $ 2,777 $ 509 $ 487 $ 3,709 $ 3,264\nUnrecognized net losses (gains) (2,749) 8,527 (4,655) (7,847) (7,404) 680\nTotal amounts recognized 451 11,304 (4,146) (7,360) (3,695) 3,944\nDeferred taxes (3,499) (6,101) (191) 808 (3,690) (5,293)\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive\n(earnings) losses $ (3,048) $ 5,203 $ (4,337) $ (6,552) $ (7,385) $ (1,349)\nThe following table reconciles the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (earnings) losses for the defined benefit pension plans:\nYear Ended September 30,\nUnited States Other Countries Total\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning of year $ 11,304 $ 18,297 $ (7,360) $ (4,997) $ 3,944 $ 13,300\nNet (gain) loss (11,050) (6,003) 2,668 (2,716) (8,382) (8,719)\nPrior service cost 1,121 — — — 1,121 —\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on of:\nNet (loss) gain (226) (292) 679 620 453 328\nPrior service cost (698) (698) (23) (22) (721) (720)\nForeign currency exchange rate changes — — (110) (245) (110) (245)\nEnd of year $ 451 $ 11,304 $ (4,146) $ (7,360) $ (3,695) $ 3,944\nPension benefit payments are made from the assets of the pension plans. The German pension plans are unfunded; therefore, benefit payments are\nmade from Company contribu\u0000ons into these plans as required to meet the payment obliga\u0000ons.

The strategy for each of the plans balances the requirements to generate returns, using investments\nexpected to produce higher returns, such as equity securi\u0000es, with the need to control risk within the pension plans using less vola\u0000le investment assets, such\nas debt securi\u0000es. A strategy of more equity-oriented alloca\u0000on is adopted for those plans which have a longer-term investment plan based on the \u0000ming of\nthe associated benefit obliga\u0000ons.\nRisks associated with the plan assets include interest rate fluctua\u0000on risk, market fluctua\u0000on risk, risk of default by debt issuers, and liquidity risk. To\nmanage these risks, the assets are managed by established, professional investment firms and performance is evaluated regularly by the Company’s\ninvestment commi\u0000ee against specific benchmarks and each plan’s investment objec\u0000ves. Liability management and asset class diversifica\u0000on are central to\nthe Company’s risk management approach and overall investment strategy.\nThe assets of the U.S. plans are invested in ac\u0000vely managed mutual funds. The assets of the plans in the United Kingdom and Japan are invested in\nac\u0000vely managed pooled investment funds. Each individual mutual fund or pooled investment fund has been selected based on the investment strategy of the\nrelated plan, which mirrors a specific asset class within the associated target alloca\u0000on.

Life insurance\nbenefits are also provided to certain re\u0000rees in the United States under frozen plans which are no longer available to current employees. A September 30\nmeasurement date is u\u0000lized to value plan assets and obliga\u0000ons for Woodward’s other postre\u0000rement benefit plans.\nThe postre\u0000rement medical benefit plans, other than the plan assumed in an acquisi\u0000on in fiscal year 2009, were frozen in fiscal year 2006, and no\naddi\u0000onal employees may par\u0000cipate in the plans. Generally, employees who had a\u0000ained age 55 and had rendered 10 or more years of service before the\nplans were frozen were eligible for these postre\u0000rement medical benefits.\nCertain par\u0000cipa\u0000ng re\u0000rees are required to contribute to the plans in order to maintain coverage. The plans provide postre\u0000rement medical benefits\nfor approximately 3 re\u0000red employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries and may provide future benefits to 347 ac\u0000ve employees and their\ncovered dependents and beneficiaries, upon re\u0000rement, if the employees elect to par\u0000cipate. All the postre\u0000rement medical plans are fully insured for\nre\u0000rees who have a\u0000ained age 65.\nThe actuarial assump\u0000ons used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obliga\u0000ons of postre\u0000rement benefits were as follows:\nAt September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nWeighted-average discount rate used to determine benefit obliga\u0000on 5.00% 6.25% 5.70%\nWeighted-average discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost 6.25 5.70 2.80\nThe discount rate assump\u0000on is intended to reflect the rate at which the postre\u0000rement benefits could be effec\u0000vely se\u0000led based upon the assumed\n\u0000ming of the benefit payments.\nWoodward used a bond por\u0000olio matching analysis based on recently traded, non-callable bonds rated AA or be\u0000er that have at least $50 million\noutstanding to determine the benefit obliga\u0000ons at year end.\nMortality assump\u0000ons are based on published mortality studies developed primarily based on past experience of the broad popula\u0000on and modified for\nprojected longevity trends. The projected benefit obliga\u0000ons in the United States as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were based on the SOA\nPri-2012 Mortality Tables Report using the SOA’s MP-2019 and projected forward using a custom projec\u0000on scale based on MP-2019 with a 5-year convergence\nperiod and a long-term rate of 0.75%.\nAssumed healthcare cost trend rates at September 30, were as follows:\n2024 2023\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.00% 6.00%\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline\n(the ul\u0000mate trend rate) 5.00% 5.00%\nYear that the rate reaches the ul\u0000mate trend rate 2030 2030\n82\nNet periodic benefit costs consist of the following components reflected as expense in Woodward’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nService cost $ — $ 1 $ 1\nInterest cost 902 904 577\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on of:\nNet gain (555) (495) (94)\nNet periodic cost $ 347 $ 410 $ 484\nThe following table provides a reconcilia\u0000on of the changes in the accumulated postre\u0000rement benefit obliga\u0000on and fair value of assets for the\npostre\u0000rement benefits:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nChanges in accumulated postre\u0000rement benefit obliga\u0000on:\nAccumulated postre\u0000rement benefit obliga\u0000on at beginning of year $ 15,336 $ 16,797\nService cost — 1\nInterest cost 902 904\nPremiums paid by plan par\u0000cipants 834 873\nNet actuarial loss (gain) 597 (682)\nBenefits paid (2,466) (2,557)\nAccumulated postre\u0000rement benefit obliga\u0000on at end of year $ 15,203 $ 15,336\nChanges in fair value of plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ — $ —\nContribu\u0000ons by the company 1,632 1,684\nPremiums paid by plan par\u0000cipants 834 873\nBenefits paid (2,466) (2,557)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year $ — $ —\nFunded status at end of year $ (15,203) $ (15,336)\nThe following tables provide the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and accumulated other comprehensive (earnings) losses for\nthe postre\u0000rement plans:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nAmounts recognized in Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of:\nAccrued liabili\u0000es $ (1,668) $ (1,739)\nOther non-current liabili\u0000es (13,535) (13,597)\nFunded status at end of year $ (15,203) $ (15,336)\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income consist of:\nUnrecognized net prior service cost (benefit) $ — $ —\nUnrecognized net gains (5,260) (6,412)\nTotal amounts recognized (5,260) (6,412)\nDeferred taxes 1,009 1,292\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (earnings) $ (4,251) $ (5,120)\nWoodward pays plan benefits from its general funds; therefore, there are no segregated plan assets as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023.\nThe accumulated benefit obliga\u0000ons of the Company’s postre\u0000rement plans were $15,203 at September 30, 2024 and $15,336 at September 30, 2023.\nThe largest contributor to the actuarial loss affec\u0000ng the Company’s postre\u0000rement plans accumulated benefit obliga\u0000ons was a decrease in the discount rate.\n83\nThe following table reconciles the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (earnings) losses for the other postre\u0000rement benefit plans:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nBeginning of year $ (6,412) $ (6,225)\nNet loss (gain) 597 (682)\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on of:\nNet gain 555 495\nEnd of year $ (5,260) $ (6,412)\nUsing expected future service, it is an\u0000cipated that the future Company contribu\u0000ons to pay benefits for other postre\u0000rement benefit plans, excluding\npar\u0000cipate contribu\u0000ons, will be as follows:\nYear Ending September 30,\n2025 $ 2,519\n2026 2,447\n2027 2,357\n2028 2,267\n2029 2,171\n2030-2034 9,101\nNote 21.

Pursuant to the form agreements\nused by the Company, with terms approved by the administrator of the applicable plan, the requisite service period can be less than the four-year ves\u0000ng\nperiod based on grantee’s re\u0000rement eligibility. As such, the recogni\u0000on of stock-based compensa\u0000on expense associated with some grants can be accelerated\nto a period of less than four years, including immediate recogni\u0000on of stock-based compensa\u0000on expense on the date of grant.\nStock-based compensa\u0000on expense recognized was as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nEmployee stock-based compensa\u0000on expense $ 33,052 $ 23,958 $ 20,109\nIn connec\u0000on with an execu\u0000ve separa\u0000on and release agreement entered into by the Company, Woodward recognized an addi\u0000onal $1,682 and $1,265\nof stock-based compensa\u0000on expense, before tax, during fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023, respec\u0000vely.\nAt September 30, 2024, there was approximately $26,694 of total unrecognized compensa\u0000on expense related to non-vested stock-based compensa\u0000on\narrangements, including stock op\u0000ons, restricted stock, and performance stock awards. The pre-ves\u0000ng forfeiture rates for purposes of determining stock-\nbased compensa\u0000on expense recognized were es\u0000mated to be 0.0% for members of Woodward’s Board and 7.4% for all others. The remaining unrecognized\ncompensa\u0000on cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.79 years.\nNote 22. Commitments and con\u0000ngencies\nWoodward enters into uncondi\u0000onal purchase obliga\u0000on arrangements (i.e., issuance of purchase orders, obliga\u0000ons to transfer funds in the future for\nfixed or minimum quan\u0000\u0000es of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as\n87\n\"take-or-pay\" contracts) in the normal course of business to ensure that adequate levels of sourced product are available to Woodward. Future minimum\nuncondi\u0000onal purchase obliga\u0000ons are as follows:\nYear Ending September 30:\n2025 $ 676,009\n2026 179,213\n2027 70,212\n2028 1,542\n2029 5\nTherea\u0000er 88\nTotal $ 927,069\nThe U.S. Government, and other governments, may terminate any of Woodward’s government contracts (and, in general, subcontracts) at their\nconvenience, as well as for default based on specified performance measurements. If any of Woodward’s government contracts were to be terminated for\nconvenience, the Company generally would be en\u0000tled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termina\u0000on or cancella\u0000on costs. If any of\nWoodward’s government contracts were to be terminated for Woodward’s default, the U.S. Government generally would pay only for the work accepted and\ncould require Woodward to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted\nfrom the original contract. The U.S. Government could also hold Woodward liable for damages resul\u0000ng from the default.\nWoodward is currently involved in claims, pending or threatened li\u0000ga\u0000on or other legal proceedings, inves\u0000ga\u0000ons, and/or regulatory proceedings\narising in the normal course of business, including, among others, those rela\u0000ng to product liability claims, employment ma\u0000ers, worker’s compensa\u0000on\nclaims, contractual disputes, product warranty claims, and alleged viola\u0000ons of various laws and regula\u0000ons. Woodward accrues for known individual ma\u0000ers\nusing es\u0000mates of the most likely amount of loss where it believes that it is probable the ma\u0000er will result in a loss when ul\u0000mately resolved and such loss is\nreasonably es\u0000mable. Legal costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in “Selling, general, and administra\u0000ve expenses” on the Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings.\nWoodward is par\u0000ally self-insured in the United States for healthcare and worker’s compensa\u0000on up to predetermined amounts, above which third\nparty insurance applies. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of related claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the\navailability and limits of the insurance coverage, and the established accruals for liabili\u0000es.\nWhile the outcome of pending claims, legal and regulatory proceedings, and inves\u0000ga\u0000ons cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes\nthat any liabili\u0000es that may result from these claims, proceedings, and inves\u0000ga\u0000ons will not have a material effect on Woodward’s liquidity, financial\ncondi\u0000on, or results of opera\u0000ons.\nIn the event of a change in control of Woodward, as defined in change-in-control agreements with its current corporate officers, Woodward may be\nrequired to pay termina\u0000on benefits to any such officer if such officer’s employment is terminated within two years following the change of control.\nNote 23. Segment informa\u0000on\nWoodward serves the aerospace and industrial markets through its two reportable segments - Aerospace and Industrial. When appropriate,\nWoodward’s reportable segments are aggrega\u0000ons of Woodward’s opera\u0000ng segments. Woodward uses opera\u0000ng segment informa\u0000on internally to manage\nits business, including the assessment of opera\u0000ng segment performance and decisions for the alloca\u0000on of resources between opera\u0000ng segments.\nThe accoun\u0000ng policies of the reportable segments are the same as those of the Company. Woodward evaluates segment profit or loss based on\ninternal performance measures for each segment in a given period. In connec\u0000on with that assessment, Woodward generally excludes ma\u0000ers such as certain\ncharges for restructuring, interest income and expense, certain gains and losses from asset disposi\u0000ons, or other non-recurring and/or non-opera\u0000onally\nrelated expenses.\n88\nA summary of consolidated net sales and earnings by segment follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nSegment external net sales:\nAerospace $ 2,028,618 $ 1,768,103 $ 1,519,322\nIndustrial 1,295,631 1,146,463 863,468\nTotal consolidated net sales $ 3,324,249 $ 2,914,566 $ 2,382,790\nSegment earnings:\nAerospace $ 385,360 $ 290,104 $ 230,933\nIndustrial 229,857 161,622 82,788\nNonsegment expenses (119,745) (130,811) (81,092)\nInterest Expense, net (41,501) (45,147) (32,731)\nConsolidated earnings before income taxes $ 453,971 $ 275,768 $ 199,898\nSegment assets consist of accounts receivable, inventories, property, plant, and equipment, net, goodwill, and other intangibles, net.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants\nThere have been no disagreements or any reportable events requiring disclosure under Item 304(b) of Regula\u0000on S-K.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that informa\u0000on required to be disclosed in reports filed or\nsubmi\u0000ed under the Securi\u0000es Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the \u0000me periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limita\u0000on, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninforma\u0000on required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our\nPrincipal Execu\u0000ve Officer (Charles P.

Lacey, Chief Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow \u0000mely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nCharles P. Blankenship, Jr. and William F. Lacey evaluated the effec\u0000veness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered\nby this Form 10-K. Based on their evalua\u0000ons, they concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effec\u0000ve as of September 30, 2024.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Repor\u0000ng\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial repor\u0000ng (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the\nExchange Act) for the Company. Our management has evaluated the effec\u0000veness of internal control over financial repor\u0000ng using the criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Commi\u0000ee of Sponsoring Organiza\u0000ons of the Treadway Commission and, based on that\nevalua\u0000on, concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial repor\u0000ng was effec\u0000ve as of September 30, 2024, the end of the Company’s most\nrecent fiscal year.\nDeloi\u0000e & Touche LLP (PCAOB ID No. 34), an independent registered public accoun\u0000ng firm, conducted an audit of Woodward’s internal control over\nfinancial repor\u0000ng as of September 30, 2024 as stated in their report included in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n90\nInternal control over financial repor\u0000ng is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal execu\u0000ve and principal financial officers, or\npersons performing similar func\u0000ons, and effected by our Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of our financial repor\u0000ng and the prepara\u0000on of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accoun\u0000ng\nprinciples. Internal control over financial repor\u0000ng includes those policies and procedures that:\n• Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transac\u0000ons and disposi\u0000ons of the assets of the\nCompany;\n• Provide reasonable assurance that transac\u0000ons are recorded as necessary to permit prepara\u0000on of financial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accoun\u0000ng principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with\nauthoriza\u0000on of management and directors of the Company; and\n• Provide reasonable assurance regarding preven\u0000on or \u0000mely detec\u0000on of unauthorized acquisi\u0000on, use, or disposi\u0000on of the Company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial repor\u0000ng during the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial repor\u0000ng.\nItem 9B.

Holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to cumulative voting for the election of directors, which means that in each election of directors each holder of our common stock is\nentitled to cast as many votes as the number of shares of common stock held by such holder multiplied by the number of directors to be elected and may cast all\nsuch votes for the election of one nominee or distribute such votes among two or more nominees.\nIn an election for directors that is not a contested election, as defined in our certificate of incorporation, directors will be elected by a majority of the voting\npower cast in the election of directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered votes cast. In a contested election, directors will be elected by a\nplurality of the votes cast.\nDividend Rights\nHolders of common stock may receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by our board of directors at any regular or special meeting. Holders of common\nstock have no preemptive or redemption rights. All outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.\nPreferred Stock\nOur board of directors is authorized to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to fix the dividend rights and terms, conversion rights, voting rights,\nredemption rights and terms, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each series of preferred stock.\nThe number of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote\nof the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock without a vote of the holders of the shares of preferred stock, or of any series thereof,\nunless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the resolution or resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of the series of preferred\nstock.\nDelaware law provides that the holders of preferred stock have the right to vote separately as a class on any proposal involving fundamental changes in the\nrights of holders of that preferred stock. This right is in addition to any voting rights that may be provided for in the applicable certificate of designation for\npreferred stock.\nCertain Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nGeneral\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make more difficult the acquisition of control of Woodward by means of a tender offer,\nopen market purchases, a proxy contest or otherwise. A description of these provisions is set forth below.\nClassified Board of Directors; Removal Only for Cause\n-1-\nExhibit 4.2\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws divide our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving staggered, three-year terms. In\naddition, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-\nthirds of the outstanding shares of common stock. The classification of our board of directors means that, unless directors are removed for cause, it could\nrequire at least two annual meetings of stockholders for a majority of stockholders to make a change of control of the board of directors, because only a portion\nof the directors will be elected at each meeting. A significant effect of a classified board of directors may be to deter hostile takeover attempts, because an\nacquirer could experience delay in replacing a majority of the directors. A classified board of directors also makes it more difficult for stockholders to effect a\nchange of control of the board of directors, even if such a change of control were to be sought due to dissatisfaction with the performance of our directors.\nBoard Vacancies\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorizes our board of directors to fill vacant directorships or to increase the size of our board of directors, which\nmay deter a stockholder from removing incumbent directors and simultaneously gaining control of our board of directors by filling the vacancies created by this\nremoval with its own nominees.\nAdvance Notice of Director Nominees and Other Matters to Come Before Stockholder Meetings\nOur bylaws require stockholders to notify us prior to the date which is not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the\nimmediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders of any nominations they will propose for directors or other matters they wish to propose at the annual\nmeeting, subject to certain exceptions if the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date or the size of the\nboard of directors is increased. This provision may have the effect of precluding a nomination for the election of directors at a particular annual meeting if the\nproper procedures are not followed and may discourage or deter a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or\notherwise attempting to obtain control of Woodward.\nNo Stockholder Action by Written Consent\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that all action by stockholders must be taken at a meeting duly called and held. The stockholders may not act by\nwritten consent. This provision prevents our stockholders from initiating or effecting any action by written consent, thereby limiting the ability of our\nstockholders to take actions opposed by our board of directors.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called by the board of directors or the chairman of the board of\ndirectors, and when requested in writing and signed by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Such request must state the\npurpose of the proposed meeting and, in the case of a request by holders of outstanding common stock, must be delivered personally or sent by certified or\nregistered mail, return receipt requested, to the secretary of the corporation. Business transacted at all special meetings of stockholders must be confined to the\nmatters set forth in the notice. This provision could have the effect of inhibiting stockholder actions that require a special meeting of stockholders unless our\nboard of directors or chairman calls such a meeting.\nLimitation of Director Liability\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless otherwise prohibited under the Delaware General Corporation Law, no director will be liable to Woodward\nor to our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. The effect of this provision may be to reduce the likelihood of derivative\nlitigation against our directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited Woodward and our\nstockholders. This provision does not limit a stockholder’s ability to seek or obtain relief under federal securities laws.\nSupermajority Voting\n-2-\nExhibit 4.2\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock:\n• for the adoption of any amendment, alteration, change or repeal of any provision of the certificate of incorporation;\n• for the adoption of any agreement for the merger or consolidation of Woodward with or into any other corporation;\n• to authorize any sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of Woodward; and\n• to authorize the dissolution of Woodward.\nThe supermajority voting provision described above regarding any amendment, alteration, change or repeal of any provision of the certificate of incorporation is\nprimarily designed to prevent an acquirer from circumventing the takeover defense provisions contained in our governing documents. The other supermajority\nvoting provisions described above discourage attempts to take over the company by significant stockholders and may enable a minority of the stockholders to\nprevent consummation of significant business combinations or other transactions.\nOur certificate of incorporation also expressly authorizes each of our board of directors and our stockholders to independently adopt, amend or repeal our\nbylaws. However, our stockholders may only adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares\nof our common stock, and no bylaw may be adopted by the stockholders that impairs or impedes the power of the board of directors under the certificate of\nincorporation. This supermajority voting provision could enable holders of just over one-third of our common stock to prevent holders of a substantial majority\nof our common stock who do not approve of certain provisions of the bylaws from amending or repealing such provisions. This supermajority voting provision\nalso promotes continuity with respect to the management of our day-to-day operations and may prevent a purchaser who acquires a majority of the shares of our\ncommon stock from adopting bylaws that are not in the best interests of the minority stockholders or from repealing bylaws that are in such minority\nstockholders’ best interests.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares\nSubject to the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available\nfor future issuance without stockholder approval. These shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise\nadditional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock\ncould render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of our common stock by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or\notherwise.\nSection 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations from engaging in a\n“business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the time of the transaction in which the person or entity became an\ninterested stockholder, unless:\n• prior to that time, either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by\nthe board of directors of the corporation;\n• upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85%\nof the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, excluding for this purpose shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers of the\ncorporation and by specified employee benefit plans; or\n• at or after such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the\noutstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.\n-3-\nExhibit 4.2\nFor the purposes of Section 203, a “business combination” is broadly defined to include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial\nbenefit to the interested stockholder. An “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or within the immediately\npreceding three years owned 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock. The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control\nattempts with respect to us and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our capital stock is Equiniti Trust Company, LLC (“EQ”), 55 Challenger Road, Floor 2, Ridgefield Park, NJ 07660.\n-4-\nExhibit 10.40\nNon-Qualified Stock Option Agreement\nFor Non-Employee Directors\nTHIS NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”), entered into between you (the “Participant”) and\nWoodward, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), hereby grants an award of Non-Qualified Stock Options (or “options”) to the\nParticipant as of the grant date set forth in Section 1 below (the “Grant Date”) with reference to the facts described in the recitals below.\nCapitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Woodward, Inc.\n2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”).\nA.

Company’s Obligation to Pay. Each RSU represents the right to receive a Share on the date it vests. Unless and until the RSUs will have vested\nin the manner set forth in Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 of this Agreement, the Participant will have no right to payment of any such RSUs, nor any\nrights associated therewith, including dividend payments (subject to Sections 4 and 17 below) or voting rights.

The Dividend Equivalent RSUs shall be deemed to be reinvested in additional RSUs (which may thereafter accrue additional Dividend\nEquivalents). Each Dividend Equivalent RSU will vest on the same vesting date corresponding to the underlying RSU with respect to which it\nwas awarded, and will otherwise be subject to the same conditions applicable to the underlying RSUs. Unless expressly provided otherwise, as\nused elsewhere in this Agreement “RSUs” shall include any Dividend Equivalent RSUs that have been credited to Participant.\n5. Death and Disability.\n(a) Death of Participant. If the Participant dies before the RSUs granted hereunder vest pursuant to Section 3, then all RSUs granted hereunder\nwill become immediately vested on the date of the Participant’s death.\n(b) Disability of Participant.

Subject to Section 13, any RSUs (including Dividend Equivalent RSUs) that vest will be paid to the Participant (or in the event\nof the Participant’s death, to his or her properly designated beneficiary or estate) in whole Shares. Subject to the provisions of Section 7(b), such\nvested RSUs shall be paid in whole Shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case within sixty (60) days following the vesting\ndate. In no event will the Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to specify the taxable year of payment of any RSUs payable under this\nAgreement.\n(b) Acceleration.\n(i) Discretionary Acceleration. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the\nbalance, of the unvested RSUs at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan. If so accelerated, such RSUs will be considered as having vested as of\nthe date specified by the Administrator. If the Participant is a U.S. taxpayer, the payment of Shares vesting pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall in all\ncases be paid at a time or in a manner that is exempt from, or complies with, Section\nExhibit 10.41\n409A. The prior sentence may be superseded in a future agreement or amendment to this Agreement only by direct and specific reference to such\nsentence.\n(ii) “Specified Employees”. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement or any other agreement (whether entered into before, on or\nafter the Grant Date), if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the RSUs is accelerated in connection with the\nParticipant’s termination as a Service Provider (provided that such termination is a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A,\nas determined by the Company), other than due to the Participant’s death, and if (x) the Participant is a U.S. taxpayer and a “specified employee”\nwithin the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such termination as a Service Provider and (y) the payment of such accelerated RSUs will\nresult in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to the Participant on or within the six (6) month period following the\nParticipant’s termination as a Service Provider, then the payment of such accelerated RSUs will not be made until the date six (6) months and one\n(1) day following the date of the Participant’s termination as a Service Provider, unless the Participant dies following his or her termination as a\nService Provider, in which case, the RSUs will be paid in Shares to the Participant’s estate as soon as practicable following his or her death.\n(c) Section 409A. It is the intent of this Agreement that it and all payments and benefits to U.S. taxpayers hereunder be exempt from, or comply\nwith, the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the RSUs provided under this Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to\nthe additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or so comply. Each payment\npayable under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). However,\nin no event will the Company reimburse the Participant, or be otherwise responsible for, any taxes or costs that may be imposed on the Participant\nas a result of Section 409A.

All determina\u0000ons of the Board and/or Commi\u0000ee and any other administrator of the Policy will be final and binding on all\ninterested persons and will be given the maximum deference permi\u0000ed by law.\nCompensa\u0000on Covered by the Policy\nThis Policy applies to all Incen\u0000ve-Based Compensa\u0000on that is Received on or a\u0000er October 2, 2023 by a person (a) a\u0000er such\nindividual became an Execu\u0000ve Officer, (b) who was an Execu\u0000ve Officer at any \u0000me during the applicable performance period for that\nIncen\u0000ve-Based Compensa\u0000on, and (c) during the Covered Period (“Clawback Eligible Incen\u0000ve-Based Compensa\u0000on”).\nEvents Requiring Applica\u0000on of the Policy\nIf the Company is required to prepare an accoun\u0000ng restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial\nrepor\u0000ng requirement under the securi\u0000es laws, including any required accoun\u0000ng restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial\nstatements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error\nExhibit 97.1\nwere corrected in the current period or le\u0000 uncorrected in the current period (an “Accoun\u0000ng Restatement”); AND\nany Execu\u0000ve Officer has Received Clawback Eligible Incen\u0000ve-Based Compensa\u0000on that exceeds the amount of Incen\u0000ve-Based Compensa\u0000on\nthat otherwise would have been Received had such Incen\u0000ve-Based Compensa\u0000on been determined based on the restated amounts, computed\nwithout regard to any taxes paid by or on behalf of the Execu\u0000ve Officer (such compensa\u0000on, the “Excess Compensa\u0000on” (which the Nasdaq\nlis\u0000ng standards describe as erroneously awarded incen\u0000ve-based compensa\u0000on);\nthen, the Company will recover reasonably promptly the amount of such Excess Compensa\u0000on in compliance with this Policy unless an\nexcep\u0000on applies under this Policy.\nDetermining Excess Compensa\u0000on for Certain Incen\u0000ve-Based Compensa\u0000on\nTo determine the amount of Excess Compensa\u0000on for Incen\u0000ve-Based Compensa\u0000on based on stock price or total shareholder return, where it\nis not subject to mathema\u0000cal recalcula\u0000on directly from the informa\u0000on in an Accoun\u0000ng Restatement:\n• The amount must be based on a reasonable es\u0000mate of the effect of the Accoun\u0000ng Restatement on the stock price or total\nshareholder return upon which the Incen\u0000ve-Based Compensa\u0000on was Received; and\n• The Company must maintain documenta\u0000on of the determina\u0000on of that reasonable es\u0000mate and provide such\ndocumenta\u0000on to the Exchange.\nExcep\u0000ons to the Policy\nThe Company must recover the Excess Compensa\u0000on in accordance with this Policy, except to the limited extent that the condi\u0000ons set forth\nbelow are met and the Board and/or Commi\u0000ee has made a determina\u0000on that recovery of the Excess Compensa\u0000on would be imprac\u0000cable:\nA. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; provided, however, that\nprior to reaching this conclusion, the Company must make a reasonable a\u0000empt to recover such Excess Compensa\u0000on, document such\nreasonable a\u0000empt(s) to recover, and provide that documenta\u0000on to the Exchange; or\nB. Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; provided, however, that prior to\nreaching this conclusion, the Company must obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recovery would result\nin such a viola\u0000on, and must provide such opinion to the Exchange; or\nC. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified re\u0000rement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nCompany, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regula\u0000ons thereunder.\nDefined Terms in this Policy\nThe capitalized terms in this Policy have the following meaning, unless clearly required otherwise by the context.\nExhibit 97.1\n“Accoun\u0000ng Restatement” is defined in the “Events Requiring Applica\u0000on of the Policy” sec\u0000on of this Policy.\n“Accoun\u0000ng Restatement Determina\u0000on Date” means the earliest to occur of:\nA.
