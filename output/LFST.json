Key generational differences were evident, with younger individuals more likely to experience moderate to significant election-related anxiety. Additionally, nearly two-thirds (60%) of respondents who are currently in therapy say they have discussed politics or the election with their clinician during sessions.\n\nThese findings underscore the ongoing need for high-quality, accessible mental healthcare, as therapy plays a critical role in helping people effectively navigate election-related anxiety, develop healthy coping techniques and maintain their overall mental well-being during times of stress.

In fact, nearly two-thirds (60%) of respondents who are in therapy say they discuss politics or the election with their mental health clinician during sessions.\n\n\n\n**Political disagreements are meaningfully impacting relationships, causing conflict among friends and family and even ending friendships, all of which can significantly impact one's mental health.**\n\n  * Nearly half (44%) of respondents said political or election-related discussions have led to conflicts in their personal lives.\n  * This is especially true of younger generations: 29% percent of Gen Z and 25% of millennials say that discussing politics leads to conflicts \"always\" or \"often,\" compared to 12% of Gen X and 9% of baby boomers.\n  * Nearly a quarter (22%) of respondents said they have considered ending a friendship due to opposing political views, and 18% said they have done so before.\n\n\n\n**Differing political views are creating tension in romantic relationships and impacting who people choose to date.**\n\n  * Half (50%) of Gen Z say \"political compatibility\" is an important factor when considering who they date, compared with 42% of millennials, 31% of Gen X and 29% of baby boomers.\n  * One-third (33%) of respondents said they would not date someone with opposing political views, while more than a quarter (28%) would consider it a \"deal breaker\" if they found out someone they were currently dating had opposing political views.\n  * Nearly a quarter (24%) of Gen Z and (23%) millennials have ended a romantic relationship due to political disagreements at least once, compared to 10% of Gen X and 4% of baby boomers.\n\n\n\n**To cope with election anxiety, people are adjusting their social media habits and even blocking friends and family members.**\n\n  * Over one-third (34%) of respondents said they unfollowed or blocked a friend or family member on social media due to their political views, while 22% said they haven't but have considered it.\n  * Over two-thirds (72%) of respondents said social media and news coverage contribute to their anxiety about the election, and more than half (54%) limit their exposure to news and social media to manage election-related stress.\n  * More than half of Gen Z (52%) and 44% of millennials said social media and news coverage have moderately or significantly contributed to their anxiety about the election, compared to baby boomers (37%) and Gen X (35%).\n\n\n\n\"Election-related anxiety is just one example of the mounting mental health challenges people face in today's complex world,\" said Dr. Ujjwal Ramtekkar, Chief Medical Officer, LifeStance. \"Our survey highlights the ongoing need to improve access to high-quality mental health care, which would provide even more people with the tools to effectively manage daily life stressors, build long-term resilience and ultimately foster healthier, more resilient communities.\"\n\n**Methodology** On behalf of LifeStance Health, Researchscape International conducted an online survey of 1,052 U.S. adults aged 18 and older.

When used in this press release and on the related teleconference, words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “intend,” “potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “plan,” “target,” “predict,” “project,” “seek” and similar expressions as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events and results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: we may not grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all, even if our key metrics may imply future growth, including if we are unable to successfully execute on our growth initiatives and business strategies; if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our expenses could increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase proportionally or at all, and we may be unable to execute on our business strategy; our ability to recruit new clinicians and retain existing clinicians; if reimbursement rates paid by third-party payors are reduced or if third-party payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or deliver care to patients, our business could be harmed; we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; we are dependent on our relationships with supported practices, which we do not own, to provide health care services, and our business would be harmed if those relationships were disrupted or if our arrangements with these entities became subject to legal challenges; we operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed; the impact of health care reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in health care spending on us is currently unknown, but may harm our business; if our or our vendors’ security measures fail or are breached and unauthorized access to our employees’, patients’ or partners’ data is obtained, our systems may be perceived as insecure, we may incur significant liabilities, including through private litigation or regulatory action, our reputation may be harmed, and we could lose patients and partners; our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems; actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations; our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our business and growth prospects; and other risks and uncertainties set forth under “Risk Factors” included in the reports we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. LifeStance does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect any change in management's expectations or any change in the assumptions or circumstances on which such statements are based, except as otherwise required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Center Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Tables showing the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this release. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance, and may be helpful to securities analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in understanding the Company’s operating performance and prospects. This press release also refers to Free Cash Flow, which is calculated as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Management believes Free Cash Flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for future growth. These non-GAAP financial measures, as calculated, may not be comparable to companies in other industries or within the same industry with similarly titled measures of performance. Therefore, the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net loss or loss from operations.\n\nCenter Margin and Adjusted EBITDA anticipated for the third quarter of 2024 and full year 2024 are calculated in a manner consistent with the historical presentation of these measures at the end of this release. Reconciliation for the forward-looking third quarter of 2024 and full year 2024 Center Margin, Adjusted EBITDA guidance and Free Cash Flow is not being provided, as LifeStance does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation. As such, LifeStance management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results.\n\nManagement acknowledges that there are many items that impact a company’s reported results and the adjustments reflected in these non-GAAP measures are not intended to present all items that may have impacted these results.\n\nConsolidated Financial Information and Reconciliations\n\n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS****(unaudited)**_(In thousands, except for par value)_  \n---  \n**June

the second quarter of 2024. (2) Litigation costs include only those costs which are considered non-recurring and outside of the ordinary course of business based on the following considerations, which we assess regularly: (i) the frequency of similar cases that have been brought to date, or are expected to be brought within two years, (ii) the complexity of the case (e.g., complex class action litigation), (iii) the nature of the remedy(ies) sought, including the size of any monetary damages sought, (iv) the counterparty involved, and (v) our overall litigation strategy. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, litigation costs included cash expenses related to three distinct litigation matters, including (x) a securities class action litigation, (y) a privacy class action litigation and (z) a compensation model class action litigation.(3) Strategic initiatives consist of expenses directly related to a multi-phase system upgrade in connection with our recent and significant expansion. During each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we continued a process of evaluating and adopting critical enterprise-wide systems for (i) human resources management, (ii) clinician credentialing and onboarding process, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, (iii) a scalable electronic health resources system. Strategic initiatives represents costs, such as third-party consulting costs and one-time costs, that are not part of our ongoing operations related to these enterprise-wide systems. We considered the frequency and scale of this multi-part enterprise upgrade when determining that the expenses were not normal, recurring operating expenses.(4) Real estate optimization and restructuring charges consist of cash expenses and non-cash charges related to our real estate optimization initiative, which include certain asset impairment and disposal costs, certain gains and losses related to early lease terminations, and exit and disposal costs related to our real estate optimization initiative to consolidate our physical footprint during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. As the decision to close these centers was part of a significant strategic project driven by a historic shift in behavior, the magnitude of center closures has been and is expected to be greater than what would be expected as part of ordinary business operations and do not constitute normal recurring operating activities. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, real estate optimization and restructuring charges consisted of certain gains and losses related to early lease terminations of previously abandoned real estate leases in 2023.(5) Represents amortization of capitalized implementation costs related to cloud-based software arrangements that are included within general and administrative expenses included in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.(6) Primarily includes costs incurred to consummate or integrate acquired centers, certain of which are wholly-owned and certain of which are supported practices, in addition to the compensation paid to former owners of acquired centers and related expenses that are not reflective of the ongoing operating expenses of our centers. Acquired center integration and other are components of general and administrative expenses included in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Former owner fees is a component of center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization included in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/Y2FiMzdhNjItN2ViZi00YjFkLTk4NmMtZjgwMWE5NTcwNTYxLTEyMjAzOTY=/tiny/LifeStance-Health-Inc-.png)\n\nInvestor Relations Contact Monica Prokocki VP of Finance & Investor Relations 602-767-2100 investor.relations@lifestance.com\n\n### IR Tools\n\n  * [ Print Page  ]()\n  * [ RSS Feeds  ](/rss-feeds)\n  * [ Investor Events  ](/news-and-events/events-and-presentations)\n  * [ SEC Filings  ](/financial-information/sec-filings)\n  * [ Investor Alerts  ](/investor-alerts)\n  * [ Investor Contacts  ](/investor-contacts)\n\n\n"
