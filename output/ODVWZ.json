These forward-looking statements, by their nature, require Osisko Development Corp. (\"Osisko Development\", the \"Company\" or \"ODV\") to make certain assumptions and\nnecessarily involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Words such as\n\"may\", \"will\", \"would\", \"could\", \"expect\", \"believe\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"continue\", or the negative or comparable terminology, as well as terms usually used in the future and the conditional, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nInformation contained in forward-looking statements is based upon certain material assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including the assumptions, qualifications and limitations relating to the significance of the\nhigh-priority target drilling; the utility of modern exploration techniques; the potential for parallel high-grade gold fissure zones; the potential of Tintic to host a copper-gold porphyry center; the significance of regional exploration potential; the ability of the Company\nto complete the OFS and the scope, results and timing of thereof; progress in respect of pre-construction activities at Cariboo; the potential for unknown mineralized structures to extend existing zones of mineralization; category conversion; the timing and status of\npermitting; the results of ongoing stakeholder engagement; the capital resources available to Osisko Development; the ability of the Company to execute its planned activities, including as a result of its ability to seek additional funding or to reduce planned\nexpenditures; the ability of the Company to obtain future financing and the terms of such financing; management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments; the utility and significance of historic data, including the\nsignificance of the district hosting past producing mines; future mining activities; the potential of high grade gold mineralization on Trixie and Cariboo; the results (if any) of further exploration work to define and expand mineral resources; the ability of exploration\nwork (including drilling) to accurately predict mineralization; the ability to generate additional drill targets; the ability of management to understand the geology and potential of the Company's properties; the ability of the Company to expand mineral resources beyond\ncurrent mineral resource estimates; the timing and ability of the Company to complete upgrades to the mining and mill infrastructure at Trixie (if at all); continuation of test mining activities at Trixie (if at all); the timing and ability of the Company to ramp up\nprocessing capacity at Trixie (if at all); the ability of the Company to complete its exploration and development objectives for its projects in the timing contemplated and within expected costs (if at all); the ongoing advancement of the deposits on the Company's\nproperties; the deposit remaining open for expansion at depth and down plunge; the ability to realize upon any mineralization in a manner that is economic; the Cariboo project design and ability and timing to complete infrastructure at Cariboo (if at all); the ability and\ntiming for Cariboo to reach commercial production (if at all); the ability to adapt to changes in gold prices, estimates of costs, estimates of planned exploration and development expenditures; the ability of the Company to obtain further capital on reasonable terms;\nthe profitability (if at all) of the Company's operations; the Company being a well-positioned gold development company in Canada, USA and Mexico; the ability and timing for the permitting at San Antonio; the impact of permitting delays at San Antonio; the outcome\nof the strategic review of the San Antonio Project; sustainability and environmental impacts of operations at the Company's properties; the ability and timing of the Company to mutually agree with Condire to a board nominee or observer and impact of same; as well\nas other considerations that are believed to be appropriate in the circumstances, and any other information herein that is not a historical fact may be \"forward looking information\".\nMaterial assumptions also include, management's perceptions of historical trends, the ability of exploration (including drilling and chip sampling assays, and face sampling) to accurately predict mineralization, budget constraints and access to capital on terms\nacceptable to the Company, current conditions and expected future developments, regulatory framework remaining defined and understood, results of further exploration work to define or expand any mineral resources, as well as other considerations that are believed\nto be appropriate in the circumstances. Osisko Development considers its assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available, but cautions the reader that their assumptions regarding future events, many of which are beyond the control of Osisko\nDevelopment, may ultimately prove to be incorrect since they are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect Osisko Development and its business. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks relating to capital market conditions and the Company's\nability to access capital on terms acceptable to the Company for the contemplated exploration and development at the Company's properties; the ability to continue current operations and exploration; regulatory framework and presence of laws and regulations that\nmay impose restrictions on mining; the ability of exploration activities (including drill results and chip sampling, and face sampling results) to accurately predict mineralization; errors in management's geological modelling; the ability to expand operations or complete\nfurther exploration activities; the timing and ability of the Company to obtain required approvals and permits; the results of exploration activities; risks relating to exploration, development and mining activities; the global economic climate; metal and commodity\nprices; fluctuations in the currency markets; dilution; environmental risks; and community, non-governmental and governmental actions and the impact of stakeholder actions Osisko Development is confident a robust consultation process was followed in relation to its\nreceived BC Mines Act permits for the Cariboo Gold Project and continues to actively consult and engage with Indigenous nations and stakeholders. While any party may seek to have the decision related to the BC Mines Act permits reviewed by the courts, the\nCompany does not expect that such a review will impact its ability to proceed with the construction and operation of the Cariboo Gold Project in accordance with the approved BC Mines Act permits. .\nReaders are urged to consult the disclosure provided under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as the financial statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have\nbeen filed on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under Osisko Development's issuer profile and on the SEC's EDGAR website (www.sec.gov), for further information regarding the risks and other factors facing the Company, its business and operations. Although the\nCompany's believes the expectations conveyed by the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available as of the date hereof, no assurances can be given as to future results, levels of activity and achievements. The Company disclaims any\nobligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and there can be no assurance that these\nforward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nThis Presentation does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction. No securities may be offered or sold in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be\nunlawful prior to registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom or qualification under the securities laws of such other jurisdiction or an exemption therefrom.\nUnless otherwise noted, this Presentation has been prepared based on information available as of November 22, 2024. All currency references are to Canadian dollars, unless specified otherwise.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nODV used in this Presentation, certain non-IFRS measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" or \"AISC“ and “total cash cost”. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative, exploration, other expenses\nand sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS measure reported by ODV on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODV NYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023, and suspended once again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining recommences at Trixie, there is no guarantee that\nproduction will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to\nachieve the anticipated production costs may have a material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing operations at Trixie after closing, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility\nstudy, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the technical report entitled \"Technical Report on the Burgin Extension Deposit – Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment, Burgin Project, East Tintic Mining District, Utah County, Utah, USA\" dated December 2, 2011 (effective date November 17, 2011) which was prepared for Andover Ventures Inc. and Chief Consolidated Mining Co. by Paul G. Tietz, C.P.G., Neil\nPrenn, PE, Jeffery Wood, PE and Thomas Gast which had been prepared in compliance with NI 43-101 at the time it was published (the \"2011 PEA\"). The Burgin historical estimates are qualified entirely by the assumptions, qualifications and parameters outlined in\nthe full text of the 2011 PEA, a copy of which is accessible on SEDAR+ under Andover Mining Corp.'s issuer profile. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource continues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further\nexploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify the historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic\nresources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Words such as\n\"may\", \"will\", \"would\", \"could\", \"expect\", \"believe\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"continue\", or the negative or comparable terminology, as well as terms usually used in the future and the conditional, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nInformation contained in forward-looking statements is based upon certain material assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including the assumptions, qualifications and limitations relating to the significance of the\nhigh-priority target drilling; the utility of modern exploration techniques; the potential for parallel high-grade gold fissure zones; the potential of Tintic to host a copper-gold porphyry center; the significance of regional exploration potential; the results of the 2024\nTrixie MRE; the potential for unknown mineralized structures to extend existing zones of mineralization; category conversion; the timing and status of permitting; the capital resources available to Osisko Development; the ability of the Company to execute its planned\nactivities, including as a result of its ability to seek additional funding or to reduce planned expenditures; the ability of the Company to obtain future financing and the terms of such financing; management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions and\nexpected future developments; the utility and significance of historic data, including the significance of the district hosting past producing mines; future mining activities; the potential of high grade gold mineralization on Trixie and Cariboo; the results (if any) of further\nexploration work to define and expand mineral resources; the ability of exploration work (including drilling) to accurately predict mineralization; the ability to generate additional drill targets; the ability of management to understand the geology and potential of the\nCompany's properties; the ability of the Company to expand mineral resources beyond current mineral resource estimates; the timing and ability of the Company to complete upgrades to the mining and mill infrastructure at Trixie (if at all); continuation of test mining\nactivities at Trixie (if at all); the timing and ability of the Company to ramp up processing capacity at Trixie (if at all); the ability of the Company to complete its exploration and development objectives for its projects in 2024 in the timing contemplated and within\nexpected costs (if at all); the ongoing advancement of the deposits on the Company's properties; the deposit remaining open for expansion at depth and down plunge; the ability to realize upon any mineralization in a manner that is economic; the Cariboo project\ndesign and ability and timing to complete infrastructure at Cariboo (if at all); the ability and timing for Cariboo to reach commercial production (if at all); the ability to adapt to changes in gold prices, estimates of costs, estimates of planned exploration and\ndevelopment expenditures; the ability of the Company to obtain further capital on reasonable terms; the profitability (if at all) of the Company's operations; the Company being a well-positioned gold development company in Canada, USA and Mexico; the ability and\ntiming for the permitting at San Antonio; the impact of permitting delays at San Antonio; the outcome of the strategic review of the San Antonio Project; sustainability and environmental impacts of operations at the Company's properties; as well as other\nconsiderations that are believed to be appropriate in the circumstances, and any other information herein that is not a historical fact may be \"forward looking information\". Material assumptions also include, management's perceptions of historical trends, the ability of\nexploration (including drilling and chip sampling assays, and face sampling) to accurately predict mineralization, budget constraints and access to capital on terms acceptable to the Company, current conditions and expected future developments, regulatory framework\nremaining defined and understood, results of further exploration work to define or expand any mineral resources, as well as other considerations that are believed to be appropriate in the circumstances.\nOsisko Development considers its assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available, but cautions the reader that their assumptions regarding future events, many of which are beyond the control of Osisko Development, may ultimately prove to be\nincorrect since they are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect Osisko Development and its business. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks relating to capital market conditions and the Company's ability to access capital on terms acceptable to\nthe Company for the contemplated exploration and development at the Company's properties; the ability to continue current operations and exploration; regulatory framework and presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining; the ability of\nexploration activities (including drill results and chip sampling, and face sampling results) to accurately predict mineralization; errors in management's geological modelling; the ability to expand operations or complete further exploration activities; the timing and\nability of the Company to obtain required approvals and permits; the results of exploration activities; risks relating to exploration, development and mining activities; the global economic climate; metal and commodity prices; fluctuations in the currency markets;\ndilution; environmental risks; and community, non-governmental and governmental actions and the impact of stakeholder actions.\nReaders are urged to consult the disclosure provided under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as the financial statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have\nbeen filed on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under Osisko Development's issuer profile and on the SEC's EDGAR website (www.sec.gov), for further information regarding the risks and other factors facing the Company, its business and operations.

All currency references are to Canadian dollars, unless specified otherwise.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nODV used in this Presentation, certain non-IFRS measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" or \"AISC“ and “total cash cost”. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative, exploration, other expenses\nand sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS measure reported by ODV on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODV NYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023, and suspended once again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining recommences at Trixie, there is no guarantee that\nproduction will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to\nachieve the anticipated production costs may have a material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing operations at Trixie after closing, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility\nstudy, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the technical report entitled \"Technical Report on the Burgin Extension Deposit – Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment, Burgin Project, East Tintic Mining District, Utah County, Utah, USA\" dated December 2, 2011 (effective date November 17, 2011) which was prepared for Andover Ventures Inc. and Chief Consolidated Mining Co. by Paul G. Tietz, C.P.G., Neil\nPrenn, PE, Jeffery Wood, PE and Thomas Gast which had been prepared in compliance with NI 43-101 at the time it was published (the \"2011 PEA\"). The Burgin historical estimates are qualified entirely by the assumptions, qualifications and parameters outlined in\nthe full text of the 2011 PEA, a copy of which is accessible on SEDAR+ under Andover Mining Corp.'s issuer profile. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource continues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further\nexploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify the historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic\nresources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc. (the \"Cariboo FS\").

Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODV NYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023, and suspended once again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining recommences at Trixie, there is no guarantee that\nproduction will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to\nachieve the anticipated production costs may have a material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing operations at Trixie after closing, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility\nstudy, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the technical report entitled \"Technical Report on the Burgin Extension Deposit – Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment, Burgin Project, East Tintic Mining District, Utah County, Utah, USA\" dated December 2, 2011 (effective date November 17, 2011) which was prepared for Andover Ventures Inc. and Chief Consolidated Mining Co. by Paul G. Tietz, C.P.G., Neil\nPrenn, PE, Jeffery Wood, PE and Thomas Gast which had been prepared in compliance with NI 43-101 at the time it was published (the \"2011 PEA\"). The Burgin historical estimates are qualified entirely by the assumptions, qualifications and parameters outlined in\nthe full text of the 2011 PEA, a copy of which is accessible on SEDAR+ under Andover Mining Corp.'s issuer profile. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource continues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further\nexploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify the historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic\nresources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Words such as\n\"may\", \"will\", \"would\", \"could\", \"expect\", \"believe\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"continue\", or the negative or comparable terminology, as well as terms usually used in the future and the conditional, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nInformation contained in forward-looking statements is based upon certain material assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including the assumptions, qualifications and limitations relating to the significance of the\nhigh-priority target drilling; the utility of modern exploration techniques; the potential for parallel high-grade gold fissure zones; the potential of Tintic to host a copper-gold porphyry center; the significance of regional exploration potential; the results of the 2024\nTrixie MRE; the potential for unknown mineralized structures to extend existing zones of mineralization; category conversion; the timing and status of permitting; the Company's ability to prepare and file a technical report in respect of the 2024 Trixie MRE within 45\ndays from March 15, 2024; the capital resources available to Osisko Development; the ability of the Company to execute its planned activities, including as a result of its ability to seek additional funding or to reduce planned expenditures; the ability of the Company to\nobtain future financing and the terms of such financing; management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments; the utility and significance of historic data, including the significance of the district hosting past producing\nmines; future mining activities; the potential of high grade gold mineralization on Trixie and Cariboo; the results (if any) of further exploration work to define and expand mineral resources; the ability of exploration work (including drilling) to accurately predict\nmineralization; the ability to generate additional drill targets; the ability of management to understand the geology and potential of the Company's properties; the ability of the Company to expand mineral resources beyond current mineral resource estimates; the\ntiming and ability of the Company to complete upgrades to the mining and mill infrastructure at Trixie (if at all); continuation of test mining activities at Trixie (if at all); the timing and ability of the Company to ramp up processing capacity at Trixie (if at all); the ability\nof the Company to complete its exploration and development objectives for its projects in 2024 in the timing contemplated and within expected costs (if at all); the ongoing advancement of the deposits on the Company's properties; the deposit remaining open for\nexpansion at depth and down plunge; the ability to realize upon any mineralization in a manner that is economic; the Cariboo project design and ability and timing to complete infrastructure at Cariboo (if at all); the ability and timing for Cariboo to reach commercial\nproduction (if at all); the ability to adapt to changes in gold prices, estimates of costs, estimates of planned exploration and development expenditures; the ability of the Company to obtain further capital on reasonable terms; the profitability (if at all) of the Company's\noperations; the Company being a well-positioned gold development company in Canada, USA and Mexico; the ability and timing for the permitting at San Antonio; the impact of permitting delays at San Antonio; the outcome of the strategic review of the San Antonio\nProject; sustainability and environmental impacts of operations at the Company's properties; as well as other considerations that are believed to be appropriate in the circumstances, and any other information herein that is not a historical fact may be \"forward looking\ninformation\". Material assumptions also include, management's perceptions of historical trends, the ability of exploration (including drilling and chip sampling assays, and face sampling) to accurately predict mineralization, budget constraints and access to capital on\nterms acceptable to the Company, current conditions and expected future developments, regulatory framework remaining defined and understood, results of further exploration work to define or expand any mineral resources, as well as other considerations that are\nbelieved to be appropriate in the circumstances.\nOsisko Development considers its assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available, but cautions the reader that their assumptions regarding future events, many of which are beyond the control of Osisko Development, may ultimately prove to be\nincorrect since they are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect Osisko Development and its business. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks relating to capital market conditions and the Company's ability to access capital on terms acceptable to\nthe Company for the contemplated exploration and development at the Company's properties; the ability to continue current operations and exploration; regulatory framework and presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining; the ability of\nexploration activities (including drill results and chip sampling, and face sampling results) to accurately predict mineralization; errors in management's geological modelling; the ability to expand operations or complete further exploration activities; the timing and\nability of the Company to obtain required approvals and permits; the results of exploration activities; risks relating to exploration, development and mining activities; the global economic climate; metal and commodity prices; fluctuations in the currency markets;\ndilution; environmental risks; and community, non-governmental and governmental actions and the impact of stakeholder actions.\nReaders are urged to consult the disclosure provided under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as the financial statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have\nbeen filed on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under Osisko Development's issuer profile and on the SEC's EDGAR website (www.sec.gov), for further information regarding the risks and other factors facing the Company, its business and operations. Although the\nCompany's believes the expectations conveyed by the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available as of the date hereof, no assurances can be given as to future results, levels of activity and achievements. The Company disclaims any\nobligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and there can be no assurance that these\nforward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nThis Presentation does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction. No securities may be offered or sold in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be\nunlawful prior to registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom or qualification under the securities laws of such other jurisdiction or an exemption therefrom.\nUnless otherwise noted, this Presentation has been prepared based on information available as of June 26, 2024. All currency references are to Canadian dollars, unless specified otherwise.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nODV used in this Presentation, certain non-IFRS measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" or \"AISC“ and “total cash cost”. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative, exploration, other expenses\nand sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS measure reported by ODV on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODV NYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023, and suspended once again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining recommences at Trixie, there is no guarantee that\nproduction will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to\nachieve the anticipated production costs may have a material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing operations at Trixie after closing, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility\nstudy, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the technical report entitled \"Technical Report on the Burgin Extension Deposit – Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment, Burgin Project, East Tintic Mining District, Utah County, Utah, USA\" dated December 2, 2011 (effective date November 17, 2011) which was prepared for Andover Ventures Inc. and Chief Consolidated Mining Co. by Paul G. Tietz, C.P.G., Neil\nPrenn, PE, Jeffery Wood, PE and Thomas Gast which had been prepared in compliance with NI 43-101 at the time it was published (the \"2011 PEA\"). The Burgin historical estimates are qualified entirely by the assumptions, qualifications and parameters outlined in\nthe full text of the 2011 PEA, a copy of which is accessible on SEDAR+ under Andover Mining Corp.'s issuer profile. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource continues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further\nexploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify the historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic\nresources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc.

All currency references are to Canadian dollars, unless specified otherwise.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nODV used in this Presentation, certain non-IFRS measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" or \"AISC“ and “total cash cost”. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative, exploration, other expenses\nand sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS measure reported by ODV on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODV NYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023, and suspended once again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining recommences at Trixie, there is no guarantee that\nproduction will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to\nachieve the anticipated production costs may have a material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing operations at Trixie after closing, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility\nstudy, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the technical report entitled \"Technical Report on the Burgin Extension Deposit – Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment, Burgin Project, East Tintic Mining District, Utah County, Utah, USA\" dated December 2, 2011 (effective date November 17, 2011) which was prepared for Andover Ventures Inc. and Chief Consolidated Mining Co. by Paul G. Tietz, C.P.G., Neil\nPrenn, PE, Jeffery Wood, PE and Thomas Gast which had been prepared in compliance with NI 43-101 at the time it was published (the \"2011 PEA\"). The Burgin historical estimates are qualified entirely by the assumptions, qualifications and parameters outlined in\nthe full text of the 2011 PEA, a copy of which is accessible on SEDAR+ under Andover Mining Corp.'s issuer profile. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource continues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further\nexploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify the historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic\nresources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc.

All currency references are to Canadian dollars, unless specified otherwise.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nODV used in this Presentation, certain non-IFRS measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" or \"AISC“ and “total cash cost”. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative, exploration, other expenses\nand sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS measure reported by ODV on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODV NYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023, and suspended once again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining recommences at Trixie, there is no guarantee that\nproduction will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to\nachieve the anticipated production costs may have a material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing operations at Trixie after closing, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility\nstudy, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the technical report entitled \"Technical Report on the Burgin Extension Deposit – Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment, Burgin Project, East Tintic Mining District, Utah County, Utah, USA\" dated December 2, 2011 (effective date November 17, 2011) which was prepared for Andover Ventures Inc. and Chief Consolidated Mining Co. by Paul G. Tietz, C.P.G., Neil\nPrenn, PE, Jeffery Wood, PE and Thomas Gast which had been prepared in compliance with NI 43-101 at the time it was published (the \"2011 PEA\"). The Burgin historical estimates are qualified entirely by the assumptions, qualifications and parameters outlined in\nthe full text of the 2011 PEA, a copy of which is accessible on SEDAR+ under Andover Mining Corp.'s issuer profile. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource continues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further\nexploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify the historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic\nresources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Words such as\n\"may\", \"will\", \"would\", \"could\", \"expect\", \"believe\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"continue\", or the negative or comparable terminology, as well as terms usually used in the future and the conditional, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nInformation contained in forward-looking statements is based upon certain material assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including the assumptions, qualifications and limitations relating to the significance of the\nhigh-priority target drilling; the utility of modern exploration techniques; the potential for parallel high-grade gold fissure zones; the potential of Tintic to host a copper-gold porphyry center; the significance of regional exploration potential; the results of the 2024\nTrixie MRE; the potential for unknown mineralized structures to extend existing zones of mineralization; category conversion; the timing and status of permitting; the Company's ability to prepare and file a technical report in respect of the 2024 Trixie MRE within 45\ndays from March 15, 2024; the capital resources available to Osisko Development; the ability of the Company to execute its planned activities, including as a result of its ability to seek additional funding or to reduce planned expenditures; the ability of the Company to\nobtain future financing and the terms of such financing; management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments; the utility and significance of historic data, including the significance of the district hosting past producing\nmines; future mining activities; the potential of high grade gold mineralization on Trixie and Cariboo; the results (if any) of further exploration work to define and expand mineral resources; the ability of exploration work (including drilling) to accurately predict\nmineralization; the ability to generate additional drill targets; the ability of management to understand the geology and potential of the Company's properties; the ability of the Company to expand mineral resources beyond current mineral resource estimates; the\ntiming and ability of the Company to complete upgrades to the mining and mill infrastructure at Trixie (if at all); continuation of test mining activities at Trixie (if at all); the timing and ability of the Company to ramp up processing capacity at Trixie (if at all); the ability\nof the Company to complete its exploration and development objectives for its projects in 2024 in the timing contemplated and within expected costs (if at all); the ongoing advancement of the deposits on the Company's properties; the deposit remaining open for\nexpansion at depth and down plunge; the ability to realize upon any mineralization in a manner that is economic; the Cariboo project design and ability and timing to complete infrastructure at Cariboo (if at all); the ability and timing for Cariboo to reach commercial\nproduction (if at all); the ability to adapt to changes in gold prices, estimates of costs, estimates of planned exploration and development expenditures; the ability of the Company to obtain further capital on reasonable terms; the profitability (if at all) of the Company's\noperations; the Company being a well-positioned gold development company in Canada, USA and Mexico; the ability and timing for the permitting at San Antonio; the impact of permitting delays at San Antonio; the outcome of the strategic review of the San Antonio\nProject; sustainability and environmental impacts of operations at the Company's properties; as well as other considerations that are believed to be appropriate in the circumstances, and any other information herein that is not a historical fact may be \"forward looking\ninformation\". Material assumptions also include, management's perceptions of historical trends, the ability of exploration (including drilling and chip sampling assays, and face sampling) to accurately predict mineralization, budget constraints and access to capital on\nterms acceptable to the Company, current conditions and expected future developments, regulatory framework remaining defined and understood, results of further exploration work to define or expand any mineral resources, as well as other considerations that are\nbelieved to be appropriate in the circumstances.\nOsisko Development considers its assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available, but cautions the reader that their assumptions regarding future events, many of which are beyond the control of Osisko Development, may ultimately prove to be\nincorrect since they are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect Osisko Development and its business. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks relating to capital market conditions and the Company's ability to access capital on terms acceptable to\nthe Company for the contemplated exploration and development at the Company's properties; the ability to continue current operations and exploration; regulatory framework and presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining; the ability of\nexploration activities (including drill results and chip sampling, and face sampling results) to accurately predict mineralization; errors in management's geological modelling; the ability to expand operations or complete further exploration activities; the timing and\nability of the Company to obtain required approvals and permits; the results of exploration activities; risks relating to exploration, development and mining activities; the global economic climate; metal and commodity prices; fluctuations in the currency markets;\ndilution; environmental risks; and community, non-governmental and governmental actions and the impact of stakeholder actions.\nReaders are urged to consult the disclosure provided under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as the financial statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have\nbeen filed on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under Osisko Development's issuer profile and on the SEC's EDGAR website (www.sec.gov), for further information regarding the risks and other factors facing the Company, its business and operations. Although the\nCompany's believes the expectations conveyed by the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available as of the date hereof, no assurances can be given as to future results, levels of activity and achievements. The Company disclaims any\nobligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and there can be no assurance that these\nforward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nThis Presentation does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction. No securities may be offered or sold in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be\nunlawful prior to registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom or qualification under the securities laws of such other jurisdiction or an exemption therefrom.\nUnless otherwise noted, this Presentation has been prepared based on information available as of March 31, 2024. All currency references are to Canadian dollars, unless specified otherwise.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nODV used in this Presentation, certain non-IFRS measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" or \"AISC“ and “total cash cost”. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative, exploration, other expenses\nand sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS measure reported by ODV on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODV NYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023, and suspended once again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining recommences at Trixie, there is no guarantee that\nproduction will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to\nachieve the anticipated production costs may have a material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing operations at Trixie after closing, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility\nstudy, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the technical report entitled \"Technical Report on the Burgin Extension Deposit – Preliminary\nEconomic Assessment, Burgin Project, East Tintic Mining District, Utah County, Utah, USA\" dated December 2, 2011 (effective date November 17, 2011) which was prepared for Andover Ventures Inc. and Chief Consolidated Mining Co. by Paul G. Tietz, C.P.G., Neil\nPrenn, PE, Jeffery Wood, PE and Thomas Gast which had been prepared in compliance with NI 43-101 at the time it was published (the \"2011 PEA\"). The Burgin historical estimates are qualified entirely by the assumptions, qualifications and parameters outlined in\nthe full text of the 2011 PEA, a copy of which is accessible on SEDAR+ under Andover Mining Corp.'s issuer profile. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource continues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further\nexploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify the historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic\nresources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements and are based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this Presentation. Any statement that involves discussions with respect to\npredictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions, future events or performance (often but not always using phrases such as \"expects\", or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", \"plans\", \"budget\",\n\"scheduled\", \"forecasts\", \"estimates\", \"believes\" or \"intends\" or variations of such words and phrases or stating that certain actions, events or results \"may\" or \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken to occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact and\nmay be forward-looking statements.\nIn this Presentation, forward-looking statements relate, among other things: the ability of Osisko Development Corp. (\"Osisko Development\", the \"Company\" or \"ODV\") to achieve the results in the Cariboo FS (as defined herein); the assumptions, qualifications and\nlimitations of the results of the Cariboo FS, including the economic results (NPV, IRR, FCF and AISC calculations) and the sensitivity analysis of the variables included therein; LOM estimates; production capacity and expectations; expected mining methods; Cariboo\nbeing a large-scale, cash producing, long-life and profitable gold mine (or any of those things); capital cost estimates; operating cost estimates; AISC gold prices and exchange rate assumptions; the assumptions, limitations and qualifications relating to the 2024 Trixie\nMRE (as defined herein); mining and mine design expectations; processing expectations; infrastructure assumptions; permitting, environmental and closure expectations (timing and if at all); steps required to obtain an EAC; cooperation of stakeholders, community\nand partners; royalties; any potential value enhancement opportunities; the benefits (if any) of the sorting facility on reducing processing costs, increasing gold recoveries and reducing waste materials; our ability to define grade continuity within the mineralized vein\ncorridors; future gold productions; the ability of exploration results (including drilling) to accurately predict mineralization; future mining activities; the ability of Osisko Development to identify mineral resources at our properties; the ability of Osisko Development to\nexpand mineral resources beyond current mineral resource estimates; the utility of the existing infrastructure at the Trixie test mine (\"Trixie\"); the utility of historic data in respect of Trixie; the ability to adapt to changes in gold prices; estimates of costs, estimates of\nplanned exploration and development expenditures; the ability of Osisko Development to obtain further capital on reasonable terms; the profitability of our mining operations; Osisko Development being well-positioned as a gold development company in Canada,\nU.S.A. and Mexico; indicative valuations; expected investor returns; mineral inventory; and estimates of gold prices. All forward-looking statements entail various risks and uncertainties that are based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially\nfrom those contained in such information.\nAlthough Osisko Development believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and are not guarantees of future\nperformance and actual results may accordingly differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. These uncertainties and risks relate, among other things, to: the Company's ability to achieve the results in the Cariboo FS; the realization of the assumptions,\nlimitations, qualifications and sensitivities in the Cariboo FS; the assumptions, limitations and qualifications relating to the 2024 Trixie MRE; the ability of exploration activities (including drill results) to accurately predict mineralization; the ability to realize upon\ngeological modelling; the ability of Osisko Development to complete further exploration activities, including drilling; property interests in the assets of Osisko Development; the ability of the results of exploration activities; risks relating to mining activities; fluctuations\nin spot and forward prices of gold, silver, base metals or certain other commodities; fluctuations in currency markets (such as the Canadian dollar to United States dollar exchange rate); change in international, national and local government, legislation, taxation,\ncontrols, regulations and political or economic developments; risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining (including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations pressures, cave-ins\nand flooding); inability to obtain adequate insurance to cover risks and hazards; the presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining; employee relations; relationships with and claims by local communities and indigenous populations;\navailability of increasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development (including the risks of obtaining necessary licenses, permits and approvals from government authorities); and title to properties.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance. Osisko Development cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements and investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty\ntherein.\nFor additional information with respect to these and other factors and assumptions underlying the forward‐looking statements made herein concerning Osisko Development, please refer to the public disclosure record of Osisko Development, including the restated\nannual information form of Osisko Development for the year ended December 31, 2022 as amended, and the most recent annual and interim financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis of Osisko Development, which are available on\nSEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development's issuer profile. The forward‐looking statements in this presentation reflect management's expectations as of the date of this news release and are subject to change after such date.\nOsisko Development disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.\nThis Presentation does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction. No securities may be offered or sold in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be\nunlawful prior to registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom or qualification under the securities laws of such other jurisdiction or an exemption therefrom.\nUnless otherwise noted, this Presentation has been prepared based on information available as of March 15, 2024. All currency references are to Canadian dollars, unless specified otherwise.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nODV used in this Presentation, certain non-IFRS measures including, “all-in sustaining cost” or \"AISC“ and “total cash cost”. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative, exploration, other expenses\nand sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS measure reported by ODV on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODVNYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022 and resumed in the second quarter of 2023. Even with the resumption of small scale test-mining at Trixie, there is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or at all or\nthat anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs may have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing current operations at Trixie, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the 2011 PEA is referenced herein. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource\ncontinues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further exploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify\nthe historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic resources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc.

All forward-looking statements entail various risks and uncertainties that are based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially\nfrom those contained in such information.\nAlthough Osisko Development believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and are not guarantees of future\nperformance and actual results may accordingly differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. These uncertainties and risks relate, among other things, to: the Company's ability to achieve the results in the Cariboo FS; the realization of the assumptions,\nlimitations, qualifications and sensitivities in the Cariboo FS; the assumptions, limitations and qualifications relating to the Trixie MRE; the ability of exploration activities (including drill results) to accurately predict mineralization; the ability to realize upon geological\nmodelling; the ability of Osisko Development to complete further exploration activities, including drilling; property interests in the assets of Osisko Development; the ability of the results of exploration activities; risks relating to mining activities; fluctuations in spot and\nforward prices of gold, silver, base metals or certain other commodities; fluctuations in currency markets (such as the Canadian dollar to United States dollar exchange rate); change in international, national and local government, legislation, taxation, controls,\nregulations and political or economic developments; risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining (including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations pressures, cave-ins and\nflooding); inability to obtain adequate insurance to cover risks and hazards; the presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining; employee relations; relationships with and claims by local communities and indigenous populations; availability of\nincreasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development (including the risks of obtaining necessary licenses, permits and approvals from government authorities); and title to properties. However, there\ncan be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future\nperformance. Osisko Development cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements and investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.\nFor additional information with respect to these and other factors and assumptions underlying the forward‐looking statements made herein concerning Osisko Development, please refer to the public disclosure record of Osisko Development, including the restated\nannual information form of Osisko Development for the year ended December 31, 2022 as amended, and the most recent annual and interim financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis of Osisko Development, which are available on\nSEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development's issuer profile. The forward‐looking statements in this presentation reflect management's expectations as of the date of this news release and are subject to change after such date.\nOsisko Development disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.\nThis Presentation does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction. No securities may be offered or sold in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be\nunlawful prior to registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom or qualification under the securities laws of such other jurisdiction or an exemption therefrom.\nUnless otherwise noted, this Presentation has been prepared based on information available as of February 8, 2024. All currency references are to Canadian dollars, unless specified otherwise.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nODV used in this Presentation, certain non-IFRS measures including, “all-in sustaining cost” or \"AISC“ and “total cash cost”. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative, exploration, other expenses\nand sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS measure reported by ODV on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODVNYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022 and resumed in the second quarter of 2023. Even with the resumption of small scale test-mining at Trixie, there is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or at all or\nthat anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs may have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing current operations at Trixie, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the 2011 PEA is referenced herein. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource\ncontinues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further exploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify\nthe historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic resources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements and are based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this Presentation. Any statement that involves discussions with respect to\npredictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions, future events or performance (often but not always using phrases such as \"expects\", or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", \"plans\", \"budget\",\n\"scheduled\", \"forecasts\", \"estimates\", \"believes\" or \"intends\" or variations of such words and phrases or stating that certain actions, events or results \"may\" or \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken to occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact and\nmay be forward-looking statements.\nIn this Presentation, forward-looking statements relate, among other things: the ability of Osisko Development Corp. (\"Osisko Development\", the \"Company\" or \"ODV\") to achieve the results in the Cariboo FS (as defined herein); the assumptions, qualifications and\nlimitations of the results of the Cariboo FS, including the economic results (NPV, IRR, FCF and AISC calculations) and the sensitivity analysis of the variables included therein; LOM estimates; production capacity and expectations; expected mining methods; Cariboo\nbeing a large-scale, cash producing, long-life and profitable gold mine (or any of those things); capital cost estimates; operating cost estimates; AISC gold prices and exchange rate assumptions; the assumptions, limitations and qualifications relating to the Trixie MRE\n(as defined herein); mining and mine design expectations; processing expectations; infrastructure assumptions; permitting, environmental and closure expectations (timing and if at all); steps required to obtain an EAC; cooperation of stakeholders, community and\npartners; royalties; any potential value enhancement opportunities; the benefits (if any) of the sorting facility on reducing processing costs, increasing gold recoveries and reducing waste materials; our ability to define grade continuity within the mineralized vein\ncorridors; future gold productions; the ability of exploration results (including drilling) to accurately predict mineralization; future mining activities; the ability of Osisko Development to identify mineral resources at our properties; the ability of Osisko Development to\nexpand mineral resources beyond current mineral resource estimates; the utility of the existing infrastructure at the Trixie test mine (\"Trixie\"); the utility of historic data in respect of Trixie; the ability to adapt to changes in gold prices; estimates of costs, estimates of\nplanned exploration and development expenditures; the ability of Osisko Development to obtain further capital on reasonable terms; the profitability of our mining operations; Osisko Development being well-positioned as a gold development company in Canada,\nU.S.A. and Mexico; indicative valuations; expected investor returns; mineral inventory; and estimates of gold prices. All forward-looking statements entail various risks and uncertainties that are based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially\nfrom those contained in such information.\nAlthough Osisko Development believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and are not guarantees of future\nperformance and actual results may accordingly differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. These uncertainties and risks relate, among other things, to: the Company's ability to achieve the results in the Cariboo FS; the realization of the assumptions,\nlimitations, qualifications and sensitivities in the Cariboo FS; the assumptions, limitations and qualifications relating to the Trixie MRE; the ability of exploration activities (including drill results) to accurately predict mineralization; the ability to realize upon geological\nmodelling; the ability of Osisko Development to complete further exploration activities, including drilling; property interests in the assets of Osisko Development; the ability of the results of exploration activities; risks relating to mining activities; fluctuations in spot and\nforward prices of gold, silver, base metals or certain other commodities; fluctuations in currency markets (such as the Canadian dollar to United States dollar exchange rate); change in international, national and local government, legislation, taxation, controls,\nregulations and political or economic developments; risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining (including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations pressures, cave-ins and\nflooding); inability to obtain adequate insurance to cover risks and hazards; the presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining; employee relations; relationships with and claims by local communities and indigenous populations; availability of\nincreasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development (including the risks of obtaining necessary licenses, permits and approvals from government authorities); and title to properties. However, there\ncan be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future\nperformance. Osisko Development cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements and investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.\nFor additional information with respect to these and other factors and assumptions underlying the forward‐looking statements made herein concerning Osisko Development, please refer to the public disclosure record of Osisko Development, including the restated\nannual information form of Osisko Development for the year ended December 31, 2022 as amended, and the most recent annual and interim financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis of Osisko Development, which are available on\nSEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development's issuer profile. The forward‐looking statements in this presentation reflect management's expectations as of the date of this news release and are subject to change after such date.\nOsisko Development disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.\nThis Presentation does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction. No securities may be offered or sold in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be\nunlawful prior to registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom or qualification under the securities laws of such other jurisdiction or an exemption therefrom.\nUnless otherwise noted, this Presentation has been prepared based on information available as of January 5, 2024. All currency references are to Canadian dollars, unless specified otherwise.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nODV used in this Presentation, certain non-IFRS measures including, “all-in sustaining cost” or \"AISC“ and “total cash cost”. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative, exploration, other expenses\nand sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS measure reported by ODV on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general and administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation,\nreclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs for the life of the mine. The Company believes that such measures provide investors with an alternative view to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation\nor as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. See the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the news release of the Company dated January 3, 2022 and the Cariboo FS (as defined herein), which are available on SEDAR+\n(www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development’s issuer profile, and on Osisko Development's corporate website (https://osiskodev.com/cariboo-gold-project/).\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS\nOsisko Development is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in accordance with\nCanadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") generally applicable to US companies. As such, the information included in this Presentation concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information made\npublic by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nODVNYSE TSXV\n2\nosiskodev.com\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nGradient CAUTION REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\nThis Presentation uses the terms measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral resources as a relative measure of the level of confidence in the resource estimate. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not economic mineral\nreserves and that the economic viability of mineral resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. Mineral resource estimates may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other\nrelevant issues. However, other than as disclosed in this Presentation, Osisko Development is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues that could materially affect the estimates of mineral\nresources disclosed herein. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to the category of indicated mineral resource or measured mineral resource. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the\nCanadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted in 2019 and incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form\nthe basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary economic assessment as defined under NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be\nmined economically.\nCAUTION REGARDING TEST MINING WITHOUT FEASIBILITY STUDY\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching at the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves, demonstrating\neconomic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and\ntechnical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022 and resumed in the second quarter of 2023. Even with the resumption of small scale test-mining at Trixie, there is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or at all or\nthat anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs may have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing current operations at Trixie, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability.\nBURGIN HISTORIC RESOURCE\nThe past producing Burgin mine, previously operated by Kennecott until 1978, has potential for a significant silver-lead-zinc-gold deposit. The historic resource as outlined in the 2011 PEA is referenced herein. Osisko Development believes that the historic resource\ncontinues to be relevant and reliable as an indication of the potential of the Burgin Mine. Further exploration work including drilling will be required to upgrade the historic resource to current. Osisko Development cautions sufficient work has not been done to classify\nthe historic resources as a current resource and Osisko Development is not treating the historic resources as a current resource.\nSCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information in this Presentation relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by a technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report – Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project” and dated January 12, 2023 (with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022), which was prepared for Osisko Development by BBA Engineering Ltd. with contributions from several independent consulting firms, including Falkirk Environmental Consultants Ltd., Golder Associates Ltd, InnovExplo Inc., JDS Energy and\nMining Inc., KCC Geoconsulting Inc., Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., and WSP USA Inc.

Mr. Page attended the only Governance\nand Nomination Committee meeting held during the time he was a member thereof in the financial year ended December 31, 2023.\n(2) Mr. Tremblay is not standing for re-election in 2024. It is the intention of the Board to appoint a replacement member of the Environmental and Sustainability Committee following\nthe Meeting.\n(3) Mr. Danziger was appointed as Mr. Page’s replacement to the Governance and Nomination Committee as of May 8, 2023. Mr. Danziger attended 100% of the Governance\nand Nomination Committee meeting held during the time he was a member thereof.\nMajority Voting Policy\nThe Board has adopted a Majority Voting Policy (the “Majority Voting Policy”) providing that, in an\nuncontested election of directors, if the number of votes cast in favour of a nominee director does not\nrepresent a majority of the votes cast “for” or “against” him or her, the nominee will not be elected as a\ndirector.\nThe Majority Voting Policy provides that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if a nominee for election as director\nin an uncontested election is an incumbent director that does not receive the vote of at least the majority of\nthe votes cast “for” or “against” him or her, the director may continue in office until the earlier of (i) the 90th\nday after the election, or (ii) the day on which his or her successor is appointed or elected.\nIn accordance with the provisions of the CBCA and its regulations, the Board may appoint a director even\nif he or she does not receive majority support as required by the Majority Voting Policy in the event that\nsuch appointment is necessary to satisfy Canadian residency requirements, or the requirement that at least\ntwo (2) directors are not also officers or employees of the Corporation or its affiliates.\nThe full text of the Majority Voting Policy can be found on the Corporation’s website at\nhttps://osiskodev.com/about/#governance.\nDirector Independence\nIn determining whether a director is an independent director, the Board applies the standards developed\nby the CSA. A director is not independent if such director has a direct or indirect relationship that the Board\nbelieves could reasonably be expected to interfere with the ability to exercise independent judgment.\nThe Board of the Corporation for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 was comprised of a majority of\nindependent directors, namely: Misses McCarthy and Katusa and Messrs. Middlemiss, Page and Danziger.\nMr. Tremblay, who is not standing for re-election at this Meeting, occupied the role of interim Chief\nOperating Officer of the Corporation since December 31, 2023 and does not meet the independence\nstandards as an executive officer of the Corporation. Mr. Roosen, Chair of the Board and Chief Executive\nOfficer of the Corporation also does not meet the independence standards as an executive officer of the\nCorporation and, as such, the Board has a Lead Director to assist in providing independent leadership for\nthe Board, namely in discharging its duties, responsibilities and obligations independently of Management.\nAn in camera session is included in the agenda of every Board and Board Committee meeting and the\nindependent directors have the prerogative to hold such private session or not at their discretion. At the\nrequest of the independent directors, attendance of certain members of Management of the Corporation\nmay be required from time to time. In the financial year ended December 31, 2023, the independent\ndirectors regularly convened and held in camera sessions, without members of Management in attendance,\nafter both ad hoc and regularly scheduled meetings.\nAs of the date of this Circular, five (5) of the Corporation’s six (6) nominee directors are independent. The\nCorporation does not have an executive committee of its Board.\nInterlocking Directorships\nAs of the date of the Circular, there are no interlocks of the director nominees. The Corporation considers\nthere to be an interlocking relationship among directors where a director sits on the same board as another\ndirector or executive officer of the Corporation. The Corporation also evaluates interlocking relationships\nwith close family members of executives or within group companies to assess the potential for a conflict of\ninterest.\nAs part of the Board Tenure Policy (as defined and further described below), directors are expected to\ninform the Chair of the Board or the Lead Director as to all boards of directors that they sit on or that they\nhave been asked to join so as to allow the Board to determine whether it is appropriate for such director to\ncontinue to serve as a member of the Corporation’s Board or Board Committee.\nCorporate Cease Trade Orders\nExcept as disclosed in this section, as at the date of this Circular and based upon information provided to\nit by the proposed directors, no proposed director is or has been within 10 years before the date of this\nCircular, a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer of any company (including the\nCorporation) that:\na) was subject to a cease trade order, an order similar to a cease trade order, or an order that denied\nthe relevant company access to any exemption under applicable securities legislation, and which\nin all cases was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days (an “Order”), which Order\nwas issued while the proposed director was acting in the capacity as director, chief executive officer\nor chief financial officer of such company; or\nb) was subject to an Order that was issued after the proposed director ceased to be a director, chief\nexecutive officer or chief financial officer and which resulted from an event that occurred while that\nperson was acting in the capacity as director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer of such\ncompany.\nOn April 16, 2014, the Ontario Securities Commission issued a permanent management cease trade order,\nwhich superseded a temporary management cease trade order dated April 4, 2014, against the Interim\nChief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Carpathian Gold Inc. (“Carpathian”). The\npermanent management cease trade order was issued in connection with Carpathian’s failure to file its (i)\naudited annual financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2013, (ii) management’s discussion\nand analysis relating to the audited annual financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2013,\nand (iii) corresponding certifications of the foregoing filings as required by National Instrument 52-109 –\n2024 Management Information Circular 16\nCertification of Disclosure in the Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings. The management cease trade order\nwas lifted on June 19, 2014 following the filing of the required continuous disclosure documents on June\n17, 2014. During the period of the management cease trade order, Mr. Danziger was a director of\nCarpathian.\nBankruptcies, or Penalties or Sanctions\nExcept as disclosed in this section, as at the date of this Circular and based upon information provided to\nit by the proposed directors, no proposed director:\na) is, as at the date of this Circular, or has been within ten (10) years before the date of this Circular,\na director or executive officer of any company (including the Corporation) that, while that person\nwas acting in that capacity, or within a year of that person ceasing to act in that capacity, became\nbankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency or was subject\nto or instituted any proceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors or had a receiver,\nreceiver manager or trustee appointed to hold its assets;\nb) has, within ten (10) years before the date of this Circular, become bankrupt, made a proposal under\nany legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency or become subject to or instituted any\nproceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors or had a receiver, receiver manager or\ntrustee appointed to hold his assets;\nc) has been subject to any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court relating to securities legislation\nor by a securities regulatory authority or has entered into a settlement agreement with a securities\nregulatory authority; or\nd) has been subject to any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body that would\nlikely be considered important to a reasonable securityholder in deciding whether to vote for a\nproposed director.\nMr. Danziger was appointed director of American Apparel, Inc. (“American Apparel”), a company listed on\nthe NYSE MKT LLC exchange, on July 11, 2011 and resigned as director on June 14, 2015. Subsequently,\non October 5, 2015, American Apparel announced that it had reached an agreement with its lenders to\nsignificantly reduce its debt and interest payments through a consensual pre-arranged reorganization under\nChapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In\nJanuary 2016, American Apparel delisted and was privatized under the Chapter 11 filing.\n2.3 Appointment of Auditor\nThe Board and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Corporation recommend that Shareholders vote for\nthe appointment of PwC, a partnership of chartered professional accountants, as independent auditor of\nthe Corporation for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 and to authorize the directors to establish its\nremuneration.

To be adopted, the resolution\nrequires the approval of a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting.\n2024 Management Information Circular 17\n2.4 Approval of the Corporation’s Amended Stock Option Plan.\nThe Corporation first adopted, and the Shareholders approved, a stock option plan for officers, directors,\nemployees and consultants of the Corporation on November 20, 2020 in connection with the RTO\nTransaction, which was amended and restated on March 21, 2023 (the “Amended SOP”).

If an Option expires or\notherwise terminates for any reason, the Common Shares reserved for issuance in respect of such Option\nwill again be available for issuance under the Amended SOP.

Good corporate governance is essential\nto retaining the trust of our Shareholders, attracting the right people to the organization and maintaining our\nsocial license in the communities where we work and operate. The Corporation also believes that good\ngovernance enhances its performance.\nThe Corporation’s governance framework is evolving as the Corporation continues to grow. Its governance\npolicies respect the rights of Shareholders and comply with the rules of the CSA and the Exchange. The\nBoard believes that constructive engagement with Shareholders is important for good corporate\ngovernance and transparency, and welcomes shareholder inquiries and comments. Shareholders,\nemployees and other interested parties may communicate directly with the Chair of the Board by e-mailing\nchair@osiskodev.com.\nThe Board has adopted Board and Board Committee charters as well as other appropriate policies and\npractices. Those policies include:\n• Code of Ethics • Policy Regarding Tenure on the Board of\nDirectors\n• Majority Voting Policy • Environmental Policy\n• Disclosure Policy • Health and Safety Policy\n• Internal Whistle Blowing Policy • Clawback Policy\n• Policy Regarding Diversity in Corporate • Securities Trading Policy\nTalent\n• Policy Regarding the Diversity of the Board • Directors and Officers Investment Policy\nof Directors\n• Policy on the Prevention of Psychological • Protection of Privacy Policy\nor Sexual Harassment in the Workplace\nand the Handling of Complaints\nA copy of the Corporation’s Board and Board Committee charters as well as the policies listed above are\nposted on the Corporation’s website at https://osiskodev.com/about/#governance and can be requested via\nemail at info@osiskodev.com.\nThe following discussion outlines some of the Corporation’s current corporate governance practices,\nparticularly with respect to the matters addressed by Policy Statement 58-201 to Corporate Governance\nGuidelines and Regulation 58-101 adopted by the CSA.\n3.2 Code of Ethics\nThe Board has adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to all of its directors, officers and employees, including\nthe Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, the Lead Director, the President, the Chief Financial\nOfficer and Vice President, Finance and other persons performing financial reporting functions.\nThe Code of Ethics communicates to directors, officers and employees standards for business conduct in\nthe use of the Corporation’s time, resources and assets, and identifies and clarifies proper conduct in areas\n2024 Management Information Circular 21\nof potential conflict of interest. Each director, officer and employee is provided with a copy of the Code of\nEthics upon beginning their position and is asked to sign an acknowledgement that the standards and\nprinciples of the Code of Ethics will be maintained at all times. Directors, officers and designated employees\nare required, on an annual basis, to re-declare their commitment to abide by the Corporation’s Code of\nEthics.\nThe Code of Ethics is designed to deter wrongdoing and promote: (a) honest and ethical conduct; (b)\ncompliance with laws, rules and regulations; (c) prompt internal reporting of Code of Ethics violations; and\n(d) accountability for adherence to the Code of Ethics.\nViolations from standards established in the Code of Ethics, and specifically under internal accounting\ncontrols, are reported to the Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Finance and Corporate Secretary,\nwhich can be done anonymously. The Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Finance and Corporate\nSecretary report to the Audit and Risk Committee, which communicates to the Board any such alleged\nviolations on at least a quarterly basis, or more frequently depending on the specifics of the alleged\nviolations. The Corporation’s Code of Ethics as well as the compliance therewith is reviewed on an annual\nbasis, as employees, directors and officers renew their undertakings. Management of the Corporation\nreports annually to the Governance and Nomination Committee all non-compliance statements so disclosed\nby directors, officers and designated employees.\nThe Corporation’s Code of Ethics provides that directors, officers and employees must avoid conflicts of\ninterests, both real and perceived. In practice, should a director have a material interest or be otherwise in\nconflict of interest with respect to a transaction or agreement considered by the Board, he/she must disclose\nhis/her conflict of interest and withdraw from any discussions, assessment or decision related to the\nparticular transaction or agreement.\nIn the event that any transactions or agreements are contemplated in respect of which a director or\nexecutive officer has a material interest, the matter must be initially reviewed by the Audit and Risk\nCommittee and is then submitted to the Board. The Board may implement any measures that it finds\nnecessary in order to ensure the exercise of independent judgment. In the event a director has a material\ninterest in any transaction or agreement, such director will abstain from voting in that regard.\nIn addition, the Board has established under the Corporation’s Internal Whistleblowing Policy, a process for\nthe receipt and treatment of all complaints concerning accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing or\nany other wrongdoing, including in connection with the Corporation’s Code of Ethics submitted by any\nemployee, including procedures for the confidential anonymous submissions by employees of concerns\nregarding said matters. To help in this process, the Corporation established an Ethics Line, which is a phone\nand internet-based reporting system (1-877-378-7347 or ethics@osiskodev.com).\nThrough the above-noted methods, the Board encourages and promotes a culture of ethical business\nconduct. Specifically, the President, the Chair and Chief Executive Officer and the Governance and\nNomination Committee are responsible for promoting a corporate culture that supports the highest of ethical\nstandards, encourages personal integrity and assumes social responsibility. In addition, the directors,\nofficers and employees of the Corporation are expected to act and to hold their office within the best\ninterests of the Corporation. The Corporation expects that all directors shall act in compliance with all laws\nand regulations applicable to their office as director of the Corporation.\nA copy of the Code of Ethics is available on the Corporation’s website at\nhttps://osiskodev.com/about/#governance. The Corporation may adopt, from time to time, policies and\nguidelines relating to ethics that apply to all directors, officers and employees of the Corporation.\n3.3 Harassment Policy\nOn November 25, 2020, the Board of Directors adopted a policy on the prevention of psychological or\nsexual harassment in the workplace and the handling of complaints (the “Harassment Policy”). The\n2024 Management Information Circular 22\nCorporation does not tolerate or accept any form of psychological or sexual harassment, and the\nHarassment Policy is intended to prevent and put an end to any such situation, including any form of\ndiscriminatory harassment. The Harassment Policy also provides for intervention measures applicable to\nharassment complaints filed or situations of harassment reported to the Corporation. All communications\nare forwarded directly to the Chair of the Human Resources Committee, the Chief Financial Officer and\nVice President, Finance and the Vice President, Exploration. The Harassment Policy is reviewed on an\nannual basis by the Human Resources Committee, which recommends appropriate changes to the\nCorporation’s Board for approval, as applicable.\n3.4 Policy Regarding the Diversity of the Board of Directors\nThe Corporation is committed to diversity among its Board of Directors. On November 25, 2020, the Board\nadopted a written policy regarding the diversity of the Board of Directors (the “Diversity Policy”), following\nrecommendations of the Governance and Nomination Committee. In an increasingly complex global\nmarketplace, the ability to draw on a wide range of viewpoints, backgrounds, skills, and experience is critical\nto the Corporation’s success. By bringing individuals from diverse backgrounds and giving each person the\nopportunity to contribute their skills, experience and perspectives in an inclusive workplace, the Corporation\nbelieves that it is better able to develop solutions to challenges and deliver sustainable value for the\nCorporation and its stakeholders. The Corporation considers diversity to be an important attribute of a well-\nfunctioning Board, which will assist the Corporation in achieving its long-term goals.\nAt all times, the Corporation seeks to maintain a Board comprised of talented and dedicated directors with\na mix of experience, skills and backgrounds collectively reflecting the strategic needs of the business and\nthe nature of the environment in which the Corporation operates. When assessing Board composition or\nidentifying suitable candidates for appointment or re-election to the Board, the Corporation will consider\ncandidates using objective criteria having due regard to the benefits of diversity and the needs of the Board.\nWhen recommending nominees for appointment to the Board, with the goal of enhancing Board diversity,\nthe Governance and Nomination Committee will be guided by (i) identifying candidates who are highly\nqualified based on their experience, expertise, skills and qualities, and (ii) evaluating such candidates based\non their expertise with reference to the skills identified as required by the Board in accordance with the\ndirector skills matrix. When assessing the composition of the Board, the Governance and Nomination\nCommittee’s principal focus is on ensuring that the Board has the diverse experiences, skills and\nbackgrounds needed to oversee collectively the business of the Corporation. The Governance and\nNomination Committee takes a balanced approach when considering the extent to which personal\ncharacteristics are taken into account to ensure the Board can fulfill its role in all respects.\nIn accordance with its Diversity Policy, the Board wishes to maintain at least thirty percent (30%) of women\nrepresentation on the Board of the Corporation. The Board has not adopted formal targets for each of the\nother “Designated Groups” as defined in the Employment Equity Act (namely women, members of a visible\nminority, aboriginal persons or persons with a disability), as the Board considers the representation of the\nDesignated Groups in the process of selecting individual candidates.\nOn an annual basis, the Governance and Nomination Committee reviews the Diversity Policy to ensure it\nis effective in achieving its objectives and the Board continues to meet or exceed the target of 30% of\ndirectors identifying as women. Any changes to the Diversity Policy or additional diversity achievements\nare reported annually in the Corporation’s management information circular. A copy of the Diversity Policy\nis available on the Corporation’s website at https://osiskodev.com/about/#governance.\nThe Corporation nearly achieved its target of having at least thirty percent (30%) of women representation\non the Board of the Corporation for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 as two (2) of the previous\nseven (7) members of the Board identified as women, which represents approximately twenty-nine percent\n(29%) of the total number of directors.\n2024 Management Information Circular 23\nIf all of Management’s nominees for election are elected as directors, women will represent two (2) out of\nthe six (6) members or approximately thirty-three percent (33%) of the total number of directors. The table\nbelow shows the change in gender diversity of the Board’s directors since adopting the Diversity Policy:\n2021 2022 2023 2024(1)\nNumber of women\n3 2 2 2\ndirectors\n% of women directors 38% 33% 29% 33%\nNote:\n(1) These figures assume that all director nominees at the Meeting will be elected.\n3.5 Policy regarding the Diversity in Corporate Talent\nThe Corporation is committed to diversity among its management team. On November 25, 2020, the Board\nadopted a written policy regarding the diversity in corporate talent (the “Management Diversity Policy”)\nfollowing recommendations of the Human Resources Committee.\nIn an increasingly complex global marketplace, the ability to draw on a wide range of viewpoints,\nbackgrounds, skills, and experience is critical to the Corporation’s success. By bringing together individuals\nfrom diverse backgrounds and giving each person the opportunity to contribute their skills, experience and\nperspectives in an inclusive workplace, the Corporation believes that it is better able to develop solutions\nto challenges and deliver sustainable value for the Corporation and its stakeholders. The Corporation\nconsiders diversity as defined in the Management Diversity Policy (“Diversity”) to be an important attribute\nof a well-functioning company, which will assist the Corporation to achieve its long-term goals.\nThe Corporation believes that Diversity enriches discussions and performance of its team in the pursuit of\nits short and long-term corporate objectives. Furthermore, the Corporation believes the promotion of\nDiversity is best served through careful consideration of all of the knowledge, experience, skills and\nbackgrounds of each individual candidate for senior management roles in light of the needs of the\nCorporation without focusing on a single Diversity characteristic and, accordingly, has not adopted specific\ncorporate talent Diversity goals with respect to any of the Designated Groups besides the gender\nrepresentation target. The Corporation considers the representation of the other members of the\nDesignated Groups in the process of selecting individual candidates. As part of its strategy to recruit and\nmaintain a diversified organization, the Corporation will:\n• promote Diversity within its team, with particular emphasis on gender diversity;\n• promote the contribution of women and other members of the Designated Groups to the success\nof the organization;\n• assist in the development of women and other members of the Designated Groups within the\norganization through training, inside sponsorship and outside mentoring;\n• for every open position within the organization, promote the candidacy of at least one woman and\nrepresentatives of the other members of the Designated Groups will be considered as potential\ncandidates;\n• encourage an awareness in all staff of their rights and responsibilities with regard to fairness, equity\nand respect for all aspects of Diversity;\n• actively participate in internal and external initiatives to promote Diversity in its industry with specific\nfocus on gender diversity; and\n• provide a work environment that accommodates family and work life balance, while maintaining a\nhigh achievement culture.\n2024 Management Information Circular 24\nThe Corporation aims to have 25% of senior management roles (as defined under the Management\nDiversity Policy) held by women by December 31, 2024 (the “Target Date”). For the purposes of the\nManagement Diversity Policy, “Senior Management” is defined as including the following individuals: the\nPresident, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, Vice-Presidents and any individual who\nperforms a policy-making function within the Corporation. As of the date hereof, only one (1) of seven (7)\nmembers of Senior Management, which represents approximately 14.29% of Senior Management,\nidentifies as a woman.\nIn addition, amongst nine (9) members of senior management of the Corporation and its major subsidiaries,\nas “senior management” is defined under the Canada Business Corporations Regulations, 2001 (the\n“CBCA Regs”), one (1) member identifies as a woman, which represents 11.11% of senior management\nof the Corporation and its major subsidiaries, as “senior management” is defined under CBCA Regs. No\nmembers of senior management of the Corporation or its major subsidiaries (as “senior management” is\ndefined under the CBCA Regs) identify as members of any other Designated Group.\nThe Management Diversity Policy is reviewed annually by the Human Resources Committee to ensure it is\neffective in achieving its objectives. Any changes to the Management Diversity Policy as well as additional\nDiversity achievements will be reported annually in the Corporation’s management information circular. A\ncopy of the Management Diversity Policy is available on the Corporation’s website at\nhttps://osiskodev.com/about/#governance.\nThe Corporation conducted a voluntary survey on Board and Senior Management Diversity, the objective\nof which was to determine the number of current directors and members of Senior Management who identify\nbeing a member of one or more of the Designated Groups. The results of this survey are presented below.\nAs of the date of this Circular, the Corporation has a total of seven (7) directors and seven (7) members of\nSenior Management, two (2) of which are also a director of the Corporation. The number and proportion of\ndirectors and members of Senior Management who identify as being a member of the four Designated\nGroups are as follows:\nDirectors\nDesignated Group Target Number Achievement\nWomen 30% 2 33.33%(1)\nAboriginal Persons n/a 0 n/a\nPersons with Disabilities n/a 0 n/a\nMembers of Visible Minorities n/a 0 n/a\nNote:\n(1) This figure represents the percentage of women directors on the Board after the Meeting, assuming that all director nominees at the Meeting will be elected.\nSenior Management\nDesignated Group Target Number Achievement\nWomen 25% 1 11.11%\nAboriginal Persons n/a 0 n/a\nPersons with Disabilities n/a 0 n/a\nMembers of Visible Minorities n/a 0 n/a\n3.6 Policy regarding Tenure on the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors is committed to a process of Board renewal and succession-planning for non-\nexecutive directors in order to balance the benefits of experience with the need for new perspectives on the\nBoard while maintaining an appropriate degree of continuity and adequate opportunity for the transition of\nBoard and Board Committee roles and responsibilities. Accordingly, following the recommendations of the\n2024 Management Information Circular 25\nGovernance and Nomination Committee, on November 25, 2020, the Board adopted a policy regarding the\ntenure on the Board (the “Board Tenure Policy”).\nThe Governance and Nomination Committee is responsible for recommending nominees for election to the\nBoard and, in furtherance of such responsibility, it analyzes the competencies and skills of existing non-\nexecutive directors, oversees an annual director evaluation process, and assesses the current and future\nneeds of the Board, including the need to comply with the Corporation’s Diversity Policy.\nIn order to assist the Governance and Nomination Committee and the Board in succession-planning for\nnon-executive directors and appropriate Board renewal, the Board has adopted limits on Board tenure.\nNon-executive directors will not be re-nominated for election at an annual meeting after the earlier of the\nfollowing has occurred:\na) such director has served 12 years following the date on which the director first began\nserving on the Board (the “Term Limit”); or\nb) such director has reached the age of 72 years old on or before the date of the annual or\nspecial meeting of Shareholders of the Corporation called in respect of the election of\ndirectors (the “Retirement Age”);\nprovided that, for greater certainty, there should be no expectation that a non-executive director will\nserve on the Board for the periods contemplated by the Term Limit or until such director reaches the\nRetirement Age (collectively the “Board Tenure Limits”).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Board Tenure Limits shall not apply to a non-executive director who has\nyet to be elected annually for the fifth (5th) consecutive time by the Shareholders. Once a non-executive\ndirector has been elected or re-elected five (5) times, these Board Tenure Limits apply notwithstanding that\nsuch director has continued to receive satisfactory annual performance evaluations, has needed skills and\nexperience and meets other Board policies or legal requirements for Board service.\nExceptionally, on a case-by-case basis and on the recommendation of the Governance and Nomination\nCommittee, a non-executive director who has reached the Term Limit or the Retirement Age may be\nnominated to serve on the Board for up to a maximum of two (2) additional years.\nIn determining whether to make such a recommendation to the Board, the Governance and Nomination\nCommittee shall consider the following factors, among others:\na) whether the director has received positive annual performance assessments;\nb) whether the Governance and Nomination Committee believes it is in the best interests of\nthe Corporation that the director continues to serve on the Board; and\nc) whether the director has been re-elected annually by the Corporation’s shareholders in\naccordance with the Corporation’s Majority Voting Policy.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Board retains full discretion in approving such recommendations by the\nGovernance and Nomination Committee.\nIn addition, directors are expected to inform the Chair of the Board or the Lead Director of any major change\nin their principal occupation so that the Board has the opportunity to decide the appropriateness of such\ndirector’s continuation as a member of the Board or of a Board Committee. Directors are also expected to\nprovide the Chair of the Board or the Lead Director with information as to all boards of directors that they\nsit on or that they have been asked to join so as to allow the Board to determine whether it is appropriate\nfor such director to continue to serve as a member of the Board or of a Board Committee. The Governance\nand Nomination Committee will apply Board nominee selection criteria, including directors’ past\n2024 Management Information Circular 26\ncontributions to the Board and availability to devote sufficient time to fulfill their responsibilities, prior to\nrecommending directors for re-election for another term. A copy of the Board Tenure Policy is available on\nthe Corporation’s website at https://osiskodev.com/about/#governance.

On November 8, 2023, in\naccordance with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing requirements, the Clawback Policy (the\n“Clawback Policy”) was adopted by the Board, replacing the Policy. A copy of the Clawback Policy is\navailable on the Corporation’s website at https://osiskodev.com/about/#governance. The Clawback Policy\napplies to the Corporation’s current or former Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer,\nController, any Vice-President of the Corporation in charge of a principal business unit, division or function,\nand any other current or former officer or person who performs a significant policy-making function for the\nCorporation, including executive officers of the Corporation’s subsidiaries (the “Executive Officers”). The\nClawback Policy allows the Board, in the event of a restatement of the Corporation’s financial results (the\n“Restatement”), at its sole and absolute discretion, to establish and reserve the right to recover:\na) the amount of incentive-based compensation received by the Executive Officer that exceeds the\namount of incentive-based compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been\ndetermined based on the Restatement (the “Recoverable Amount”) calculated in accordance with\nthe rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”);\nb) the excess portion of the equity award that would not have been granted or vested based on the\nRestatement, if the equity award is still outstanding;\nc) if the equity award has been exercised or settled into shares (the “Underlying Shares”), and the\nExecutive Officer still holds the Underlying Shares, the number of Underlying Shares relating to the\nexcess portion of the award (less any exercise price paid for the Underlying Shares); and\nd) if the Underlying Shares have been sold by the Executive Officer, the proceeds received by the\nExecutive Officer from the sale of the Underlying Shares relating to the excess portion of the award\n(less any exercise price paid for the Underlying Shares)\nin each case, during the period (the “Clawback Period”) consisting of any of the three fiscal completed\nyears immediately preceding:\na) the date that the Board (or Audit and Risk Committee) concludes, or reasonably should have\nconcluded, that the Corporation is required to prepare a Restatement; or\nb) the date that a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Corporation to prepare\na Restatement.\nIn no event shall the Corporation be required to award Executive Officers an additional payment if the\nrestated or accurate financial results would have resulted in a higher incentive compensation payment.\nIf the Corporation is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of\nthe Corporation, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under securities laws,\nthen, in accordance with Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer (at the time the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement\nwas originally issued) shall reimburse the Corporation for (i) any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-\nbased compensation received from the Corporation during the 12-month period following the first public\nissuance or filing with the Commission (whichever first occurs) of such financial document and (ii) any\nprofits realized from the sale of securities of the Corporation during that 12-month period.\n3.8 Role of the Board of Directors\nThe primary responsibility of the Board is to supervise the management of the business and affairs of the\nCorporation. In discharging its fiduciary duties, Board members are expected to use their experience and\nexpertise to guide Management and ensure good governance practices are adhered to.

The Lead Director may decide to contact each director and conduct a\nconfidential one-on-one meeting to discuss the results and any issues arising from the performance\nassessments.

Such position descriptions are reviewed by\nthe Governance and Nomination Committee annually and can be found on the Corporation’s website at\nhttps://osiskodev.com/about/#governance.\nOrientation and Continuing Education\nNew directors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with, among other things;\n• The Corporation’s business; • Financial, accounting and risk\nmanagement issues; and\n• Strategic plans;\n• The Corporation’s policies;\nThe Governance and Nomination Committee is responsible for the orientation and education of new\ndirectors of the Corporation and ensures that they understand their roles, duties and responsibilities, and\nthe contribution expected of them.\nIn addition, the Governance and Nomination Committee will ensure that any new director will be given the\nopportunity to become familiar with the Corporation by meeting with the other directors and with the officers\nand representatives of the Corporation as well as the Corporation’s independent auditors, as appropriate.\nThe Corporation provides new directors with a comprehensive briefing of its business activities and finances\nand encourages directors to undergo training relating to the Corporation’s corporate governance matters.\nAs each director has a different skill set and professional background, orientation and training activities are\ntailored to the particular needs and experience of each director. Directors are expected to remain fully\ninformed on all aspects of the Corporation’s business. The Board believes in the importance of ongoing\ndirector education and the need for each director to be personally responsible for this process to meet their\nobligations as directors. Therefore, requests for continuing education for directors are encouraged, and\ndealt with on an ad hoc basis.\nIn the financial year ended December 31, 2023, an external consultant presented an education session on\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance discussing recent changes and updates as well as an\neducation session on cybersecurity and best practices related thereto.\nSecurities Ownership Guidelines Policy\nIn 2021, a formal securities ownership guideline (the “Guideline”) for all non-executive directors and\nexecutive officers (each, an “Executive”) was adopted by the Board in order to further align the long-term\ninterests of the Corporation’s Executives with those of Shareholders. The Guideline provides direction to\nExecutives of the Corporation as to the level and amounts of ownership considered satisfactory in meeting\nthe ownership requirements. The ownership requirements can be met through the holding of Common\nShares, DSUs and restricted share units (“RSUs”). The Guideline was revised by the Board on September\n27, 2023 to better align with governance standards, as reflected in the table below.\nThe following table illustrates the amounts and levels established for the minimum requirement for\nExecutives:\nSecurities Ownership Levels\nCategories\n(as Multiple of Annual Base Salary Level/Retainer)\nNon-Executive Directors (including the Lead Director) 8.0 Times Cash Component of Basic Retainer\nChief Executive Officer 3.0 Times Cash Component of Annual Base Salary\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Senior\nVice Presidents 2.0 Times Cash Component of Annual Base Salary\nVice Presidents 1.0 Times Cash Component of Annual Base Salary\nNewly elected or appointed Executives have three (3) years to comply with the ownership requirements\nfrom the date of election or appointment. Further to a salary increase, any Executive whose salary has\nbeen so increased shall also have three (3) years to comply with the increased level of ownership\nrequirements deriving from such salary increase, starting from the effective date of such increase. This also\napplies to any Executive whose capacity changes and, in turn, increases the ownership requirements. Once\nthe requirements have been met, the Executive will be deemed to be compliant on an ongoing basis unless\nthe Executive disposes of securities resulting in that Executive’s securities ownership falling below the\napplicable threshold. The method of calculation for the determination of the value of the securities held, is\nbased on the Exchange closing price of the Common Shares of the Corporation on December 31st or, if this\ndate is not a trading day, on the last Exchange trading day of the year. As of the Record Date, all non-\nexecutive directors have met their securities ownership requirements. The remaining Executives appointed\nin 2021 are currently on track to meet their securities ownership requirements by the initial compliance\ndeadline in 2024.\n2024 Management Information Circular 39\nPART 4: DIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n4.1 Directors’ Compensation\nThe Corporation’s director compensation program is designed to attract and retain qualified people to serve\non its Board and its Board Committees and considers the risks and responsibilities of being an effective\ndirector. It further serves to align the interests of directors with those of Shareholders over the long-term.\nThe Board sets the compensation of non-executive directors based on the Human Resources Committee’s\nrecommendations. Any director who is also an employee of the Corporation or any of its affiliates or\nsubsidiaries does not receive any compensation as a director.\nThe composition of the non-executive directors’ total compensation was approved by the Board on\nDecember 22, 2020 and is reviewed by the Human Resources Committee on an annual basis and has\nremained unchanged. It consists of (i) an annual retainer, (ii) attendance fees and (iii) share-based\nremuneration in the form of DSUs, the respective values of which are determined by the Human Resources\nCommittee from time to time and recommended for approval to the Board of Directors.\nRetainer, attendance fees and share-based remuneration\nThe annual retainer and attendance fees paid to non-executive Board and Board Committee members are\npaid on a quarterly basis.\nThe Board makes fixed value DSU grants to non-executive directors. The Board adopted the DSU Plan,\nwhich is further described below under the heading “Deferred Share Unit Plan”, and elected to fix an\nannual value to such grant at approximately $120,000 for the non-executive Board members and\napproximately $180,000 for the Lead Director. Furthermore, each new non-executive director is granted an\ninitial one-time grant having a value of approximately $200,000 ($300,000 for the Lead Director). Such\ninitial DSU grants (the “Initial DSU Grants”) are consistent with the practice of welcoming new non-\nexecutive Board members by making an initial long-term incentive award. With respect to the annual grant\nof DSUs to a non-executive director in the year following the receipt of the Initial DSU Grant, such annual\ngrant is pro-rated to take into account that the Initial DSU Grant shall cover an initial period of twelve (12)\nmonths.\nThe following table shows the annual retainers, attendance fees as well as initial and annual DSU grants\npaid to non-executive directors during 2023:\nRETAINERS\nANNUAL RETAINERS  Board AND FEES\n($)\nNon-executive director of the Board 40,000\nAdditional retainer allocated to the Lead Director of the Board 60,000\nANNUAL RETAINERS  Committees/Members and Chairs ($)\nChair of the Audit and Risk Committee 20,000\nChair of all other Committees 10,000\nNon-executive member of a Committee 5,000\nPER MEETING FEES  Attendance/Travel ($)\n2024 Management Information Circular 47\nRETAINERS\nANNUAL RETAINERS  Board AND FEES\n($)\nBoard and Committee Meeting Attendance Fees\n1,500\n(in person or via conference call)\nBoard and Committee Meeting Per Diem Fee\n(payable to non-executive directors who are required to travel for at least four (4) hours to attend a 1,000\nmeeting)\nDSUs  Initial and Annual ($ Value) ($)\nAnnual grant to the Lead Director of the Board 180,000\nAnnual grant to a non-executive director of the Board 120,000\nInitial one-time grant to the Lead Director 300,000\nInitial one-time grant to a new non-executive director 200,000\nDirector Summary Compensation Table\nThe following table provides a summary of the compensation received by each director of the Corporation\nfor the most recently completed financial year, with the exception of Sean Roosen, Chair of the Board of\nDirectors and Chief Executive Officer, and Éric Tremblay, Director and interim Chief Operating Officer, who\ndid not receive any compensation for acting as directors of the Corporation and whose compensation is\ndisclosed in the Named Executive Summary Compensation Table in section 4.2 Directors and Executive\nCompensation – Statement of Executive Compensation - Named Executive Summary Compensation Table\nin this Circular.\nShare- Option- Non-Equity\nAnnual Attendance Pension All Other\nName and Based Based Incentive Plan Total\nRetainer Fees Value Compensation\nPosition Awards Awards Compensation ($)\n($) ($) ($) ($)\n($)(1) ($) ($)\nDavid Danziger\n47,211 25,500 50,000(2) - - - - 122,711\nDirector\nMarina Katusa,\n45,000 18,000 120,000 - - - - 183,000\nDirector\nMichèle McCarthy\n73,980 31,500 120,000 - - - - 225,480\nDirector\nDuncan\nMiddlemiss 60,000 33,000 120,000 - - - - 213,000\nDirector\nCharles E.

On November\n24, 2021, the Exchange implemented certain changes to its policies regarding security based\ncompensation. As a result of these changes, the Corporation amended and restated the DSU Plan to\nensure that it complied with the requirements of the Exchange.\nThe Amended DSU Plan supersedes and replaces the existing DSU Plan, provided that any outstanding\nDSUs granted thereunder prior to the date of this Meeting shall remain in effect in accordance with the\nterms and conditions of the DSU Plan.\nSummary of the Amended DSU Plan\nThe following is a summary of the key provisions of the Amended DSU Plan.

More specifically, it shall take into account the following objectives:\n• Attract, motivate and retain highly qualified and experienced executives;\n• Recognize and reward contributions to the success of the Corporation as measured by the\naccomplishment of performance objectives;\n• Ensure that a significant proportion of compensation is directly linked to the success of the\nCorporation while not encouraging excessive or inappropriate risk-taking;\n• Promote adherence to the high standards and values reflected in the Corporation’s Code of Ethics;\n• Ensure retention by setting total direct compensation targets at a level that is competitive with the\nmarkets in which the Corporation competes; and\n• Protect long-term Shareholder interests by ensuring Named Executives of the Corporation (as\nhereinafter defined) and other interests are aligned with those of Shareholders.\nThe Board of Directors of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and administrating a compensation\nprogram for the Named Executives. The Board has delegated the oversight of the compensation program\nand human resources matters to the Human Resources Committee, composed entirely of independent\ndirectors. For more information regarding the Human Resources Committee, see section 3.8 About Osisko\nDevelopment - Role of the Board of Directors – Committees of the Board – Human Resources Committee\nof this Circular.\n2024 Management Information Circular 53\nIn establishing such compensation programs, the Human Resources Committee consults the Chair and\nChief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Finance and\nCorporate Secretary. The Human Resources Committee monitors compensation trends within the mining\nindustry and seeks input from external advisors, as required.\nRisk Mitigation\nThe Human Resources Committee monitors and reviews the implications of the risks associated with the\nCorporation’s compensation program. The risk mitigation features include (i) an annual bonus payment to\nexecutive officers capped at 200% of the target payment, subject to performance factors based on shared\nperformance objectives; (ii) a Clawback Policy which authorizes the Board to recover from an Executive\nOfficer compensation paid under the Incentive Compensation in the event of a recalculation, as described\nin further detail in section 3.7 About Osisko Development – Policy on Recovery of Incentive Compensation\nof this Circular; (iii) a securities trading policy that helps align interests; (iv) RSU and DSU plans to promote\nalignment of interests between directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders of the Corporation; and (v)\nshort-term equity-based compensation.\nBased on the review performed in the last financial year, no risks associated with the Corporation’s\ncompensation policies and practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\nwere identified. The Human Resources Committee considers that the procedures and guidelines currently\nin place to mitigate key risks relating to compensation are adequately managed and do not encourage\nexcessive risk taking that would likely have a material adverse effect on the Corporation. The Human\nResources Committee will continue to monitor and review the Corporation’s compensation policies and\npractices annually to ensure that no component of the Named Executives’ compensation values risk taking.\nNamed Executive Officers\nFor purposes of this Circular, named executives (“Named Executives”) of the Corporation means, at any\ntime during the most recently completed financial year:\n• The Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer;\n• The Corporation’s Chief Financial Officer;\n• Each of the three most highly compensated executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer\nand the Chief Financial Officer at the end of the most recently completed financial year whose total\ncompensation was more than $150,000 for that financial year; and\n• Each individual who would be a Named Executive under the paragraph above but for the fact that\nthe individual was neither an executive officer of the Corporation, nor acting in a similar capacity,\nat the end of that financial year.\nDuring the Corporation’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the following individuals were Named\nExecutives of the Corporation:\n• Sean Roosen, Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer;\n• Alexander Dann, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Finance;\n• Éric Tremblay, Former Senior Manager (until December 31, 2023) and Interim Chief Operating\nOfficer (from December 31, 2023);\n• Luc Lessard, Former Chief Operating Officer (until December 31, 2023);\n• Chris Lodder, President; and\n2024 Management Information Circular 54\n• Francois Vézina, Former Senior Vice President, Project Development, Technical Services and\nEnvironment (until March 1, 2024).\nNamed Executives do not control a number of significant factors that impact financial results, including\ncommodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and regulatory uncertainty. The Corporation’s compensation\nprogram design thus considers factors over which the executive officers can exercise control, such as\nmeeting budget targets established by the Board at the beginning of each year, controlling costs, mitigating\nrisks, taking successful advantage of business opportunities and enhancing the competitive and business\nprospects of the Corporation.\nCompensation Components\nAs is typical in the mining industry, the Corporation’s executive compensation policy applicable to Named\nExecutives is comprised of a combination of:\n• Cash base salary;\n• Cash annual incentive bonus; and\n• Equity-linked long-term incentive compensation in the form of Option grants and RSU grants.\nElements Description Objectives\nBase salary is generally determined through an analysis of a comparator Attraction, retention and motivation;\nBase Salary group. It reflects the capability of the individual as demonstrated over an\nAnnual salary adjustments as appropriate.\nextended period of time.\nAnnual cash incentive bonus is a portion of variable compensation that is Pay for performance;\nAnnual Incentive designed to reward executives on an annual basis for achievement of\nAlign with business strategy;\nBonus corporate and business objectives, relative to corporate and individual\nperformance. Attraction, retention and motivation.\nAlign to Shareholder interests;\nEquity compensation is a portion of variable compensation that is designed\nLong-Term Incentives to align executive and Shareholder interests, focus executives on long-term Pay for performance;\nvalue creation, and also support the retention of key executives.\nAttraction, retention and motivation.\nThe combination of base salaries, annual incentive, Option grants and RSU grants (which are payable in\ncash or in Common Shares, at the Corporation’s discretion, as at the end of a three (3)-year vesting period),\nreflects the Corporation’s evolving nature and is intended to attract and retain talent in a competitive\nemployment market. Grant of Options and RSUs to Named Executives are made on an annual basis, at a\nmoment deemed appropriate by the Human Resources Committee. Annual incentive, Option grants and\nRSU grants (timed-based and performance-based) represent the value at risk portion of the total\ncompensation of each Named Executive.\nFor any grant, Options vest as to one third of the total grant at each of the first three anniversaries of such\ngrant, unless otherwise decided by the Human Resources Committee, as provided for in the Amended\nSOP. RSU grants are generally subject to the following vesting terms: one half (1/2) is time-based and\nvests on the third anniversary of such grant while the remaining half (1/2), which also vests on the third\nanniversary of such grant, is subject to the achievement of long-term objectives over a three-year period.\nNo long-term objectives have yet been set in connection with annual grants of RSUs. Such long-term\nperformance criteria will be approved in 2024 to align Named Executives’ interests with those of\nShareholders and to further promote value creation.\n2024 Management Information Circular 55\nOptions and RSUs also enable the Corporation to balance the ratio of long-term to short-term compensation\nto levels commensurate with mining industry companies and to enhance Named Executives’ alignment with\nShareholder value creation. The Amended SOP and RSU Plan are further described below.\nThe table below indicates for each of the three (3) components described above, the target compensation\nmix of the Named Executives. The Corporation is committed to ensuring that the pay mix of its Named\nExecutives is competitive and in line with general market practice. The target compensation mix of the\nNamed Executives described below highlights the Corporation’s focus on pay at risk, which will help align\nexecutives’ pay with the Corporation’s performance over both the short- and long-term. The implementation\nof diverse incentive plans prompts executives to take into account the effects of their decisions on both\nimmediate and future outcomes.\nPercentage of Total Target Direct Compensation\nLong-Term Incentives\nAnnual Incentive\nBase Salary\nCompensation\nAt-risk\nOptions RSUs compensation(1)\nNamed Executive\nTarget Actual Target Actual Target Actual Target Actual\nTarget Actual\nSean Roosen, Chair and Chief\n20% 21% 20% 16% 42% 44% 18% 19% 80% 79%\nExecutive Officer\nAlexander Dann, CFO and Vice\n23% 25% 23% 17% 37% 40% 17% 18% 77% 74%\nPresident, Finance (2)\nÉric Tremblay, Interim Chief\n50% 58% 50% 42% 0% 0% 0% 0% 50% 42%\nOperating Officer\nLuc Lessard, Former Chief Operating\n29% 100% 71% 0%(3) 0% 0% 0% 0% 71% 0%\nOfficer\nChris Lodder, President 23% 25% 23% 17% 37% 40% 17% 18% 77% 75%\nFrancois Vézina, Former Senior Vice\nPresident, Project Development,\n25% 33% 25% 0%(3) 35% 47% 15% 20% 75% 67%\nTechnical Services and\nEnvironment(3)\nNotes:\n(1) At-risk compensation represents the sum of the annual incentive compensation and the long-term incentives.\n(2) In 2023, salary adjustments were made to Mr. Dann, the Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Finance of the Corporation, in order to adjust his salary and target incentives\nto the current market, in comparison with companies of the same industry and size. While previously the annual base salary was $300,000, it was increased to $350,000.\nMoreover, the short term incentive target which previously had been 50% of the base salary was increased to 100% of the base salary.\n(3) In light of his impending retirement, Mr. Lessard did not receive any annual incentives for the 2023 fiscal year. It was agreed between the Corporation and Mr. Vézina that, in\nconnection with his resignation, he would not receive any annual incentives for the 2023 fiscal year.\nBase Salary\nThe base salary is the only fixed component of the compensation of the Named Executives. The\nCorporation’s objective is to establish base salaries for executive officers that are competitive with relevant\nsalaries paid to executive officers of a comparator group, while recognizing executive officers’ experience,\n2024 Management Information Circular 56\ncompetencies and track record of accomplishments and preserving a “team approach” toward\nremuneration. Salary levels shall therefore consider the overall corporate performance of the Corporation,\ncomparative market data and individual performance.\nAnnual Incentive Compensation\nThe Human Resources Committee believes that long-term growth of value for Shareholders is derived from\nthe execution of short and long-term approved strategic initiatives.\nThe annual incentive program for the Named Executives is based on their performance as a team against\ncorporate objectives approved by the Board. Bonuses are paid in full following awards approved by the\nBoard, based on the recommendation of the Human Resources Committee. While the target for annual\nincentive compensation for Named Executives has been contractually established at 100% of their\nrespective base salary, the Board retains full discretion in assessing such achievement. In addition, the\nBoard may also factor in individual achievement, if warranted. For greater certainty, annual incentive\ncompensation does not represent a guaranteed compensation item for the Named Executives as\nthe determination of the performance relating to such compensation remains the sole prerogative\nof the Board who can decide not to pay any bonus to any Named Executive.\nAs part of its duties and responsibilities and in conjunction with year-end assessments, the Human\nResources Committee reviews the realization of the Corporation’s objectives and meets with Management\nto discuss and consider each element contained in the corporate objectives. The Human Resources\nCommittee also meets in camera to discuss this matter.\nThe Corporation’s 2023 short-term key objectives (the “2023 Key Objectives”) consist of elements included\nin the following four main criteria: (i) Performance; (ii) Financial; (iii) Project Development; and (iv) ESG.\nThe 2023 Key Objectives were approved by the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Human\nResources Committee. Such objectives provided for hurdle rates which could result in payment ranging\nfrom 0% to a maximum of 200%, depending on the assessment of the achievement of approved objectives\nby the management team. The Human Resources Committee monitored the progress made by\nManagement toward achieving said objectives. The Human Resources Committee reviewed achievements\nagainst the Corporation’s objectives, discussed with Management and thereafter, the Human Resources\nCommittee met in camera to discuss and consider the payout under the short-term incentive program.\nThe Human Resources Committee provided its recommendation to the Board which also deliberated with\nthe presence of senior members of Management and determined and approved the following assessment\nof the 2023 Key Objectives set forth below:\n2024 Management Information Circular 57\nActual\n2023 STIP Suggested Criteria(1) Target (100%) Target Weight Achievement\nWeight\n1.

Mr. Tremblay received, for his services as an employee performed between October 1, 2022 and December 31,\n2022, an annual incentive award of $95,625.\n(2) As per the terms and conditions of the Management and Technical Services Agreement entered into between the Corporation and Falco Resources Ltd. (“Falco”), Mr. Lessard’s\ncompensation for services rendered under the Management Technical Services Agreement in 2023 was in the amount of $300,000, which amount is originally paid by Osisko\nDevelopment and thereafter invoiced to Falco on a monthly basis. The Management and Technical Services Agreement was terminated as of December 31, 2023.\n(3) In light of his impending retirement, Mr. Lessard did not receive any annual incentives for the 2023 fiscal year. It was agreed between the Corporation and Mr. Vézina that, in\nconnection with his resignation, he would not receive any annual incentives for the 2023 fiscal year.\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation\nThe Human Resources Committee shall manage the Corporation’s equity plans with full authority. The\nHuman Resources Committee shall consider ad hoc and annual grants of Options and RSUs to Named\nExecutives based on recommendations made by the Chair of the Board and Chief Executive officer from\ntime to time, for participants other than himself. The Human Resources Committee, in turn, shall consider\nsuch recommendations and, as appropriate, shall make recommendations to the Board. In reviewing\nManagement’s recommendation relating to grants under the Corporation’s equity plans, the Human\nResources Committee and the Board may consider past grants and factor in any such grants made by\nassociate companies to any of the Corporation’s Named Executives.\nThe following table sets out the long-term incentive specified target rate for each Named Executive and the\ngrants made for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, as a percentage of the Named Executive’s\ntotal cash compensation (i.e., the sum of his or her base salary and target annual incentive compensation):\n2024 Management Information Circular 59\nActual Grant\nSpecified\nNamed Executive\nTarget Rate RSUs(1) Options(2)\nRate\n($) ($)\nSean Roosen, Chair and Chief Executive Officer 150% 150% 472,500 1,102,500\nAlexander Dann, Chief Financial Officer and Vice\n115% 115% 241,500 563,500\nPresident, Finance\nÉric Tremblay, Interim Chief Operating Officer\n115% 76% 0 787,512\nLuc Lessard, Former Chief Operating Officer(3)\n125% 0% 0 0\nChris Lodder, President 115% 115% 293,250 684,250\nFrancois Vézina, Former Senior Vice President,\nProject Development, Technical Services and 100% 100% 180,000 420,000\nEnvironment\nNotes:\n(1) Based on the closing price of the Common Shares of the Corporation on the Exchange on the grant date April 3, 2023 ($6.59).\n(2) Calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n(3) As per the terms and conditions of the Management and Technical Services Agreement entered into between the Corporation and Falco, Mr. Lessard’s compensation is\noriginally paid by Osisko Development and thereafter invoiced to Falco on a monthly basis. A total of $300,000 was recharged to and paid by Falco in 2023. Mr. Lessard’s long-\nterm incentive grant is, however, calculated based on his total cash compensation received from the Corporation prior to taking into account the recharge to Falco. In light of\nhis impending retirement, Mr. Lessard did not participate in the long term incentives for the 2023 fiscal year.\nOptions\nThe purpose of the Amended SOP of the Corporation is to advance the interests of each subsidiary by\nencouraging the directors, officers, consultants and employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to\nacquire Common Shares, thereby increasing their proprietary interest in the Corporation, encouraging them\nto remain associated with the Corporation and/or subsidiaries and furnishing them with an additional\nincentive in their efforts on behalf of the Corporation and/or subsidiaries. Under the policies of the\nExchange, the Corporation’s Amended SOP will require annual Shareholder approval at each annual\nmeeting of the Corporation.\nAs mentioned in section 2.4 Business of the Meeting – Approval of the Corporation’s Amended Stock Option\nPlan of this Circular, the Corporation amended the SOP to ensure that it complies with the current\nrequirements of the Exchange.\nThe Amended SOP supersedes and replaces the existing SOP, provided that any outstanding Options\ngranted thereunder prior to the date of this Meeting shall remain in effect in accordance with the terms and\nconditions of the SOP.\nSummary of the Amended SOP\nThe following is a summary of the key provisions of the Amended SOP. This summary is qualified in all\nrespects by the full text of the Amended SOP, a copy of which is available on the Corporation’s website at\nhttps://osiskodev.com/about/#governance.

In accordance with the policies of the Exchange, and subject to\ntheir approval to the contrary, Options issued to any Investor Relations\nService Provider must vest (and not otherwise be exercisable) in stages over\na minimum of 12 months with not more than 25% of the Options vesting in\nany three month period.\nEffect of Death or Upon the death of the Participant, any Options held by such Participant will\nTermination automatically vest and may be exercised in whole or in part by the legal\nperson representing the Participant during a period commencing on the date\nof death and ending one year thereafter or on the expiry date, whichever\ncomes first.\nIf the Participant ceases to be a director or officer of, be in the employ of, or\nbe providing ongoing management or consulting services to, the\nCorporation, any Options held by such Participant will terminate on the\nearlier of the expiry date of the Option and the 90th day following the date\non which the Participant ceases to be a director, officer or employee of the\nCorporation, or ceases to provide ongoing management or consulting\nservices to the Corporation, as the case may be (or such lesser period as\nmay be specified by the Board or a committee designated by the Board, at\nthe time of grant). If the Participant ceases to be employed to provide\nInvestor Relations Activities on behalf of the Corporation, any Options held\nby such Participant will terminate on the earlier of the 30th day following the\ndate on which the Participant ceases to be employed to provide Investor\nRelations Activities to the Corporation (or such lesser period as may be\nspecified by the Board or a committee designated by the Board, at the time\nof grant).\nChanges in Share Appropriate adjustments in the number of Common Shares optioned, the\nCapital aggregate number of Common Shares reserved for issue pursuant to\nOptions and the exercise price per Common Share, as regards Options\ngranted or to be granted, will be made by the Board to give effect to\nadjustments in the number of Common Shares of the Corporation resulting\nfrom subdivisions, consolidations, reclassification of the shares of the\nCorporation, the payment of stock dividends and any merger, amalgamation\nor reorganization to which the Corporation is a party.\nAmendments The Board may amend or change the Amended SOP and any Options\ngranted under it from time to time, subject to receipt of consents or approvals\nof all applicable authorities and exchanges.\nOptions Exercised during the Year\nNo Options were exercised during the financial year ended December 31, 2023.\nAmended Restricted Share Unit Plan\nThe purpose of the Corporation’s Amended RSU Plan is to assist the Corporation and its subsidiaries in\nattracting and retaining individuals with experience and ability, to allow certain employees of the Corporation\nand its subsidiaries to participate in the long-term success of the Corporation and to promote a greater\nalignment of interests between the employees designated under the Corporation’s RSU Plan and the\nShareholders.\n2024 Management Information Circular 62\nThe Amended RSU Plan provides for the grant of restricted share units (“RSUs”) to eligible participants. An\nRSU award granted to a participant for services rendered will entitle the participant, subject to the\nparticipant’s satisfaction of any conditions, restrictions or limitations imposed under the Amended RSU Plan\nor RSU grant letter, to receive a payment in fully paid Common Shares, in cash or a combination of both\non the date when the RSU award is fully vested. Since the value of RSUs increase or decrease with the\nprice of the Common Shares, RSUs achieve the compensation objective of aligning the interests of\nparticipants with those of Shareholders. In addition, RSUs have both time-based and performance-based\nvesting features that can be used to better motivate executives and to encourage qualified and experienced\nexecutives to make long-term commitments to the Corporation.\nThe Shareholders of the Corporation first approved the RSU Plan on November 20, 2020 (the “RSU Plan”).\nOn November 24, 2021, the Exchange implemented certain changes to its policies regarding security based\ncompensation. As a result of the changes, the Corporation wishes to amend and restate the RSU Plan to\nensure that it complies with the current requirements of the Exchange (the RSU Plan, as amended, being\nreferred to herein as the “Amended RSU Plan”).\nThe Amended RSU Plan supersedes and replaces the existing RSU Plan, provided that any outstanding\nRSUs granted thereunder prior to the date of this Meeting shall remain in effect in accordance with the\nterms and conditions of the RSU Plan.\nSummary of the Amended RSU Plan\nThe following is a summary of the key provisions of the Amended RSU Plan. This summary is qualified in\nall respects by the full text of the Amended RSU Plan, a copy of which is available on the Corporation’s\nwebsite at https://osiskodev.com/about/#governance. All terms used but not defined in this section have\nthe meaning ascribed thereto in the Amended RSU Plan.\n2024 Management Information Circular 63\nEligible Participants The Board shall from time to time determine the employees, officers,\ndirectors and consultants who may participate in the Amended RSU Plan.\nNumber of Common The aggregate number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the\nShares Amended RSU Plan, subject to certain adjustments as described in the\nAmended RSU Plan, must not exceed 1,333,333 Common Shares, provided\nthat the aggregate number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under\nthe Amended RSU Plan and pursuant to any other security-based\ncompensation arrangements of the Corporation must not, in the aggregate,\nexceed 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares as of each date\non which RSUs are granted under the Amended RSU Plan.\nAny Common Shares subject to a RSU which has been cancelled or\nterminated in accordance with the terms of the Amended RSU Plan without\nsettlement will again be available under the Amended RSU Plan.\nParticipation Limits The maximum number of Common Shares issuable to Insiders, at any time,\npursuant to the Amended RSU Plan and all other security-based\ncompensation arrangements of the Corporation is 10% of the total number\nof Common Shares then outstanding.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its\ninternal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Nature of operations and going concern\nOsisko Development Corp. (“Osisko Development” or the “Company”) is a mineral exploration and development\ncompany focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of precious metals resource properties in North\nAmerica. Osisko Development is focused on exploring and developing its mining assets, including the Cariboo Gold\nProject in British Columbia, the San Antonio gold project in Mexico and the Trixie test mine in the USA.\nThe Company’s registered and business address is 1100, avenue des Canadiens-de-Montréal, suite 300, Montreal,\nQuébec and is constituted under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The common shares of Osisko Development\ntrade under the symbol ODV on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”) and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).\nAs at December 31, 2023, the former parent Company, Osisko Gold Royalties (“OGR”) held an interest of 39.7% in\nOsisko Development (compared to 44.1% as at December 31, 2022). Effective September 30, 2022, following certain\nchanges made to OGR’s investment agreement with Osisko Development, OGR no longer controls Osisko\nDevelopment.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going\nconcern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business as\nthey come due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, Management takes into account all\navailable information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve months from the end of the reporting\nyear. As at December 31, 2023, the Company’s working capital was $21.9 million, which included cash and cash\nequivalent balance of $43.5 million. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of $510.9 million and incurred a loss\nof $181.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe working capital position as at December 31, 2023 will not be sufficient to meet the Company’s obligations,\ncommitments and forecasted expenditures up to the year ending December 31, 2024. Management is aware, in making\nits assessment, of material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon the\nCompany's ability to continue as a going concern as described in the preceding paragraph, and accordingly, the\nappropriateness of the use of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. These consolidated financial\nstatements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, expenses and financial position\nclassifications that would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These adjustments could\nbe material.\nThe Company’s ability to continue future operations and fund its planned activities is dependent on Management’s\nability to secure additional financing in the future, which may be completed in several ways including, but not limited to,\na combination of selling additional investments from its portfolio, project debt finance, offtake or royalty financing and\nother capital market alternatives. Failure to secure future financings may impact and/or curtail the planned activities for\nthe Company, which may include, but are not limited to, the suspension of certain development activities and the\ndisposal of certain investments to generate liquidity. While Management has been successful in securing financing in\nthe past, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future or that these sources of funding or initiatives\nwill be available to the Company or that they will be available on terms which are acceptable to the Company. If\nManagement is unable to obtain new funding, the Company may be unable to continue its operations, and amounts\nrealized for assets might be less than the amounts reflected in these consolidated financial statements.\n9\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\n2. Basis of presentation and Statement of compliance\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting\nStandards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). The accounting policies,\nmethods of computation and presentation applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are\nconsistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the presentation of certain operating cash flows\nadjustments. The comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2022 were adjusted accordingly.\nThe Board of Directors approved these consolidated financial statements for issue on March 28, 2024.\n3. Material Accounting Policies\nThe material accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described below.\na) Basis of measurement\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of\ncertain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value (including derivative instruments), as described in Note 3(e)\nbelow.\nb) Business combinations\nOn the acquisition of a business, the acquisition method of accounting is used whereby the identifiable assets, liabilities\nand contingent liabilities (identifiable net assets) of the business are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.\nProvisional fair values estimated at a reporting date are finalized as soon as the relevant information is available, which\nperiod shall not exceed twelve months from the acquisition date and are adjusted to reflect the transaction as of the\nacquisition date. Any excess of the consideration paid is treated as goodwill, and any bargain gain is immediately\nrecognized in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss. If control is lost as a result of a transaction, the participation\nretained is recognized on the statement of financial position at fair value and the difference between the fair value\nrecognized and the carrying value as at the date of the transaction is recognized in the statement of loss. Acquisition\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at\nfair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree’s identifiable\nnet assets.\nThe results of businesses acquired during the year are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements from the\ndate on which control commences (generally at the closing date when the acquirer legally transfers the consideration).\nc) Consolidation\nThe Company’s financial statements consolidate the accounts of Osisko Development Corp. and its subsidiaries. All\nintercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains or losses from intercompany transactions are eliminated on\nconsolidation. Subsidiaries are defined as all entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise control. The\nCompany controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with\nthe entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated\nfrom the date on which control is transferred to the Company and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\n10\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nThe principal subsidiaries of the Company, their geographic locations and their related participation at December 31,\n2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nEntity Jurisdiction % ownership Functional currency\nBarkerville Gold Mines Ltd. (“Barkerville”) British Columbia 100 % Canadian dollar\nSapuchi Minera, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Sapuchi”) Mexico 100 % Mexican peso\nTintic Consolidated Metals LLC (“Tintic”) Utah, USA 100 % United States dollar\nd) Foreign currency translation\n(i) Functional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each consolidated entity and associate of the Company are measured\nusing the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “Functional Currency”). The\nconsolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the functional currency of the parent\nCompany and some of its subsidiaries.\nAssets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that have a Functional Currency other than the Canadian dollar are translated\ninto Canadian dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the consolidated statement of financial position date and\nrevenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate over the reporting period. Gains and losses from\nthese translations are recognized as currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income or loss.\n(ii) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions, including revenues and expenses, are translated into the Functional Currency at the rate\nof exchange prevailing on the date of each transaction or valuation when items are re-measured. Monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than the operation’s functional currencies are translated into the Functional\nCurrency at exchange rates in effect at the statement of financial position date. Foreign exchange gains and losses\nresulting from the settlement of those transactions and from period-end translations are recognized in the consolidated\nstatement of loss.\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates, unless such assets and liabilities are carried at fair\nvalue, in which case, they are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the date of the fair value measurement.\nChanges in fair value attributable to currency fluctuations of non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities\nheld at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in the consolidated statement of loss as part of the fair value gain\nor loss. Such changes in fair value of non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified at fair value through\nother comprehensive income, are included in other comprehensive income or loss.\ne) Financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions\nof the instrument. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired\nor have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.\nAll financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. The fair value is based on quoted\nmarket prices unless the financial instruments are not traded in an active market. In this case, the fair value is determined\nby using valuation techniques like the Black-Scholes option pricing model or other acceptable valuation techniques.\nMeasurement after initial recognition depends on the classification of the financial instrument. The Company has\nclassified its financial instruments in the following categories depending on the purpose for which the instruments were\nacquired and their characteristics.\n11\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\n(i) Financial assets\nDebt instruments\nInvestments in debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortized cost when the asset is held within a business\nmodel whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and when the contractual terms of the\nfinancial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal\namount outstanding.\nInvestments in debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value when they do not qualify for measurement at\namortized cost. Financial instruments subsequently measured at fair value, including derivatives that are assets, are\ncarried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in net income or loss unless they are held within a business\nmodel whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows or sell the assets and when the\ncontractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal\nand interest on the principal amount outstanding, in which case unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in\nother comprehensive income or loss for subsequent reclassification to net income or loss through amortization of\npremiums and discounts, impairment or derecognition.\nEquity instruments\nInvestments in equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with changes recorded in net income or loss.\nEquity instruments that are not held for trading can be irrevocably designated at fair value through other comprehensive\nincome or loss on initial recognition without subsequent reclassification to net income or loss. Cumulative gains and\nlosses are transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (deficit) upon\nderecognition of the investment.\n(ii) Financial Liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for financial\nliabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, are subsequently\nmeasured at fair value.\n12\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nThe Company has classified its financial instruments as follows:\nCategory Financial instrument\nFinancial assets at amortized cost Bank balances (including restricted cash)\nInvestment in money market funds\nShort-term debt securities\nReclamation deposits\nT rade receivables\nIntere st income receivable\nA mounts receivable from associates and other\nreceivables\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss Investments in derivatives (warrants)\nFinancial assets at fair value through other Investments in shares and equity instruments, other\ncomprehensive income or loss than in derivatives\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost Accounts payable and accrued liabilities Borrowings\nunder loan facilities\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Warrants liability\nf) Impairment of financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Company assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with\nits financial assets carried at amortized cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been\na significant increase in the credit risk or if a simplified approach has been selected.\nThe Company has two principal types of financial assets subject to the expected credit loss model:\n• Trade receivables; and\n• Amounts receivable\nThe Company applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 for trade receivables (including amounts receivable\nfrom associates and other receivables), which requires lifetime expected credit losses to be recognized from initial\nrecognition of the receivables.\ng) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of\nthree months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are exposed to an insignificant\nrisk of changes in value.\nh) Refundable tax credits for mining exploration expenses\nThe Company is entitled to refundable tax credits on qualified mining exploration and evaluation expenses incurred in\nthe provinces of Québec and British-Columbia. The credits are accounted for against the exploration and evaluation\nexpenses incurred.\n13\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\ni) Inventories\nSupplies inventory consists of mining supplies and consumables used in the operations and is valued at the lower of\naverage cost and net realizable value. Provisions are recorded to reflect present intentions for the use of slow moving\nand obsolete parts and supplies inventory.\nInventories of stockpile, in-circuit and refined precious metals are measured and valued at the lower of average\nproduction cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of the equivalent metals in\nthe ordinary course of business based on the prevailing metal prices on the reporting date, less estimated costs to\ncomplete production and to bring the finished goods to sale. Production costs that are inventoried include the costs\ndirectly related to bringing the inventory to its current condition and location, such as materials, labour, other direct costs\n(including external services and depreciation, depletion and amortization) and production related overheads.\nj) Investments in associates\nAssociates are entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control. The financial results of the\nCompany’s investments in its associates are included in the Company’s results according to the equity method. Under\nthe equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to\nrecognize the Company’s share of profits or losses of associates after the date of acquisition. The Company’s share of\nprofits or losses is recognized in the consolidated statement of income or loss and its share of other comprehensive\nincome or loss of associates is included in other comprehensive income or loss.\nUnrealized gains on transactions between the Company and an associate are eliminated to the extent of the Company’s\ninterest in the associate. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an\nimpairment of the asset transferred. Dilution gains and losses arising from changes in interests in investments in\nassociates are recognized in the consolidated statement of loss.\nThe Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that its investments in\nassociates are impaired. If impaired, the carrying value of the Company’s share of the underlying assets of associates\nis written down to its estimated recoverable amount (being the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-\nuse) and charged to the consolidated statement of income or loss.\nk) Property, plant and equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost\nincludes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset. Subsequent costs are included in the\nasset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic\nbenefit associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount\nof a replaced asset is derecognized when replaced.\nDepreciation is calculated to amortize the cost of the property and equipment less their residual values over their\nestimated useful lives using the straight-line method over the following periods by major categories:\nLeasehold improvements Lease term\nFurniture and office equipment 2 7 years\nExploration equipment and facilities 2 20 years\nMining plant and equipment (development) 3‑20 years\nRight-of-use assets Le‑sser of useful life and term lease\n‑\nResidual values, method of depreciation and useful lives of the assets are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.\n14\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nGains and losses on disposals of property and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying\namount of the asset and are included as part of other gains or losses, net in the consolidated statement of loss.\nl) Mining interests\nDevelopment assets are interests in projects that are under development, in permitting or feasibility stage and that in\nmanagement’s view, can be reasonably expected to generate steady-state revenue for the Company in the near future.\nSubsequent to completion of a positive economic analysis on a mineral property, capitalized exploration and evaluation\nassets are transferred into mining interests, or as an item of property and equipment, based on the nature of the\nunderlying asset.\nMining interests are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes\nexpenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset, including the purchase price and all expenditures\nundertaken in the development, construction, installation and/or completion of mine production facilities. All\nexpenditures related to the construction of mine declines and orebody access, including mine shafts and ventilation\nraises, are considered to be capital development and are capitalized. The development and commissioning phase\nceases upon the commencement of commercial production.\nSubsequent to the commencement of commercial production, further development expenditures incurred with respect\nto a mining interest are capitalized as part of the mining interest, when it is probable that additional future economic\nbenefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company. Otherwise, such expenditures are classified as other\noperating costs. Mining interest assets are subject to periodic review for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the project’s carrying value may not be recoverable.\nUpon commencement of commercial production, mining interests are depleted over the life of the mine using the unit-\nof production method based on the economic life of the related deposit.\nDetermination of commencement of commercial production is a complex process and requires significant assumptions\nand estimates. The commencement of commercial production is defined as the date when the mine is capable of\noperating in the manner intended by management. The Company considers primarily the following factors, among\nothers, when determining the commencement of commercial production:\n• All major capital expenditures to achieve a consistent level of production and desired capacity have been\nincurred;\n• A reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment has been completed;\n• A predetermined percentage of design capacity of the mine and mill has been reached; and\n• Required production levels, grades and recoveries have been achieved.\nm) Exploration and evaluation expenditures\nExploration and evaluation assets are comprised of exploration and evaluation expenditures and acquisition costs for\nexploration and evaluation assets. Expenditures incurred on activities that precede exploration and evaluation, being\nall expenditures incurred prior to securing the legal rights to explore an area, are expensed immediately. Exploration\nand evaluation assets include rights in mining properties, paid or acquired through a business combination or an\nacquisition of assets, and costs related to the initial search for mineral deposits with economic potential or to obtain\nmore information about existing mineral deposits. Mining rights are recorded at acquisition cost less accumulated\nimpairment losses. Mining rights and options to acquire undivided interests in mining rights are depreciated only as\nthese properties are put into commercial production.\n15\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nExploration and evaluation expenditures for each separate area of interest are capitalized and include costs associated\nwith prospecting, sampling, trenching, drilling and other work involved in searching for ore like topographical, geological,\ngeochemical and geophysical studies. They also reflect costs related to establishing the technical and commercial\nviability of extracting a mineral resource identified through exploration and evaluation or acquired through a business\ncombination or asset acquisition.\nExploration and evaluation expenditures include the cost of:\n(i) establishing the volume and grade of deposits through drilling of core samples, trenching and sampling\nactivities;\n(ii) determining the optimal methods of extraction and metallurgical and treatment processes;\n(iii) studies related to surveying, transportation and infrastructure requirements;\n(iv) permitting activities; and\n(v) economic evaluations to determine whether development of the mineralized material is commercially justified,\nincluding scoping, prefeasibility and final feasibility studies.\nExploration and evaluation expenditures include overhead expenses directly attributable to the related activities.\nExploration and evaluation assets are subject to periodic review for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the project’s carrying value may not be recoverable.\nCash flows attributable to capitalized exploration and evaluation costs are classified as investing activities in the\nconsolidated statement of cash flows under the heading exploration and evaluation.\nn) Provision for environmental rehabilitation\nProvision for environmental rehabilitation, restructuring costs and legal claims, where applicable, is recognized when:\n(i) The Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events.\n(ii) It is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.\n(iii) The amount can be reliably estimated.\nThe provision is measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the end\nof the reporting period and is discounted to present value where the effect is material. The increase in the provision due\nto passage of time is recognized as finance costs. Changes in assumptions or estimates are reflected in the period in\nwhich they occur. Provision for environmental rehabilitation represents the legal and constructive obligations associated\nwith the eventual closure of the Company’s property, plant and equipment. These obligations consist of costs associated\nwith reclamation and monitoring of activities and the removal of tangible assets. The discount rate used is based on a\npre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation,\nexcluding the risks for which future cash flow estimates have already been adjusted.\nReclamation deposits\nReclamation deposits are term deposits held on behalf of the government of the province of British Columbia as\ncollateral for possible rehabilitation activities on the Company’s mineral properties in connection with permits required\nfor exploration activities. It also includes the same nature deposit for Utah operations. Reclamation deposits are\nreleased once the property is restored to satisfactory condition, or as released under the surety bond agreement. As\nthey are restricted from general use, they are included under other assets on the consolidated statements of financial\nposition.\n16\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\no) Current and deferred income tax\nThe tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the consolidated statements\nof loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or loss or directly in\nequity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or loss or directly in equity, respectively.\nCurrent income taxes\nThe current income tax charge is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using the tax laws\nenacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date in the jurisdictions where the Company and\nits subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns\nwith respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where\nappropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\nDeferred income taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income\ntax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the\nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. However, the\ndeferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other\nthan a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates (and laws)\nthat apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available\nagainst which the temporary differences can be utilized.\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except\nwhere the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the\ntemporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented as non-current and are offset when there is a legally enforceable\nright to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income\ntaxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is\nan intention to settle the balances on a net basis.\np) Leases\nThe Company is committed to long-term lease agreements, mainly for office space and mining equipment.\nLeases are recognized as a right-of-use asset (presented under property, plant and equipment on the consolidated\nstatement of financial position) and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by\nthe Company. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to\nprofit or loss over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the\nliability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease\nterm on a straight-line basis.\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are\ndiscounted utilizing the implicit interest rate of the specific lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the\nCompany’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow the funds\nnecessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\nPayments associated with short-term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a\nstraight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.\n17\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nq) Share-based compensation\nShare option plan\nThe Company offers a share option plan to its directors, officers, employees and consultants. Each tranche in an award\nis considered a separate award with its own vesting period and grant date fair value. Fair value of each tranche is\nmeasured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation expense is recognized over\nthe tranche’s vesting period by increasing contributed surplus based on the number of awards expected to vest. The\nnumber of awards expected to vest is reviewed at least annually, with any impact being recognized immediately.\nAny consideration paid on exercise of share options is credited to share capital. The contributed surplus resulting from\nshare-based compensation is transferred to share capital when the options are exercised.\nDeferred and restricted share units\nThe Company offers a deferred share units (“DSU”) plan to its directors and a restricted share units (“RSU”) plan to its\nofficers and employees. DSU may be granted to directors and RSU may be granted to employees and officers as part\nof their respective long-term compensation package, entitling them to receive a payment in the form of common shares,\ncash (based on the Company’s share price at the relevant time) or a combination of common shares and cash, at the\nsole discretion of the Company. The fair value of the DSU and RSU granted to be settled in common shares is measured\non the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period under contributed surplus with a corresponding charge to\nshare-based compensation. A liability for the DSU and RSU to be settled in cash is measured at fair value on the grant\ndate and is subsequently adjusted at each statement of financial position date for changes in fair value. The liability is\nrecognized over the vesting period with a corresponding charge to share-based compensation.\nr) Revenue recognition\nRevenues generated from sale of metals is recognized when the Company satisfies the performance obligations\nassociated with the sale. Typically, this is accomplished when control over the metals are passed from the Company to\nthe buyer. Primary factors that indicate the point in time when control has passed to the buyer includes but is not limited\nto (a) the Company has transferred physical possession and legal title of the asset to the purchaser and (b) the\nCompany has present right to payment.\ns) Contract Liability\nThe advance payment received by the Company in consideration for future commitments as specified in its streaming\nagreements (the “Contract Liability”) has been accounted for as contract liability within the scope of IFRS 15 Revenue\nfrom Contracts with Customers. Under the terms of the agreement, performance obligations are satisfied through\nproduction at the San Antonio gold project and the Trixie test mine and revenue are recognized over the duration of the\ncontracts based on estimated gold and silver prices prevailing at contract initial recognition. Because of the difference\nbetween the timing of the delivery of gold and silver under the streaming agreements and the upfront amount of\nconsideration received, it has been determined that the streaming agreements contained a significant financing\ncomponent under IFRS 15. The significant financing component is accounted for separately from the revenue\ncomponent and accretion expense on the contract liability is recognized in finance costs. The interest rate is determined\nbased on the interest rate implicit in the streaming agreements at the date of inception. The initial consideration received\nfrom the streaming arrangement is considered variable, subject to changes in the total gold ounces to be delivered in\nthe future. Changes to variable consideration will be reflected in the statement of income (loss) and comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nIncremental costs directly attributable to obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalized as other non-current\nassets. Upon commencement of production, the other non-current assets will be expensed over the life of mine. Such\ncosts are subject to impairment when the remaining amount of consideration to be received exceeds the costs that\nrelate directly to providing the goods that have not been recognized as expenses.\n18\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nt) Net income (loss) per share\nThe calculation of net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nfor each period. The basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the equity owners of the\nCompany by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\nThe computation of diluted EPS assumes the conversion, exercise or contingent issuance of securities only when such\nconversion, exercise or issuance would have a dilutive effect on the income per share. The treasury stock method is\nused to determine the dilutive effect of the warrants, share options, DSU and RSU. When the Company reports a loss,\nthe diluted net loss per common share is equal to the basic net loss per common share due to the anti-dilutive effect of\nthe outstanding warrants, share options, DSU and RSU.\nu) Segment reporting\nThe operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Executive\nOfficer (“CEO”) who fulfills the role of the chief decision-maker. The CEO is responsible for allocating resources and\nassessing performance of the Company’s operating segments. The Company manages its business by the exploration,\nevaluation and development activities of its projects.\n4. New accounting standards and amendments\nMaterial accounting standards and amendments\nAmendments – IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting\nEstimates and Errors\nIn 2021, the IASB issued narrow-scope amendments to IFRS, including to IAS 1 and IAS 8. The amendments were\nmade to help companies improve accounting policy disclosures so that they provide more useful information to investors\nand other primary users of the financial statements; and distinguish changes in accounting estimates from changes in\naccounting policies.\nThe amendments to IAS 1 require companies to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their\nsignificant accounting policies. Accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other\ninformation included in an entity’s financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the\nprimary users of general-purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements. The\namendments to IAS 8 clarify how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in\naccounting estimates. That distinction is important because changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively\nonly to future transactions and other future events, but changes in accounting policies are generally also applied\nretrospectively to past transactions and other past events. The amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 are effective for annual\nreporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Although the amendments did not result in any changes to the\naccounting policies themselves, they impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Management reviewed the accounting policies and made updates to the information disclosed in Note 3,\nin certain instances, in line with the amendments.\nNew accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted\nThe Company has not yet adopted certain standards, interpretations to existing standards and amendments which have\nbeen issued but have an effective date of later than December 31, 2023. Some of these updates are not expected to\nhave any significant impact on the Company and are therefore not discussed herein.\nClassification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)\n19\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nThe IASB has published amendments to IAS 1 (Classification of liabilities as current or non-current and non-current\nliabilities with covenants) which clarify the guidance on whether a liability should be classifies as either current or non-\ncurrent. The amendments:\n• Clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should only be based on rights that are in\nplace “at the end of the reporting period”;\n• Clarify that classification is unaffected by intentions or expectations about whether an entity will exercise its\nright to defer settlement of a liability; and\n• Make clear that settlement includes transfers to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or\nservices that result in extinguishment of the liability.\nIn addition, the IASB confirmed that only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before the reporting date\naffect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. Covenants with which an entity must comply within twelve\nmonths of the reporting date (“Future Covenants”) do not affect a liability’s classification at the reporting date. However,\nwhen non-current liabilities are subject to Future Covenants, entities will need to disclose information in the notes that\nenables users of the consolidated financial statements to understand the risk that the liability could become repayable\nwithin twelve months of the reporting date.\nThe amendments to IAS 1 are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 and should be applied\nretrospectively in accordance with IAS 8. The adoption of the amendments to IAS 1 is expected to impact the\nclassification of the Warrant liability from non-current to current liability.\n5. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the Company to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\nat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nThe Company also makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The determination of estimates requires\nthe exercise of judgement based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience and current\nand expected economic conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nEstimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,\nincluding expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions\nMineral reserves and resources\nMineral reserves are estimates of the amount of minable ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the\nCompany’s mining properties. The Company estimates its mineral reserve and mineral resources based on information\ncompiled by Qualified Persons as defined by Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101, Standards\nfor Disclosure of Mineral Projects. Such information includes geological data on the size, depth and shape of the mineral\ndeposit, and requires complex geological judgments to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable reserves or\nresources is based upon factors such as estimates of commodity prices, future capital requirements, and production\ncosts along with geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade that comprise the mineral\nreserves or resources. Changes in the mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates may impact the carrying value of\nmineral properties and deferred development costs, property, plant and equipment, provision for site reclamation and\nclosure, recognition of deferred income tax assets and depreciation and amortization charges.\n20\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nImpairment of exploration and evaluation assets, mining interests and plant and equipment\nThe Company’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items being capitalized.\nThis policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances,\nin particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any such estimates and\nassumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalized the expenditure, a\njudgement is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalized amount will be written off to the\nconsolidated statement of loss.\nDevelopment activities commence after project sanctioning by senior management. Judgement is applied by\nmanagement in determining when a project has reached a stage at which economically recoverable reserves or\nresources exist such that development may be sanctioned. In exercising this judgement, management is required to\nmake certain estimates and assumptions similar to those described above for capitalized exploration and evaluation\nexpenditure. Such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having\nstarted the development activity, a judgement is made that a development asset is impaired, the appropriate amount\nwill be written off to the consolidated statement of loss.\nThe Company’s recoverability of its recorded value of its exploration and evaluation assets, mining interests and plant\nand equipment is based on market conditions for metals, underlying mineral resources associated with the properties\nand future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale.\nAt each reporting date, the Company evaluates each mining property and project on results to date to determine the\nnature of exploration, other assessment and development work that is warranted in the future. If there is little prospect\nof future work on a property or project being carried out within a prolonged period from completion of previous activities,\nthe deferred expenditures related to that property or project are written off or written down to the estimated amount\nrecoverable unless there is persuasive evidence that an impairment allowance is not required.\nThe recoverable amounts of exploration and evaluation assets, mining interests and plant and equipment are\ndetermined using the higher of value in use or fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use consists of the net present\nvalue of future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset in its current condition based on observable data. The\ncalculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management. These cash flow\nprojections are based on expected recoverable ore reserves or resources, grade per ounce, recovery rates, selling\nprices of metals and operating costs. Fair value less costs of disposal consist of the expected sale price (the amount\nthat a market participant would pay for the asset) of the asset net of transaction costs.\nThe Company may use other approaches in determining the fair value which may include estimates related to (i) dollar\nvalue per ounce of mineral reserve/resource; (ii) cash-flow multiples; (iii) market capitalization of comparable assets;\nand (iv) comparable sales transactions. Any changes in the quality and quantity of recoverable ore reserves, expected\nselling prices and operating costs could materially affect the estimated fair value of mining interests, which could result\nin material write-downs or write-offs in the future.\nThe recent market conditions, industry cost pressures, current inflationary environment and changes in assumptions\nrelated to required future capital expenditures, potential mining and processing methods and average processed gold\ngrades are considered as indicators of impairment, among other facts and circumstances and, accordingly,\nmanagement of Osisko Development performed an impairment assessment on all its projects. The Company tested its\nCash Generating Units (CGU), for impairment, and determined the recoverable amounts exceeded the carrying\namounts. The Company’s assessments reflected a number of significant management assumptions and estimates\nrelating to future cash flows projections and discount rate. Changes in these assumptions could impact the Company’s\nconclusion in future reporting (Note10).\n21\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nProvision for environmental rehabilitation\nProvision for environmental rehabilitation is based on management best estimates and assumptions, which\nmanagement believes are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability, based on the current economic\nenvironment. These estimates take into account any material changes to the assumptions that occur when reviewed\nregularly by management and are based on current regulatory requirements. Significant changes in estimates of\ndiscount rate, contamination, rehabilitation standards and techniques will result in changes to the provision from period\nto period. Actual reclamation and closure costs will ultimately depend on future market prices for the costs which will\nreflect the market condition at the time the costs are actually incurred. The final cost of the rehabilitation provision may\nbe higher or lower than currently provided for.\nAccounting for streaming arrangements\nThe Company entered into stream agreements (Note 17). The classification of the deposit as a contract liability is a key\njudgment and is based on the expected delivery of the Company’s future production. Management exercised judgment\nin applying the accounting standard IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. To determine the transaction\nprice for the stream agreement, the Company made estimates with respect to the estimated timing and value of future\ndeliveries in order to determine the interest implicit rate for each agreement.\nCritical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies\nGoing Concern\nThe assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern involves judgment as it relies on the company’s\nestimation of future cash flows for the 12-month period from the financial statement date, and the availability of funds\nto meet those cash flow requirements. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical\nexperience and other factors, including expectations of future events and budgeted expenditures (approved by the\nBoard) that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances (Note 1).\nBusiness combinations\nThe assessment of whether an acquisition meets the definition of a business, or whether assets are acquired is an area\nof key judgement. The assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed, and exploration and evaluation properties, generally requires a high degree of judgement. Changes\nin the judgements made could impact the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities.\nImpairment of investments in associates\nThe Company follows the guidance of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures to assess whether there\nare impairment indicators which may lead to the recognition of an impairment loss with respect to its net investment in\nan associate. This determination requires significant judgement in evaluating if a decline in fair value is significant or\nprolonged, which triggers a formal impairment test. In making this judgement, the Company’s management evaluates,\namong other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount,\nthe volatility of the investment and the financial health and business outlook for the investee, including factors such as\nthe current and expected status of the investee’s exploration projects and changes in financing cash flows.\nImpairment of exploration and evaluation assets\nAssessment of impairment of exploration and evaluation assets (including exploration and evaluation assets under a\nfarm-out agreement) requires the use of judgements when assessing whether there are any indicators that could give\nrise to the requirement to conduct a formal impairment test on the Company’s exploration and evaluation assets. Factors\nwhich could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, an expiry of the right to explore in the specific\n22\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\narea during the period or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed; substantive exploration and\nevaluation expenditures in a specific area is neither budgeted nor planned; exploration for and evaluation of mineral\nresources in a specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and\nthe Company has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; sufficient data exists to indicate that,\nalthough a development in a specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the assets is unlikely to be\nrecovered in full from successful development or by sale; significant negative industry or economic trends; interruptions\nin exploration and evaluation activities by the Company; and a significant change in current or forecast commodity\nprices. As at December 31, 2023, no impairment indicators were identified and, as such, no impairment test was\nperformed.\nChanges in the judgements used in determining the fair value of the exploration and evaluation assets could impact the\nimpairment analysis.\nTaxes recoverable\nThe Company incurs significant expenditures on which sales and indirect taxes (Canada and USA) and value-added\ntaxes (Mexico) is paid. The Company can claim a 100% refund of taxes paid on allowable expenditure.\nAs a result of the Company’s limited operating history, management currently estimates 100% collectability of the taxes\nreceivable balances and anticipates the collection within 12 months in Canada and USA, and 36 months in Mexico of\nincurring the associated expenditure once the Company begins with the refund process. It is possible however, that\nthe refund requests may be delayed, reduced or denied by the respective taxation authorities. Management assesses\ncollectability and classification of the asset at each reporting period.\n6. Cash and cash equivalents\nAs at December 31, 2023 and December 31 2022, the consolidated cash and cash equivalents position was as follows:\n2023 2022\n$ $\nCash and cash equivalents held in Canadian dollars 16,857 32,444\nCash and cash equivalents held in U.S. dollars 20,110 54,242\nCash and cash equivalents held in U.S. dollars (Canadian equivalent) 26,597 73,465\nCash held and cash equivalents in Mexican Pesos 16 565\nCash held and cash equivalents in Mexican Pesos (Canadian equivalent) 1 35\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 43,455 105,944\nAs at December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents include US$1.0 million ($1.4 million) held in money market funds\n(2022 – nil).\n23\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\n7.

The security shall be first ranking, subject to permitted encumbrances.\nImpairment assessment\nThe recent market conditions, industry cost pressures, current inflationary environment and changes in assumptions\nrelated to required future capital expenditures, potential mining and processing methods and decrease in contained\ngold ounces in measured, indicated and inferred resources are considered as indicators of impairment and, accordingly,\nmanagement of the Company performed an impairment assessment on all its projects. The Company tested its CGUs,\nfor impairment, and recorded impairment charges in 2023 and 2022 based on the results of its impairment assessments.\nThe Company’s assessments reflected a number of significant management assumptions and estimates relating to\nfuture cash flows projections and discount rate. Changes in these assumptions could impact the Company’s conclusion\nin future reporting.\nOn December 31, 2023, an impairment charge of $160.5 million on the Trixie test mine was recorded and the net assets\nof the Trixie test mine were written down to their net estimated recoverable amount (including mining interest and\nproperty, plant and equipment) of $51.6 million which was determined using a fair value less costs of disposal model\nbased on a discounted cash flows approach. The impairment charge was recorded against the Mining Interests. The\nmain valuation inputs used were the cash flows expected to be generated by the production and sale of gold and silver\nfrom the Trixie gold mine over the estimated life of the mine, the expected long-term gold price per ounce and a discount\nrate of 10.4% applied to the cash flow projections. A sensitivity analysis was performed by Osisko Development’s\nmanagement for the long-term gold price and the expected contained ounces of gold in the measured, indicated and\ninferred resources, using reasonably possible changes to these key assumptions. If the long-term gold price per ounce\n26\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\napplied to the cash flow projections had been 10% lower than management’s estimates, Osisko Development would\nhave recognized an additional impairment charge of $18.2 million. If the expected number of countained ounces of gold\napplied to the cash flow projections had been 10% lower than management’s estimates, Osisko Development would\nhave recognized an additional impairment charge of $9.1 million.\nOn December 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $59.0 million on the Cariboo gold project was recorded and the net\nassets of the Cariboo gold project were written down to its net estimated recoverable amount (including mining interest\nand property, plant and equipment) of $435.7 million which was determined by the value-in-use using a discounted\ncash-flows approach and reflected as an impairment of Mining Interests. The main valuation inputs used were the cash\nflows expected to be generated by the production and sale of gold from the Cariboo gold project over the estimated life\nof the mine, based on the expected longterm gold price per ounce costs inflation forecast and the discount rate of 12.6%\napplied to the cash flow projections. A sensitivity analysis was performed by management of Osisko Development for\nthe long-term gold price and the discount rate, using reasonably possible changes to these key assumptions. If the\nlong-term gold price per ounce applied to the cash flow projections had been 10% lower than management’s estimates,\nOsisko Development would have recognized an additional impairment charge of $193.0 million. If the discount rate\napplied to the cash flow projections had been 100 basis points higher than management’s estimates, Osisko\nDevelopment would have recognized an additional impairment charge of $55.7 million. Based on the estimated\nrecoverable amounts which were determined by the value-in-use using a discounted cash-flows approach and, with a\nsensitivity analysis performed, management concluded that there was no impairment in the carrying value of the Cariboo\ngold project as at December 31, 2023.\nOn September 30, 2022, an impairment charge of $81.0 million on the San Antonio gold project was recorded and the\nnet assets of the San Antonio gold project were written down to its net estimated recoverable amount (including mining\ninterest and property, plant and equipment) of $35.0 million which was determined by the value-in-use using a\ndiscounted cash-flows approach and reflected as an impairment of Mining Interests. The main valuation inputs used\nwere the cash flows expected to be generated by the production and sale of gold from the San Antonio gold project\nover the estimated life of the mine, based on the expected long-term gold price per ounce costs inflation forecast and\nthe discount rate of 19.9% applied to the cash flow projections. A sensitivity analysis was performed by management\nof Osisko Development for the long-term gold price and the discount rate, using reasonably possible changes to these\nkey assumptions. If the long-term gold price per ounce applied to the cash flow projections had been 10% lower than\nmanagement’s estimates, Osisko Development would have recognized an additional impairment charge of $35.0\nmillion. If the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections had been 100 basis points higher than management’s\nestimates, Osisko Development would have recognized an additional impairment charge of $5.8 million. Based on the\nestimated recoverable amounts which were determined by the value-in-use using a discounted cash-flows approach\nand, with a sensitivity analysis performed, management concluded that there was no impairment in the carrying value\nof the San Antonio gold project as at December 31, 2023.\nAcquisition of Tintic Consolidated Metals LLC\nOn May 27, 2022, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Tintic Consolidated Metals LLC,\nwhich owns the producing Trixie test mine, as well as mineral claims in central Utah’s historic Tintic Mining District (the\n“Tintic Transaction”).\nUnder the terms of the Tintic Transaction, the Company funded the acquisition through:\n(i) the issuance of 12,049,449 common shares of Osisko Development;\n(ii) aggregate cash payments of approximately US$58.7 million ($74.7million)\n(iii) the issuance of an aggregate of 2% NSR royalties, with a 50% buyback right in favour of Osisko\nDevelopment exercisable within five years;\n(iv) US$12.5 million in deferred payments ($15.9 million); and\n27\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\n(v) the granting of certain other contingent payments, rights and obligations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, transaction costs related to the acquisition were expensed under general\nand administrative expenses and amounted to approximately $6.4 million for the year. The total consideration paid\namounted to approximately US$156.6 million ($199.5 million). In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, a\nbusiness combination is a transaction in which an acquirer obtains control of a business which is defined as an\nintegrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed to provide a return to investors.\nFor an integrated set of activities and assets to be considered a business, the set needs to contain inputs, and\nprocesses.

Each Brokered Unit is\ncomprised of one common share and one warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one additional\ncommon share at a price of $22.80 ($7.60 pre-share consolidation) per common share for a period of 5 years following\nthe closing date of the Brokered Private Placement. On May 30, 2022, Brokered Subscription Receipt holders received\none Brokered Unit for each Brokered Subscription Receipt, upon the Company satisfying all conditions precedent to the\nTintic acquisition (the “Brokered Escrow Release Condition”). Total common share and warrants issued under the\nBrokered Private Placement on a post share consolidation basis amount each to 7,752,917. Issuance costs related to\nthe Brokered Units issued amounted to $3.5 million and have been allocated against the common shares and warrants\nissued. The fair value of the warrants issued was evaluated using the residual method and were valued at $1.6 million,\nnet of issuance costs.\n2022 Non-Brokered private placements\nThe Company completed three tranches of a non-brokered private placement, issuing non-brokered subscription\nreceipts at a price of US$3.50 (“Non-Brokered Subscription Receipts”) (i) the first tranche closed on March 4, 2022\nissuing 24,215,099 Non-Brokered Subscription Receipts for gross proceeds of US$84.8 million (CA$108 million) (ii) the\nsecond tranche closing on March 29, 2022 issuing 9,365,689 Non-Brokered Subscription Receipts for gross proceeds\nof US$32.8 million (CA$41.8 million), and (iii) the third tranche closing on April 21, 2022 issuing 512,980 Non-Brokered\nSubscription Receipts for gross proceeds of US$1.8 million (CA$2.3 million) (collectively, the “Non-Brokered Private\nPlacement”), on a pre-share consolidation basis.\nOn May 27, 2022, each Non-Brokered Subscription Receipt holder received one Unit, upon the listing of Osisko\nDevelopment’s common shares on the NYSE (the “Non-Brokered Escrow Release Condition”). Each Unit is\ncomprised of one common share and one common share purchase warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to\npurchase one additional common share at a price of USD$18.00 (USD$6.00 pre-share consolidation) per common\nshare for a period of 5 years from the date of issue (“Unit”). Total common share and warrants issued under the Non-\nBrokered Private Placement on a post share consolidation basis amount each to 11,363,933.\nThese warrants include an embedded derivative as they are exercisable in U.S. dollars and, therefore, fail the “fixed for\nfixed” requirements prescribed in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: presentation. As a result, they are classified as a liability\nand measured at fair value. Their value was estimated at $39.8 million on the issue date using the Black-Scholes model\nand they are presented as a non-current liability on the consolidated statement of financial position. The liability is\nrevalued at its estimated fair value using the Black-Scholes model at the end of each reporting period, and the variation\nin the fair value is recognized on the consolidated statements of loss (Note 19). All securities issued under the Non-\nbrokered Private Placement were subject to a hold period expiring four months and one day from the closing date.\nIssuance costs allocated to common shares amounted to $2.8 million.

Financial risks\nThe Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks (including interest rate risk, foreign\ncurrency risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk management program\nfocuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Company’s\nperformance.\nRisk management is carried out under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors provides\nprinciples for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk,\ninterest rate risk, and credit risk, the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments,\nand investment in excess liquidities.\n(a) Market risks\n(i) Interest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of\nchanges in market interest rates.\nThe Company’s interest rate risk on financial assets is primarily related to cash, which bear interest at variable rates.\nHowever, as these investments come to maturity within a short period of time, the impact would likely be not significant.\nFinancial liabilities are not exposed to interest rate risk since they are non interest-bearing liabilities or bear interest at\na fixed rate.\n(ii) Foreign exchange risk\nThe Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency volatility, primarily with respect to the US dollar.\nThe Company holds balances in cash denominated in U.S. dollars and is therefore exposed to gains or losses on foreign\nexchange.\nAs at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balances in U.S. dollars held by entities with a different functional currency\nwere as follows:\n2023 2022\n$ $\nCash 20,110 54,242\nAccounts receivable 1,724 921\nAccounts payable 3,413 (7,425)\nNet exposure, in US dollars 25,248 47,738\nNet exposure, equivalent in Canadian dollars 33,392 64,656\nBased on the balances as at December 31, 2023, a 5% fluctuation in the exchange rates on that date (with all other\nvariables being constant) would have resulted in a variation of net loss of approximately $1.7 million in 2023 ($1.7\nmillion, net of taxes).\n44\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\n(iii) Commodity price risk\nThe price of gold has a significant influence on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMovements in the spot price of gold have a direct impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, as refined\nprecious metals are sold at prevailing market prices. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized\n$31.6 million in sales of refined precious metals. The Company will continue to monitor the level of sales and when\nprudent will adopt measures to mitigate its price exposure.\n(iv) Other price risk\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk as a result of holding long-term investments in other exploration and\ndevelopment mining companies. The equity prices of long-term investments are impacted by various underlying factors\nincluding commodity prices. Based on the Company's long-term investments held as at December 31, 2023, a 10%\nincrease (decrease) in the equity prices of these investments would decrease (increase) the net loss by not a significant\namount and the other comprehensive income (loss) by $2.2 million.\n(b) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge its obligation and cause the other party\nto incur a financial loss. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash,\namounts receivable and reclamation deposits. The Company reduces its credit risk by investing its cash in high interest\nsavings accounts with Canadian regulated financial institutions and its reclamation deposits in guaranteed investments\ncertificates issued by Canadian chartered banks.\nThe maximum credit exposure of the Company corresponds to the respective instrument’s carrying amount.\n(c) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet the obligations associated with its financial liabilities.\nThe Company manages the liquidity risk by continuously monitoring actual and projected cash flows, taking into account\nthe requirements related to its investment commitments, mining properties and exploration and evaluation assets and\nmatching the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities. The Board of Directors of the Company reviews and\napproves any material transaction out of the ordinary course of business, including proposals on mergers, acquisitions\nor other major investment or divestitures.

The quoted market price used for financial assets held\nby the Company is the last transaction price. Instruments included in Level 1 consist primarily of common shares trading\non recognized securities exchanges, such as the TSX or the TSX Venture.\nFinancial instruments in Level 2\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation\ntechniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as\nlittle as possible on the Company’ specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to measure the fair value of an\ninstrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs are not based\non observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\nFinancial instruments in Level 3\nFinancial instruments classified in Level 3 include investments in private companies and warrants held by the Company\nthat are not traded on a recognized securities exchange. At each statement of financial position date, the fair value of\ninvestments held in private companies is evaluated using a discounted cash-flows approach. The main valuation inputs\nused in the cashflows models being significant unobservable inputs, these investments are classified in Level 3. The\nfair value of the investments in warrants is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which includes\nsignificant inputs not based on observable market data. Therefore, investments in warrants are included in Level 3\nThe following table presents the changes in the Level 3 investments (warrants and convertible loan) for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\n$ $\nBalance – Beginning of year 18 6,952\nAcquisitions — 4,438\nWarrants exercised — (117)\nAcquisition of Tintic — (10,827)\nChange in fair value – warrants exercised (i) (14) 49\nChange in fair value – expired (i) — (287)\nChange in fair value – held at the end of the year (i) — (241)\nForeign exchange — 51\nBalance – End of year 4 18\n(i) Recognized in the consolidated statements of loss under other income, net.\nThe fair value of the financial instruments classified as Level 3 depends on the nature of the financial instruments.\nThe fair value of the warrants on equity securities of publicly traded mining exploration and development companies\nand the convertible debentures, classified as Level 3, is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model or\ndiscounted cash flows. The main non-observable input used in the model is the expected volatility. An\nincrease/decrease in the expected volatility used in the models of 10% would lead to an insignificant variation in the fair\nvalue of the warrants as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n47\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nFinancial instruments not measured at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial position\nFinancial instruments that are not measured at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position are\nrepresented by cash and cash equivalents, reclamation deposits, trade receivables, interest income receivable,\namounts receivable from associates and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long-term debt.\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, amounts receivable from associates and other\nreceivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and short-term debt approximate their carrying values due to their\nshort-term nature. The carrying value of the reclamation deposits and long-term debt approximates their fair value given\nthat their interest rates are similar to the rates the Company would obtain under similar conditions at the reporting date.\n31. Related party transactions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred expenses of $1.1 million ($2.6 million in 2022) for\nadministrative, legal and technical expenses charged from associates, primarily reflected in the consolidated statement\nof loss. As of December 31, 2023, amounts receivable from associates amounted to $0.1 million ($0.2 million in 2022)\nand amounts payable to associates totalled $0.1 million ($0.4 million in 2022).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company contributed a donation of $0.5 million (nil in 2023) to\nBarkerville Heritage Trust, of which an officer of Osisko Development holds a position on the board of directors.\nOn December 31, 2023, the former parent Company, OGR held an interest of 39.7% (compared to 44.1% as at\nDecember 31, 2022) in Osisko Development Corp.\n32.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nThis MD&A contains certain non-IFRS (as defined herein) measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" (or \"AISC\") and \"cash\ncost\". All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative,\nexploration, other expenses and sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS\nmeasure reported by the Company on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general\nand administration costs and royalties but excludes depreciation, reclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs\nfor the life of the mine. Management believes that such measures provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the\nperformance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and,\ntherefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide\nadditional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in\naccordance with IFRS, such as Cost of sales.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the statements of historical fact contained herein, the information presented in this MD&A constitutes \"forward-\nlooking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian Securities Laws concerning the business, operations, plans\nand financial performance and condition of the Company (collectively, the \"Forward-Looking Information\").

As such, the information contained in this MD&A concerning mineral\nproperties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information\nmade public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\n1. OUR BUSINESS\nOsisko Development is a Canadian-based exploration and development company focused on past-producing properties\nlocated in mining friendly jurisdictions with district scale potential. The Company's objective is to become a North American\nintermediate producer of precious metals, through curating and advancing a portfolio of development projects and\ninvestments with potential for value creation. The principal mining assets wholly owned through subsidiaries of the Company\nas of December 31, 2023, are as follows:\n Cariboo Gold Project (Permitting – British Columbia, Canada) (the \"Cariboo Gold Project\"), owned and operated\nby Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd. (\"Barkerville\").\n Tintic Project (including, the Trixie test mine located within the Company's wider Tintic Project) (Test mining and\nexploration – Utah, United States) (the \"Tintic Project\"), owned and operated by Tintic Consolidated Metals LLC\n(\"Tintic\").\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Project, which includes\nexploring the potential for a financial or strategic partner in the asset or for a full or partial sale of the asset. The\nCompany has engaged a financial advisor in connection with such strategic review.\n3\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nAs an exploration and development stage corporation, the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows to advance the\nevaluation and development of its various projects and properties and has historically relied on equity and debt funding to\nmaintain financial liquidity. Continued adequate financial liquidity is dependent on management's ability to secure additional\nfinancings in the future; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financings\nin the future, or at terms favourable to the Company (refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\").\nThe accompanied consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable\nto a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business\nas they come due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, Management takes into account all\navailable information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve months from the end of the reporting period.\nThe working capital position as at December 31, 2023, will not be sufficient to meet the Company's obligations, commitments\nand forecasted expenditures up to the period ending December 31, 2024. Management is aware, in making its assessment,\nof material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon the Company's ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and accordingly, the appropriateness of the use of accounting principles applicable to a going\nconcern.\n2.

In Q4 2023, the decrease in revenues\ncompared to Q4 2022 is mainly attributable to the decrease of revenue from Bonanza Ledge II and the reduction of\nsales from the Tintic Project and the San Antonio Project, both projects in care and maintenance during Q4 2023.\nThe higher operating loss in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 is primarily due to the partial impairment of the Trixie\nProject for an amount of $160.5 million compared to the prior year quarter impairment of the Cariboo Gold Project\namounting to $59 million.\n In Q4 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $138.1 million compared to a net loss of $64.9 million in Q4 2022.\nThe decrease in net loss is primarily due to the reasons noted above.\n5\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\n The net cash flows used in operating activities in Q4 2023 amounted to $10.1 million compared to $11.3 million in\nQ4 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the general operating activities at the Trixie Project and\nthe San Antonio Project, including the impact on each’s respective working capital.\n Investments in mining interests, property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation expenses for Q4\n2023 amounted to $14.8 million compared to $31.7 million in Q4 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction\nin mining development activities including the decrease in exploration spending at the Cariboo Gold Project. The\nlevel of expenditures at the Cariboo Gold Project also decreased following the finalization and publication of the\nfeasibility study for the Cariboo Gold Project in January 2023.\n Net cash outflows from financing activities amounted to $1.0 million in Q4 2023 compared to a cash inflow of $7.3\nmillion in Q4 2022.The decrease is primarily explained by the higher level of mining equipment financing in Q4 2022\namounting to $9.0 million compared to $0.8 million in 2023.\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n During the twelve months of 2023, the Company generated revenues of $31.6 million and incurred an operating\nloss of $209.4 million compared to $64 million and $234.3 million in 2022, respectively. The decrease in revenues\nis primarily due to the reduction of activities at the Bonanza Ledge II and the care and maintenance status in 2023\nfor the Tintic Project and the San Antonio Project. The decrease in activities impacted the cost of sales and other\noperating expenses, having a favorable impact on the operating loss.\n During the twelve months, the Company incurred a net loss of $181.9 million compared to a net loss of $192.5\nmillion in 2022. The net loss decrease is primarily due to the reasons noted, offset by an income tax recovery of\n$22.5 million, mainly related to the reversal of the deferred incomes taxes liability due to the decrease in the carrying\namount of the Tintic Project following the impairment charge recorded in Q4 2023. In addition, the change in fair\nvalue of warrant liability was $4.5 million for the twelve months in 2023, compared to $25.0 million in 2022.\n The net cash flows used in operating activities in 2023 amounted to $43.8 million compared to $50.3 million in 2022.\nThe decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the operating activities at the Bonanza Ledge II and the Tintic and\nSapuchi Projects.\n Investments in mining interests, property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation expenses in 2023\namounted to $72.3 million compared to $153.7 million, including the acquisition of Tintic, in 2022. The decrease in\ncash used in investing activities compared to 2022 is primarily due to the acquisition of Tintic on May 27, 2022 and\nthe commencement in July 2022 of the Brandy Lee decline at Tintic.\n Net cash inflows from financing activities amounted to $47.8 million in 2023 compared to a cash inflow of $254.5\nmillion in 2022. In 2022, to partially finance the acquisition of Tintic, the Company raised and closed $255.5 million\nin brokered and non-brokered private placement financings (refer to Financings) compared to proceeds of $51.8\nmillion from a bought deal financing in 2023.\n Cash position of $43.5 million as at December 31, 2023 compared to $105.9 million as at December 31, 2022.\n Based on current projections, the Company believes that the working capital position as at December 31, 2023 will\nnot be sufficient to meet the Company’s obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures up to the year\nending December 31, 2024. Management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to\nevents and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon the Company's ability to continue as a going concern\nas described in Note 1 to the 2023 annual audited consolidated financial statements. The Company’s ability to\ncontinue future operations and fund its planned activities is dependent on Management’s ability to secure additional\nfinancing in the future, which may be completed in several ways including, but not limited to, a combination of selling\nadditional investments from its portfolio, project debt finance, offtake or royalty financing and other capital market\n6\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nalternatives. Failure to secure future financing may impact and/or curtail the planned activities for the Company,\nwhich may include, but are not limited to, the suspension of certain development activities and the disposal of certain\ninvestments to generate liquidity. The Company is exploring options to secure additional financing. While\nManagement has been successful in securing financing in the past, there can be no assurance that it will be able\nto do so in the future or that these sources of funding or initiatives will be available to the Company or that they will\nbe available on terms which are acceptable to the Company.\nExploration Activities\n On October 11, 2023, the Company announced underground infill and exploration diamond drilling results as part\nof its 2023 exploration program at Trixie. In early October 2023, the Company also commenced drilling of the Trixie\nWest high-priority copper-gold-molybdenum potential porphyry target from underground at Trixie.\n On December 6, 2023, the Company announced the commencement of an initial surface diamond drilling\nexploration campaign to test copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry mineralization potential at the Tintic Project.\n On December 21, 2023, the Company announced underground drilling and chip sampling results from new\ndevelopment areas as part of its 2023 exploration program at Trixie.\nOther\n On November 15, 2023, the Company and O3 Mining Inc. (\"O3 Mining\") announced the successful formation and\ncapitalization of \"Electric Elements Mining Corp.\" (\"Electric Elements\") to explore for lithium potential on certain\nJames Bay properties in Eeyou Istchee Area, Nunavik, Québec transferred to Electric Elements by Osisko\nDevelopment and O3 Mining (the \"Spinout Transaction\"). Pursuant to the Spin-out Transaction, Electric Elements\nacquired from (i) Osisko Development, all of its shares and partnership units in certain subsidiaries holding the\nrights and title to and interest in its James Bay properties, in exchange for the issuance by Electric Elements to\nOsisko Development of 9,599,999 common shares of Electric Elements (\"EEM Shares\"); and (ii) O3 Mining, all of\nits rights and title to and interest in its Éléonore Opinaca property, in exchange for 2,400,000 EEM Shares (the\n\"Transfer\"). Subsequent to the Transfer, Electric Elements completed an equity financing of 8,217,405 EEM Shares\nat a price of C$0.50 per EEM Share for aggregate gross proceeds to Electric Elements of $4.1 million (the\n\"Financing\"). Proceeds of the Financing will be used by Electric Elements to fund the first phase of exploration\nactivities on its newly-acquired James Bay properties and for general corporate purposes. After giving effect to the\nFinancing, Osisko Development holds approximately 47% of the outstanding EEM Shares.\n On December 28, 2023, the Company announced that Luc Lessard, Chief Operating Officer (\"COO\") would retire\nfrom the Company at the end of 2023 to pursue other personal and professional commitments. Éric Tremblay, a\nDirector on the Board of Directors and Chair of the Environmental, Health and Sustainability Committee, has taken\non the position of interim COO.

See\n\"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\".\n6.1. Cariboo Gold Project – British Columbia, Canada\nThe Cariboo Gold Project is an advanced stage gold exploration project 100%-owned by the Company located in the historic\nWells-Barkerville mining camp, in the District of Wells, central British Columbia, Canada, that extends for approximately 77\nkilometres from northwest to southeast. The Company's total land package consists of 415 mineral titles and covers an area\nof approximately 155,000 hectares. On November 21, 2019, OGR acquired the Cariboo Gold Project through the acquisition\nof Barkerville. The project was part of the OGR contributed assets that created the Company on November 25, 2020.\nTechnical reports and mineral resource estimate\nThe Company completed a Feasibility Study (\"FS\") for the Cariboo Gold Project with an effective date of January 12, 2023.\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by the\ntechnical report filed in respect of the FS on the Cariboo Gold Project titled \"Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project,\nDistrict of Well, British Columbia, Canada\", dated January 10, 2023 (as amended January 12, 2023) with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022 (the \"Cariboo FS\"), which was prepared for the Company by Colin Hardie, P.

Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have\ndemonstrated economic viability.\n2. The Mineral Resource Estimate conforms to the 2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves\nand follows the 2019 CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines.\n3. A total of 481 vein zones were modelled for the Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley), Island Mountain (Shaft and Mosquito),\nBarkerville Mountain (BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee) deposits and one gold zone for Bonanza Ledge. A minimum true\nthickness of 2.0 m was applied, using the Au gold grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when\nnot assayed.\n4. The estimate is reported for a potential underground scenario at a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au, except for Bonanza Ledge\nat a cut- off grade of 3.5 g/t Au. The cut-off grade for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee deposits\nwas calculated using a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $54.32/t;\na processing and transport cost of $22.29/t;a G&A plus Environmental cost of $15.31/t; and a sustaining CAPEX cost of\n$31.19/t. The cut-off grade for the Bonanza Ledge deposit was calculated using a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD\nexchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $79.13/t; a processing and transport cost of $65.00/t; and a G&A plus\nEnvironmental cost of $51.65/t. The cut-off grades should be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing market conditions\n(metal prices, exchange rate, mining cost, etc.).\n5. Bulk density varies from 2.69 g/ cm3 to 3.20 g/ cm3.\n6. A four-step capping procedure was applied to composited data. Restricted search ellipsoids ranged from 7 to 50 g/t Au\nat four different distances ranging from 25 m to 250 m. High-grades at Bonanza Ledge were capped at 70 g/t Au on 2.0\nm composited data.\n11\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\n7. The gold Mineral Resources for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee vein zones were estimated\nusing Datamine StudioTM RM 1.9 software using hard boundaries on composited assays. The silver Mineral Resources\nand the dilution halo gold mineralization were estimated using Datamine StudioTM RM Pro 1.11. The OK method was\nused. Mineral Resources for Bonanza Ledge were estimated using GEOVIA GEMSTM 6.7 software using hard\nboundaries on composited assays. The OK method was used to interpolate a block model.\n8. Results are presented in situ. Calculations used metric units (meters, tonnes, g/t). Any discrepancies in the totals are\ndue to rounding effects.\nMineral Reserves Estimate\nProbable Mineral Reserves of 16.7 Mt grading 3.78 g/t Au for 2.03 Moz of contained gold in underground deposits, as\ndefined below, have an effective date of December 6, 2022 and form the basis of the Cariboo FS. Only Mineral Resources\nthat were classified as Measured and Indicated were given economic attributes in the mine design and when demonstrating\neconomic viability were classified as Mineral Reserves, incorporating an external mining dilution factor of 8% into the Mineral\nReserves estimate.\nTable 6: Cariboo Mineral Reserves Statement – December 6, 2022\nTonnes Gold Grade Contained Gold Silver Grade Contained\nClassification / Deposit (000's) (g/t) (000's oz) (g/t) Silver (oz)\nProven — — — — —\nProbable\nCow 4,127 3.41 453 0.08 11,018\nValley 3,445 3.70 410 0.14 15,059\nShaft 7,962 3.87 990 0.02 4,473\nMosquito 603 4.93 95 0.03 619\nLowhee 567 4.56 83 0.21 3,786\nTotal Proven and Probable Reserves 16,703 3.78 2,031 0.07 34,955\nNotes:\n1. Totals may not add up due to rounding.\n2. Mineral Reserves have been estimated in accordance with CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral\nReserves (2014), which are incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.\n3. Mineral Reserves used the following assumptions: US$1,700/oz gold price, USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27, and\nvariable cut- off value from 1.70 g/t to 4.00 g/t Au\n4. Mineral Reserves include both internal and external dilution along with mining recovery. The external dilution is\nestimated to be 8%. The average mining recovery factor was set at 93.6% to account for ore left in each block in the\nmargins of the deposit.\nThe mineral resource estimate is built upon over 650,000 meters of core from the 2015 to 2021 drill campaigns, and\nhistorically verified drill data using a total of 3,550 drill holes. A strong understanding of the controls of mineralization enabled\nOsisko Development's technical team to construct a mineral resource estimate constrained by lithology, alteration, structure\nand mineralization.\nOn December 31, 2022, the Cariboo gold project was written down to its net estimated recoverable amount of $435.7 million\nwhich was determined by the value-in-use using a discounted cash-flow approach and reflected as an impairment of Mining\nInterests. The main valuation inputs used were the cash flows expected to be generated by the production and sale of gold\nfrom the Cariboo gold project over the estimated life of the mine, based on the expected long-term gold price per ounce\ncosts inflation forecast and the discount rate of 12.6% applied to the cash flow projections.\n12\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nPermitting and EA Process\nOsisko Development started the EA Process in the spring of 2019 for the Cariboo Gold Project.\nOn October 27, 2021, the Province of British Columbia, Lhtako Dené First Nation and the Company announced the approval\nof amendments to Mines Act Permits M-238 and M-198 allowing for the expansion of the existing Bonanza Ledge II\nunderground mine. At the time, these amendments supported the employment of additional workers at the mine. The\nexpansion of the Bonanza Ledge II Project allowed for continuity of certain mining activities while the Cariboo Gold Project\nenvironmental assessment was underway. In July 2021, the province of British Columbia authorized a permit to extract a\nbulk sample of 10,000 tonnes of mineralized material, the development of a portal and 2,200 m of drift to access the mineral\ndeposit.\nOn October 10, 2023, the Company announced that the EAO had granted the EA Certificate for the Cariboo Gold Project.\nThe Company is progressing in the final permitting approval for the Cariboo Gold project. On May 31st, Osisko as submitted\nits Join Permit Application (\"JPA\") and passed the screening phase of the permit in September 2023. JPA is processing\nthrough the review process and the Company anticipates receiving final approval for the construction and operation in Q4\nof 2024.\nCariboo Gold Project – Permitting Timeline Summary\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Cariboo Gold Project is in advanced stages of permitting and the history of the process is\nsummarized in the following highlights:\n Signing Ceremony on October 23, 2022 with Lhtako Dené First Nation's Elders and Members in Wells and Quesnel\nwas an important event for the life of project agreement between Lhtako Dene First Nation and Osisko Development\nhighlighting the importance of our partnership and mutual support and benefits.\n The Revised Application for the EA Process was submitted to the EAO of British Columbia on October 14, 2022 for\nthe Cariboo Gold Project.

Immediately following\nthe closing of the transaction, Chief completed a merger with a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (the \"Merger\"),\nsuch that, following completion of the Merger, Chief is now owned by the Company. The total consideration to the vendors\nin the aggregate amount of approximately US$156.6 million ($199.5 million), comprised of: (i) cash payments of\napproximately US$58.7 million ($74.7 million), (ii) the issuance to the sellers of convertible instruments amounting to $10.8\nmillion (iii) the issuance of 12,049,449 common shares of the Company and, (iv) Deferred consideration and contingent\npayments fair valued at $15.1 million.\nThe deferred payments consist of an amount of US$12.5 million payable in equal instalments annually over five years in\ncash or shares at the Company's election; (ii) two 1% NSR royalty grants, each with a 50% buyback right in favour of the\nCompany for US$7.5 million which is exercisable within 5 years; (iii) a right to receive the financial equivalent of 10% of the\n15\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nnet smelter returns from stockpiled mineralized material extracted from the Trixie project since January 1, 2018 and sitting\non surface; and (iv) US$10 million contingent upon commencement of production at the Burgin Mine.\nA number of Tintic shareholders had entered into 12-month lock-up agreements which expired on May 27, 2023.\nWith the completion of the transaction, the Company acquired 100% ownership of the producing Trixie test mine, as well\nas mineral claims covering more than 17,000 acres in Central Utah's historic Tintic Mining District. Tintic's ongoing\nexploration work has demonstrated potential for expansion and further discovery both at the Trixie test mine and the broader\nland package. It is hoped that the acquisition of Tintic will, as a result of exploration efforts, serve to accelerate the\nCompany's path towards becoming a mid-tier gold producer and adds further opportunity to explore and develop another\nproject in its portfolio.\nExploration Program\nThe Tintic Project consists of 23 past producing precious and base metal mines located in the East Tintic Mining District,\nUtah, 95 km southwest of Salt Lake City. The Tintic Project is comprised of more than 17,000 acres (6,880 ha), including\n14,200 acres (5,746 ha) of patented mining claims.\nIn 2022, the Company completed 28 surface reverse circulation (\"RC\") drill holes near Trixie totaling approximately 8,442\nm and 62 underground diamond drill (\"DD\") holes in the 625 level at Trixie totaling approximately 3,232 m using two surface\nRC rigs and two underground diamond drill rigs. Continuous underground face samples were collected along all\ndevelopment at Trixie, and together with drill results, formed the basis of an initial mineral resource estimate at Trixie\ncompleted in January 2023.\nIn 2023, the Company completed 73 underground DD holes at Trixie totaling approximately 6,028 m (19,776 ft). As of Q4\n2023, assay results were received for 59 DD holes with assays pending for the remaining holes. For additional information\nplease refer to the Company's news release dated December 21, 2023. One drill rig is active at surface testing for copper-\ngold porphyry mineralization in the Big Hill target area.\nThe 2024 Trixie MRE incorporated an additional 1,674 underground chip samples over 1,678 m (5,507 ft) of underground\ndevelopment, and 7,385 m of drilling (24,229 ft) in 122 holes completed by the Company since the release of the Initial\nTrixie MRE, with an effective date of January 10, 2023.\n2024 T rix ie MRE (al l z ones)\nContained Contained\nTonnes Au Grade Gold Ag Grade Silver\nClassification (000's) (g/t) (000's oz) (g/t) (000's oz)\nMeasured 120 27.36 105 61.73 238\nIndicated 125 11.17 45 59.89 240\nMeasured and Indicated 245 19.11 150 60.80 478\nInferred 202 7.8 51 48.55 315\nNotes\n1.

The mineral resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining (\"CIM\"), Metallurgy and Petroleum's \"CIM\nDefinition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\" adopted by the CIM council.\n16\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\n4. Mineral resources are reported when they are within potentially mineable shapes derived from a stope optimizer\nalgorithm, assuming an underground longhole stoping mining method with stopes of 6.1 m x 6.1 m x minimum 1.5 m\ndimensions.\n5. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n6. Geologic modelling was completed by Osisko Development modeling geologist Jody Laing, P.Geo, using Leapfrog Geo\nsoftware. The 2024 Trixie MRE was completed by Osisko Development chief resource geologist, Daniel Downton, P.Geo\nusing Datamine Studio RM 2.0 software. William Lewis and Alan J. San Martin of Micon International Limited\nindependently reviewed and validated the mineral resource model.\n7. The estimate is reported for an underground mining scenario and with USD assumptions. The cut-off grade of 4.32 g/t\nAu was calculated using a gold price of US$1,750/oz, a CAD:USD exchange rate of 1.30; total mining, processing and\nG&A costs of US$168.04/imperial ton; a refining cost of US$2.65/ounce; a combined royalty of 4.50%; and an average\nmetallurgical gold recovery of 80%.\n8. The stope optimizer algorithm evaluated the resources based on a gold equivalent grade which incorporates the silver\ngrade estimate and assumes a silver price of US$23/oz and metallurgical silver recovery of 45%.\n9. The 2024 Trixie MRE is comprised of six zones within the greater Trixie area: T2, T3, T4, Wild Cat, 40 Fault and 75-85.\n10. Average bulk density values in the mineralized domains were assigned to the T2 (2.955 T/m), T3 (2.638 T/m), T4(2.618\nT/m), Wild Cat, and 40 Fault (2.621 T/m), and 75-85 (2.617 T/m) domains.\n11. Inverse Distance Squared interpolation method was used with a parent block size of 1.2 m x 2.4 m x 2.4 m.\n12. The Company intends to file a technical report in respect of the 2024 Trixie MRE in accordance with NI 43-101 on\nSEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development's issuer profile within 45 days\nof the date of the MRE update News Release.\n13. The 2024 Trixie MRE results are presented in-situ. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes, g/t). The number of\ntonnes is rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.\n13. Neither the Company nor Micon International Limited is aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related,\ntaxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate other\nthan disclosed in the MRE update News Release.\nDevelopments in 2023 and 2024 Objectives\nIn Q4 2023, the Company continued underground exploration and delineation on the Trixie deposit with two diamond drill\nrigs. An initial 5,000 meters of underground infill and exploration drilling was proposed for 2023 at Trixie, with additional\ndrilling recommended subject to results and program progress. For the twelve months of 2023, a total of 6,194 meters were\ndrilled in 73 holes and an additional 1 geotechnical hole totaling 349 meters. An initial 3,000 m of surface diamond drilling\nis proposed to test for copper molybdenum-gold porphyry mineralization on the Tintic Project, property, namely in the Big\nHill area. This drilling commenced in early December 2023 upon receipt of surface drill permits.\nData compilation from historic mines in the area is ongoing and anticipated to generate additional drill targets on the greater\nTintic Project property.\nThe development of an underground ramp, which commenced in July 2022, was completed to the 625 level during Q3 2023\nwith the breakthrough occurring at the end of September. The Company anticipates that the decline ramp will improve\nunderground access for exploration and may potentially support an increase in productivity and mining rates in the future.\nThe ability to achieve any increase in production and the capital required to increase production are the subject of pending\ntechnical work. There can be no assurance that technical work will provide justification for further development, support the\nability to increase production or demonstrate the ability to increase production through a low-capital expenditure expansion\nof the existing facilities. The ability to recommence and expand operations is subject to risks which include the possible\nneed for additional or amended permits, licenses and approvals, risks related to mining operations, the need for additional\n17\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\ncapital and/or operating expenditures, commodity prices justifying such work, potential scarcity of employees, environmental\nrisks and approvals and the limited knowledge of the mineralized material available on site.\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching\nat the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves,\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any\nparticular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects\nhave a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December\n2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023 and, suspended again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining\nat Trixie re-commences, there is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated\nproduction costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's\nability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs may have\na material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. The Company cautions that historically,\nsuch projects have a much higher economic or technical risks. In continuing current operations at Trixie, the Company has\nnot based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability.\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company announced the 2024 Trixie MRE. Compared to the previous 2023 Trixie MRE, contained\ngold ounces in measured and indicated resources decreased by 29% and inferred resources decreased by 79% primarily\ndue to lower estimated grades that incorporated an updated geologic model interpretation and conversion of inferred\nresources. Drill results and underground mapping from the 2023 exploration program improved the knowledge of the extent\nand distribution of mineralization, resulting in modeling improvements to both mineralization and the historical mine shape\nmodel. A technical report in respect of the 2024 Trixie MRE is being prepared and will be filed on SEDAR+ under the\nCompany's issuer profile within 45 days from the date of the MRE Update News Release.\nThe test mining operations at Trixie were suspended in December 2023 and are expected to remain in care and\nmaintenance for the foreseeable future. The drilling of porphyry targets continue and is expected to be completed by the\nend of Q2 2024. Management is currently reviewing its options for next steps at the Tintic Project.\nOn December 31, 2023, an impairment charge of $160.5 million on the Trixie test mine was recorded and the net assets of\nthe Trixie test mine were written down to their net estimated recoverable amount (including mining interest and property,\nplant and equipment) of $51.6 million which was determined using a fair value less costs of disposal model based on a\ndiscounted cash flows approach. The main valuation inputs used were the cash flows expected to be generated by the\nproduction and sale of gold and silver from the Trixie gold mine over the estimated life of the mine, the expected long-term\ngold price per ounce and a discount rate of 10.4% applied to the cash flow projections.\nPlease see the caution section \"Risk Factors: Operations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\".\n6.4. San Antonio Gold Project – Sonora State, Mexico\nIn addition to the Cariboo Gold Project and Tintic Project, the Company also owns the San Antonio Gold Project. The San\nAntonio Gold Project is not considered a material property of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and the date of this\nMD&A.\nThe San Antonio Gold Project is a past-producing oxide copper mine. In 2020, following acquisition of this project, the\nCompany concentrated its efforts in obtaining the required permits and amendments to the permits to perform its activities.\nThe Company has filed preventive reports for the processing of the gold stockpile on site and for a drilling program for the\nSapuchi, Golfo de Oro and California zones.\nThe Company also initiated the following activities:\n Commencement of the Environmental Impact Manifest (or Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental (\"MIA\")) ;\n18\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\n A baseline study;\n Awarding the Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Management contract for the process of the stockpile\nOn April 29, 2023, Mexico's Senate approved a wide-ranging reform of laws governing the mining industry, including a\nrequirement that companies pay a percentage of profits to various stakeholders. The new mining law reduces the maximum\nlength of concessions from 50 to 30 years and may allow authorities to cancel concessions if no work is done on them within\ntwo years. The Company is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to assess the potential impacts on its Mexican\nassets.\nSince Osisko Development's acquisition of the San Antonio Project in November 2020, the Company has successfully\nachieved the following operational milestones:\n The construction of a leach pad and carbon in column plant at the end of 2021 to process stockpiled mineralized\nmaterial.\n 1.1 million tonne stockpile with an average grade of 0.58 g/t Au was placed on the heap leach pad.\n 13,591 net ounces of gold sold from the San Antonio heap leach pad as at December 31, 2023.\nPermitting\nThe Company continued the various permitting activities starting in 2020. These activities consist of obtaining the permits\nfor the MIA and the change of use of land while continuing the work required to complete the environmental baseline study.\nApplications were submitted for four new mining claims, Sapuchi E-82/40881, Sapuchi 2 E-82/40882, Sapuchi 3 E-\n82/40883, and Sapuchi 4 E-82/40888.\nAll documentation required for the change of use land and EA permits were filed and the Company was awaiting the granting\nof these two permits by the Mexican government. In early December 2022, the director of SEMARNAT announced a\nmoratorium on all environmental permits for open pit operations, which will be denied with no approval process in place until\nfurther notice. Subsequently, the Company received communication that the MIA would not be approved. The approval\nprocess for environmental permits for mining may resume after the conclusion of the governor and presidential elections\nwhich will be held in July 2024, with the new president taking office in September 2024. In order to ensure that the San\nAntonio Gold Project would not be further delayed from the granting of the permits, management withdrew both permit\napplications with the intent to refile once the moratorium is lifted or a clear approval process is in place.\n19\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nExploration Program\nA two-phase 45,000-meter drilling campaign was initiated during 2021. The objective of the drill program was to conduct\nexploration and resource drilling at a spacing of 25 meters and historic drilling validation for the three main target areas;\nSapuchi, California and Golfo de Oro. The Company anticipates exploration potential to expand both oxide and sulphide\nresources.\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company announced an initial open pit mineral resource estimate for the San Antonio Project (\"MRE\nSapuchi\"). See tables below. The 2022 MRE Sapuchi covers a portion of the Sapuchi – Cero Verde trend that encompasses\nfive deposits: Sapuchi, Golfo de Oro, California, Calvario and High Life over approximately 2.8 km along strike, a maximum\nwidth of 600 metres (m) to a maximum depth of 300 m below surface.\nThe MRE Sapuchi is based on 84,454 m of current and verified historic drilling in 579 holes, of which 27,870 m of drilling in\n177 holes were performed by the Company in 2021. Gold mineralization is hosted within altered hydrothermal breccia and\nsediments, as stockwork quartz veins and veinlets, adjacent to intrusions and fault structures and often associated with iron\ncarbonate minerals. Metallurgical testing has shown amenability of leaching in the oxide materials and recommendations\nof milling in the transition and sulphide zones.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nfor oxides and $13.0/t for transition and sulphides; and general and administration costs of $2.50/t. The cut-off grades\nshould be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing market conditions (metal prices, exchange rate, mining cost, etc.).\n• A density of 2.55 g/cm3 was established for all oxide zones, 2.69 g/ cm3 for transition zones and 2.74g/ cm3 for the\nsulphide zones.\n• Resources for Sapuchi, Golfo de Oro, California, High Life and Calvario were estimated using Datamine Studio RM 1.3\nsoftware using hard boundaries on composited assays (3.0 m for all zones). Ordinary Kriging interpolation method was\nused in a with a parent block size = 10m x 10m x 5m.\n• Results are presented in-situ. Ounce (troy) = metric tons x grade / 31.10348. Calculations used metric units (metres,\ntonnes, g/t). The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to\nrounding effects; rounding followed the recommendations as per NI 43-101.\nNeither the Company, Servicios Geológicos IMEx, S.C., nor Micon International Limited. is aware of any known\nenvironmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially\naffect the mineral resource estimate other than disclosed in the MRE Sapuchi technical report.\nFor further information regarding the San Antonio Project, please see the technical report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report\nfor the 2022 Mineral Resource Estimate on the San Antonio Project, Sonora, Mexico\", dated July 12, 2022 with an effective\ndate of June 24, 2022 on the Company's website or under the Company's issuer profile at www.sedarplus.ca and at\nwww.sec.gov.\nStockpile\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Sapuchi Minera commenced processing its stockpile inventory through sodium cyanide heap\nleach pads (\"heap leach pad\") and carbon-in-column processing plant. The Company realized its first gold sales in July\n2022 and generated gold sales totaling 10,478 net ounces in 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Sapuchi\nMinera sold 3,113 net ounces of gold sold. During Q3 2023, processing of the remaining stockpile inventory was completed,\nand the Company does not anticipate any production henceforth.\nOn September 30, 2022, the San Antonio gold project was written down to its net estimated recoverable amount of $35.0\nmillion ($nil net of the stream financing), which was determined by the value-in-use using a discounted cash-flows approach.\nThe main valuation inputs used were the cash flows expected to be generated by the production and sale of gold from the\nSan Antonio gold project over the estimated life of the mine, based on the expected long-term gold price per ounce costs\ninflation forecast and the discount rate of 19.9% applied to the cash flow projections.\n2024 Objectives\nThe San Antonio gold project continues to be in care and maintenance. The Company awaits next steps from the\ngovernment of Mexico with respect to the permitting process and the status of open pit mining in the country. In addition,\nthe Board of Directors has authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Project.\n7.

For the three months and year ended December 31, 2023,\nrevenues of $4.6 million and $14.9 million were recorded respectively for operations at the Trixie test mine.\nSmall-batch VAT leaching at Trixie continued during 2023 before the suspension of test mining in December\n2023. Processing of a stockpile at the San Antonio Project generated revenues of $0.8 million and $8.8\nmillion for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023. The cost of sales in relation to the gold\nand silver sold of $32.3 million was also recognized in the consolidated statement of loss for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 ($6.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023). In accordance with IAS\n2, inventories were recorded at the lowest of net realizable value or at costs with an amount of $8.1 million\nas at December 31, 2023 (2022 – nil) recorded to adjust the inventories to their net realizable value.\n24\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\n(b) For the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, other operating costs of $7.8 million and $28.6\nmillion were recognized respectively. These costs mainly relate to the care and maintenance at the Cariboo\nProject, the Tintic test mine and the San Antonio Project.\n(c) General and administrative expenses of $40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2022 - $36.8\nmillion), include $14.3 million of salaries and benefits (2022 - $10.0 million), $7.7 million of share-based\ncompensation expense (2022 - $6.9 million) and $18.1 million of administrative expenses (2022 - $19.9\nmillion) such as insurance fees and legal and other consulting fees. The increases are primarily due to the\ndual public listings in Canada and the US and, SEC registration fees and other corporate activities.\n(d) On December 31, 2023, an impairment charge of $160.5 million on the Trixie test mine was recorded and\nthe net assets of the Trixie test mine were written down to their net estimated recoverable amount (including\nmining interest and property, plant and equipment) of $51.6 million which was determined using a fair value\nless costs of disposal model based on a discounted cash flows approach. The impairment charge was\nrecorded against the Mining Interests. In addition to the impairment charge recorded on the Trixie test mine,\ncertain individual assets located at the Trixie test mine and San Antonio Project were impaired as at\nDecember 31, 2023 for a total amount of $11.5 million. The impairment charges were offset by the decrease\nin the contract liability related to the decrease in contained gold ounces resulting in a catch-up adjustment\nof $33.6 million.\n(e) For the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, other expense net of other income amounted to\n$4.3 million and other income net of other expenses amounts to $5.0 million, respectively. The amount\nincludes the recognition of the accretion expense net of the change in fair value of the warrant liability and\nforeign exchange gains related to impact of variation in exchange rates.\n(f) As at December 31, 2023, the deferred income taxes liability related to the Trixie test mine decreased,\nprimarily due to the reduction in the carrying amount of the Trixie test mine compared to its tax value.\n9. CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes the cash flows (in thousands of dollars):\nThree mo nth s ended Year en ded\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n$ $ $ $\nCash flows\nOperations (13,094) 2,223 (48,540) (40,245)\nWorking capital items 2,958 (13,479) 4,755 (10,013)\nOperating activities (10,136) (11,256) (43,785) (50,258)\nInvesting activities (16,445) (30,912) (66,061) (145,917)\nFinancing activities (979) 7,328 47,789 254,528\nIncrease (decrease) in cash before effects of exchange rate changes\non cash (27,560) (34,840) (62,057) 58,353\nEffects of exchange rate on changes on cash (483) 7,666 (432) 14,184\nIncrease (decrease) in cash (28,043) (27,174) (62,489) 72,537\nCash – beginning of period 71,498 133,118 105,944 33,407\nCash – end of period 43,455 105,944 43,455 105,944\n25\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nOperating Activities\nIn Q4 2023 cash flows used in operating activities amounted to $10.1 million compared to $11.3 million in Q4 2022. Cash\nflows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $43.8 million compared to $50.3\nmillion in 2022. The decrease in operating activities is mainly due to lower operating expenses at all the sites compared to\n2022 partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses. The variation in cash flows was primarily\nattributable to the changes in items of working capital of $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to a\nnegative change in working capital items of $10.0 million in 2022.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities amounted to $16.4 million in Q4 2023 compared to cash flows used in investing\nactivities of $30.9 million in Q4 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the investing activities totaled $66.1 million\ncompared to $145.9 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the acquisition of Tintic in 2022 as well as a reduction\nin mining development activities impacting the level of additions in mining interests and property, plant and equipment. The\nincrease was partially offset by the decrease in exploration and evaluation expenditures. More precisely, the exploration\nspending at BGM decreased and the feasibility study for the CGP project was finalized and published in January 2023.\nFinancing Activities\nThe cash outflows related to the financing activities amounted to $1.0 million in Q4 2023 compared to cash flows provided\nby financing activities of $7.3 million in Q4 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash flows provided by financing\nactivities amounted to $47.8 million compared to $254.5 million in 2022. In 2022 the amount of financing activities was\nhigher due to the proceeds from equity financings of $255.5 million raised from the Brokered Private Placement. The total\nfinancing activities in YTD 2023 include $51.8 million in proceeds from the completion of a bought deal public offering that\nwas done in Q1 2023 (refer to Financings section). This amount is partially offset by the lower amount of share issue and\nfinancing expenses related to the financing. In addition, additional long-term debt was higher in 2023 compared to 2022,\nwhich was partially offset by the decrease in capital payments on lease liabilities.\nSince the inception of the Company up to the date of this report, a total of $640.6 million of capital has been raised through\nbrokered, non-brokered, stream financings, bought deal public offering and a credit facility.\n9.1. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Company's working capital was $21.9 million, which included cash and cash equivalent of\n$43.5 million. The Company incurred a loss of $181.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The working capital\nas at December 31, 2023 will not be sufficient to meet the Company's obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures\nthrough December 31, 2024. Management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events\nand conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, and\naccordingly, the appropriateness of the use of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. The accompanied\nconsolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, expenses\nand financial position classifications that would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These\nadjustments could be material. In assessing whether a going concern assumption is appropriate, management considers\nall available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting\nperiod. In order to execute on its planned activities, the Company will be required to secure additional financing in the future,\nwhich may be completed in several ways including, but not limited to, a combination of selling investments from its existing\nportfolio, project debt finance, offtake or royalty financing and other capital markets alternatives. However, there can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financings in the future, or at terms favorable to the Company.\nSubsequent to the financial year ended December 31, 2023, the Company secured the Credit Facility. See \"4. Highlights –\nSubsequent to Q4 2023 – US$50 Million Credit Facility\".\n26\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nSignificant variations in the liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2023 are explained under the\nCash Flows section. The Company is dependent upon raising funds in order to fund future capital expenditures and\ndevelopment programs. See the \"Risk and Uncertainties\" section of this MD&A for more details.\n10.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nThe decrease in long-term debt is mainly due to a reclassification to short term of a debt that is maturing which is included\nin current liabilities.\nThe contract liability decrease in connection with the related decrease in contained gold ounces discussed in section 8.\nFinancial Performance resulting in a catch-up adjustment of $33.6 million.\nWarrant liability decrease is mainly related to the decrease in the ODV share price.\nThe deferred consideration and contingent payments decreased compared to December 31, 2022 to reflect the settlement\nof a tranche of $2.5 million.\nAs at December 31, 2023, the deferred income taxes liability related to the Trixie test mine decreased, primarily due to the\nreduction in the carrying amount of the Trixie test mine compared to its tax value.\n10.1.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\n16. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe Company's activities, being the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties in Canada and\nworldwide, is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Certain factors, including but not limited to the ones below,\ncould materially affect the Company's financial condition and/or future operating results, and could cause actual events to\ndiffer materially from those described in forward-looking statements made by or related to the Company. Refer to the\n\"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" for more information. The reader should carefully consider these\nrisks as well as the information disclosed herein and, in the Company’s, consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company's view of risks is not static, and readers are cautioned that there can be no assurance that all risks to the\nCompany, at any point in time, can be accurately identified, assessed as to significance or impact, managed or effective\ncontrolled or mitigated. There can be additional new or elevated risks to the Company that are not described herein.\nFor a comprehensive discussion of the risk factors that may affect the Company, its business operations and financial\nperformance, refer to the risk disclosure under the heading \"Risk Factors\" contained in the Company's annual information\nform dated March 28, 2024, for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"AIF\"), which disclosure is hereby incorporated by\nreference herein. The AIF and other publicly filed disclosure regarding the Company, which are available electronically on\nSEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development's issuer profile.\nRisks relating to Additional Financing and Dilution\nOsisko Development's development and exploration activities are subject to financing risks. At the present time, the\nCompany has exploration and development assets which may generate periodic revenues through test mining but has no\nmines in the commercial production stage that generate positive cash flows. The Company cautions that test mining at its\noperations could be suspended at any time. The Company's ability to explore for and discover potential economic projects,\nand then to bring them into production, is highly dependent upon its ability to raise equity and debt capital in the financial\nmarkets. Any projects that the Company develops will require significant capital expenditures. To obtain such funds, the\nCompany may sell additional securities including, but not limited to, the Company's shares or some form of convertible\nsecurity, the effect of which may result in a substantial dilution of the equity interests of the Company's Shareholders.\nAlternatively, the Company may also sell a part of its interest in an asset in order to raise capital. There is no assurance\nthat the Company will be able to raise the funds required to continue its exploration programs and finance the development\nof any potentially economic deposit that is identified on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to obtain the necessary\nfinancing(s) could have a material adverse effect on the Company's growth strategy, results of operations, financial condition\nand project scheduling.\nRisks related to mining operations\nMining operations are and will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration, development and\nproduction of mineral resources and mineral reserves including unusual or unexpected geological formations and other\nconditions such as formation pressures, fire, power outages, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to\nobtain suitable machinery, equipment or labour, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property, and\npossible environmental damage that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate\nor adequately mitigate. The Company may be subject to liability for pollution, cave-ins or hazards against which it cannot\ninsure or against which it may elect not to insure. The payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial position of the Company.\nMajor expenditures are required to develop metallurgical processes and to construct mining and processing facilities at a\nparticular site. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are:\nthe particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which are highly\nvolatile; and governmental regulations, including those relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, allowable\nproduction, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection.\n34\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nOperations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\nCertain operations of the Company including the test mining at Bonanza Ledge II Project and Trixie test mine, have operated\nwithout the benefit of a feasibility study including mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as\na result, there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such\nrecovery. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that\ncommercial production will commence, continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved.\nThe failure to commence or continue production would have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate\nrevenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse\nimpact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability.\nNegative Operating Cash Flow\nThe Company has negative cash flow from operations. As a result of the expected expenditures to be incurred by the\nCorporation for the development of the Company's material projects, the Company anticipates that negative operating cash\nflows will continue until one or both of the Company's material projects enters commercial production (if at all). There can\nbe no assurance that the Company will generate positive cash flow from operations in the future. The Company will require\nadditional capital in order to fund its future activities for its material projects. To the extent that the Company continues to\nhave negative operating cash flow in future periods, it may need to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to fund such\nnegative cash flow. Furthermore, additional financing, whether through the issue of additional equity and/or debt securities\nand/or project level debt, will be required to continue the development of the Company's material projects and there is no\nassurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available or that these financings will be on terms at least\nas favourable to the Company as those previously obtained, or at all. Failure to obtain additional financing or to achieve\nprofitability and positive operating cash flows will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of\noperations.\nNo Earnings and History of Losses\nThe business of developing and exploring resource properties involves a high degree of risk and, therefore, there is no\nassurance that current exploration and test mining programs will result in profitable operations. The Company has not\ndetermined whether any of its properties contain economically recoverable reserves of mineralized material and currently\nhas minimal or no revenues from its projects; therefore, the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows from its\noperations. There can be no assurance that significant additional losses will not occur in the future. The Company's\noperating expenses and capital expenditures may increase in future years with advancing exploration, development, and/or\nproduction from the Company's properties. The Company does not anticipate receiving sufficient revenues from operations\nto offset operational expenditures in the foreseeable future and expects to incur losses until such time as one or more of its\nproperties enters into commercial production and generates sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. There is no\nassurance that any of the Company's properties will eventually graduate to commercial operation. There is also no\nassurance that new capital will become available, and if it is not, the Company may be forced to substantially curtail or\ncease operations.\nForeign Exchange Risks\nThe Company is subject to currency risks. The Company's functional currency is the Canadian dollar, which is exposed to\nfluctuations against other currencies. The Company's activities are located in Canada, Mexico and the U.S.A., and as such\nmany of its expenditures and obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos. The Company maintains its\nprincipal office in Montreal (Canada), maintains cash accounts in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos and\nhas monetary assets and liabilities in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos.\nThe Company's assets and liquidities are significantly affected by changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar and\nCanadian/Mexican peso exchange rates. Most expenses are currently denominated in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and\nMexican pesos. Exchange rate movements can therefore have a significant impact on the Company's costs. The\n35\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nappreciation of non-Canadian dollar currencies against the Canadian dollar can increase the costs of the Company's\nactivities.\nRisks relating to Taxation Laws\nThe Company has operations and conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and it is subject to the taxation laws of each\nsuch jurisdiction. These taxation laws are complicated and subject to change. The Company may also be subject to review,\naudit and assessment in the ordinary course. Any such changes in taxation law or reviews and assessments could result in\nhigher taxes being payable or require payment of taxes due from previous years, which could adversely affect the\nCompany's liquidities. Taxes may also adversely affect the Company's ability to repatriate earnings and otherwise deploy\nits assets.\nPermits, Licences and Approvals\nThe operations of the Company require licences and permits from various governmental authorities. The Company believes\nit holds or is in the process of obtaining all necessary licences and permits to carry on the activities which it is currently\nconducting under applicable laws and regulations. Such licences and permits are subject to changes in regulations and in\nvarious operating circumstances. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary licences\nand permits that may be required to maintain its mining activities, construct mines or milling facilities and commence\noperations of any of its exploration properties. In addition, if the Company proceeds to production on any exploration\nproperty, it must obtain and comply with permits and licences which may contain specific conditions concerning operating\nprocedures, water use, the discharge of various materials into or on land, air or water, waste disposal, spills, environmental\nstudies, abandonment and restoration plans and financial assurances. There can be no assurance that the Company will\nbe able to obtain such permits and licences or that it will be able to comply with any such conditions.\nMineral resource and mineral reserve estimates have inherent uncertainty\nMineral resource and mineral reserve figures are only estimates. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on\nknowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results and industry practices. While the Company believes that the\nmineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, as applicable, in respect of properties in which the Company holds a direct\ninterest reflect best estimates, the estimating of mineral resources and mineral reserves is a subjective process and the\naccuracy of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, the\naccuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting available engineering\nand geological information. There is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource and mineral reserve estimate and the\nactual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from estimates. Estimated mineral\nresources and mineral reserves may have to be re-estimated based on changes in prices of gold or other minerals, further\nexploration or development activity or actual production experience. This could materially and adversely affect estimates of\nthe volume or grade of mineralization, estimated recovery rates or other important factors that influence such estimates. In\naddition, mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resource estimate will\nultimately be reclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not\nhave demonstrated economic viability.\nEconomics of developing mineral properties\nMineral exploration and development is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. While the discovery of an ore body\nmay result in substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are commercially mineable and ultimately developed\ninto producing mines. There is no assurance that any exploration properties will be commercially mineable.\nShould any mineral resources exist, substantial expenditures will be required to confirm mineral reserves which are sufficient\nto commercially mine and to obtain the required environmental approvals and permitting required to commence commercial\noperations. The decision as to whether a property contains a commercially viable mineral deposit and should be brought\ninto production will depend upon the results of exploration programs, preliminary economic assessment and/or feasibility\n36\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nstudies, and the recommendations of duly qualified engineers and/or geologists, all of which involves significant expense.\nThis decision will involve consideration and evaluation of several significant factors including, but not limited to: (a) costs of\nbringing a property into production, including exploration and development work, preparation of, if applicable, preliminary\neconomic assessment and production feasibility studies and construction of production facilities; (b) availability and costs\nof financing; (c) ongoing costs of production; (d) metal prices; (e) environmental compliance regulations and restraints\n(including potential environmental liabilities associated with historical exploration activities); and (f) political climate and/or\ngovernmental regulation and control. Development projects are also subject to the successful completion of engineering\nstudies, issuance of necessary governmental permits, and availability of adequate financing. Development projects have\nno operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow.\nUninsured Risks and Hazards\nMining is capital intensive and subject to a number of risks and hazards, including environmental pollution, accidents or\nspills, industrial and transportation accidents, labour disputes, changes in the regulatory environment, natural phenomena\n(such as inclement weather conditions, earthquakes, pit wall failures and cave-ins) and encountering unusual or unexpected\ngeological conditions. Such risk and hazards might impact the Company's business. Consequently, many of the foregoing\nrisks and hazards could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company's mineral properties or future processing\nfacilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in or interruption of or cessation of their exploration or\ndevelopment activities, delay in or inability to receive required regulatory approvals, or costs, monetary losses and potential\nlegal liability and adverse governmental action. Osisko Development may be subject to liability or sustain loss for certain\nrisks and hazards against which it does not or cannot insure or against which it may reasonably elect not to insure because\nof the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could result in material economic harm to the Company.\nFluctuation in market value of Osisko Development Common Shares\nThe market price of Osisko Development Common Shares is affected by many variables not directly related to the corporate\nperformance of the Company, including the strength of the economy generally, the availability and attractiveness of\nalternative investments, and the breadth of the public market for the stock. The effect of these and other factors on the\nmarket price of the Osisko Development Shares in the future cannot be predicted and may cause decreases in asset values,\nwhich may result in impairment losses.\n17. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (ICFR)\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be\ndisclosed in reports files with the securities regulatory authorities are recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a\ntimely fashion. The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by\nthe Company in such reports is then accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management to ensure timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Management regularly reviews disclosure controls and procedures; however, they\ncannot provide an absolute level of assurance because of the inherent limitations in control systems to prevent or detect all\nmisstatements due to error or fraud. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, along with Management, have\nevaluated and concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and appropriately designed\nas at December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls\nover financial reporting. The Company’s internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with IFRS. Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management\n37\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nevaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making\nthe assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, the Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, together with Management, have concluded that, as at December 31, 2023, the\nCompany’s internal controls over financial reporting were effective and there were no material weaknesses and that there\nhave been no changes in the Company's ICFR that occurred since September 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023 that has\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's ICFR. The Company’s management, including\nthe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those\nsystems determined to be properly designed and effective can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met.\nLimitations of Controls and Procedures\nManagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and\nprocedures or internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system\nmust reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the reality judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or\nmistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more\npeople, or by unauthorized override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving\nits stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective\ncontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n18. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPlease refer to the basis of presentation and statement of compliance in Note 2 of the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n19. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\nEstimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including\nexpectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The determination of estimates\nrequires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience and current\nand expected economic conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions as well as critical judgments in applying the Company's accounting policies\nare detailed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as well as in the\naudited financial statements for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\n20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAll financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. The fair value is based on quoted\nmarket prices, unless the financial instruments are not traded in an active market. In this case, the fair value is determined\nby using valuation techniques like discounted cash flows, the Black-Scholes option pricing model or other valuation\ntechniques. Measurement in subsequent periods depends on the classification of the financial instrument. A description of\nfinancial instruments and their fair value is included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December\n31, 2023.\n38\nOsisko Development Corp.

The Corporation's objective is to become a North\nAmerican intermediate producer of precious metals, through curating and advancing a portfolio of development\nprojects and investments with potential for value creation. Its flagship mining asset is the Cariboo Gold Project, located\nin the District of Wells, British Columbia, Canada. the Corporation's project pipeline is complemented by the Tintic\nProject, located in Utah, United States of America.\nMaterial Properties\nAs of the date of this AIF, the Corporation considers the Cariboo Gold Project and the Tintic Project to be its only\nmaterial mineral properties for the purposes of NI 43-101. The board of directors has recently authorized a strategic\nPage 11\nreview of the San Antonio Project, which includes exploring the potential for a financial or strategic partner in the\nasset or for a full or partial sale of the asset. The Corporation has engaged a financial advisor in connection with such\nstrategic review.\nFor further details regarding the material mineral projects of the Corporation, see Schedule \"C\" – Technical\nInformation – Cariboo Gold Project and Schedule \"D\" – Technical Information – Tintic Project.\nThe Corporation's current strategy is to advance and develop the Cariboo Gold Project and the Tintic Project towards\nthe next phase of development and if at all, to a construction decision. In line with its strategy, the Corporation intends\nto continue advancing various permits and further exploration activities as well as test mining at the Tintic Project.\nInvestments\nThe Corporation's assets also include a portfolio of shares, mainly of Canadian publicly traded exploration and\ndevelopment mining companies. The Corporation may, from time to time and without further notice, except as\nrequired by law or regulations, increase or decrease its investments at its discretion.\nThe following table presents the main investments of the Corporation in marketable securities as at March 28, 2024:\nName of Company Number of Shares Held Ownership\nFalco Resources Ltd. 46,885,240 17.3%\nCornish Metals Inc. 41,487,833 7.8%\nNiobay Metals Inc. 9,857,143 12.3%\nBarksdale Resources Corp. 3,828,261 4.2%\nNotes:\n(1) These securities are held by Barkerville.\nSocial and Environmental Policies\nThe Corporation views sustainability as a key part of its strategy to create value for its Shareholders and other\nstakeholders. The Corporation focuses on the following key areas: (i) promoting social and environmental\nsustainability in its business and operations; (ii) maintaining strong relationships with the Federal, Provincial,\nMunicipal and First Nations governments where the Corporation has activities and projects; (iii) supporting the\neconomic development of regions where it operates; (iv) promoting diversity and integrity throughout the organization\nand the mining industry; and (vi) encouraging investee companies to adhere to the same areas of focus in sustainability.\nEnvironmental Protection\nThe Corporation's exploration and development activities are subject to the federal, state, provincial, territorial,\nregional and local environmental laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Corporation's activities and\nfacilities are located. This includes requirements relating to air and water quality, waste disposal, planning and\nimplementing the closure and reclamation of mining properties and related financial assurance. Each mineral property\nis subject to environmental assessment and permitting processes. In 2023, the Corporation obtained an environmental\nassessment certificate for the Cariboo Gold Project from the Environmental Assessment Officer in British Columbia.\nThe Corporation's Environmental and Sustainability Committee is responsible for overseeing certain health, safety,\ncorporate social responsibility and environmental matters and to recommend to the Board the steps to be taken in\nconnection with these areas of activity. The Environmental and Sustainability Committee held 3 meetings during the\nfinancial year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Corporation's Environmental Policy and Environmental and Sustainability Committee Charter are available on\nthe Corporation's website at https://osiskodev.com/about/#governance.\nPage 12\nSustainable Development\nThe Corporation is committed to promoting ethical, responsible and safe operations focusing on the quality of its\noperations, respect of human rights and local community and cultures as well as the well-bring of its employees. The\nCorporation's Code of Ethics and Health and Safety Policy requires, among other things, that all employees follow all\napplicable laws and regulations wherever the Corporation does business, work safely in accordance with regulatory\nand other industry standards, treat everyone fairly and equitably, work in an environmentally responsible manner and\nrespect the cultures and rights of communities where the Corporation operates its business. The Corporation respects\nand supports the dignity, well-being and rights of its employees, their families and the communities in which it\noperates. The Corporation also sets out to build enduring relationships with its neighbours that demonstrate mutual\nrespect, active partnership, and long-term commitment. The Corporation respects the diversity of Indigenous peoples\nacknowledging the unique and important interests that they have in the land, waters and environment as well as their\nhistory, culture and traditional ways. The Corporation has positive maintained relationships with the Lhtako Dene\nNation, Xatsull First Nation and Williams Lake Indian Band. The Corporation's Code of Ethics and Health and Safety\nPolicy are available on the Corporation's website at https://osiskodev.com/about/#governance.\nBusiness Cycles\nThe mining business is subject to global macro-economic cycles which affect the marketability of products derived\nfrom mining. The Corporation's current exploration and development operations is not cyclical and may be conducted\nall year round.\nForeign Operations\nOne of Osisko Development's material projects, the Tintic Project, is located in Utah, United States. In addition, the\nCorporation also holds interests in other properties located outside Canada, including the San Antonio Project and\nGuerrero Properties located in Mexico. See \"Risk Factors – Risk Factors Related to the Corporation – Enforcing\nJudgments\" and \"Risk Factors – Risk Factors Related to the Corporation – Foreign Operations Risks\".\nSpecialized Skills\nThe Corporation's business requires specialized skills and knowledge in the areas of geology, mining, mineral\nprocessing, environmental management, permitting, First Nations relations and the global commodity markets. To\ndate, the Corporation has been able to locate and retain such professionals in Canada, the United States and Mexico,\nand believes it will be able to continue to do so.\nEconomic Dependence\nThe Corporation's business is not dependent on any contract to sell a major part of its products or to purchase a major\npart of its requirements for goods, services or raw materials, or on any franchise or license or other agreement to use\na patent, formula, trade secret, process or trade name upon which its business depends. It is not expected that the\nCorporation's business will be affected in the current financial year by the renegotiation, amendment or termination\nof contracts or subcontracts.\nEmployees\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Corporation had 118 employees. The Corporation evaluates on an ongoing basis the\nrequired expertise and skills to execute its business strategy and will seek to attract and retain the individuals required\nto meet the Corporation's goals.\nThe Corporation believes it has adequate personnel with the specialized skills required to carry out its business and\noperations and, anticipates making ongoing efforts to match its workforce capabilities with its business strategy as it\nevolves.\nPage 13\nCompetitive Conditions\nThe precious metal exploration and mining industry is highly competitive. The Corporation competes with other\ncompanies in connection with the discovery, acquisition, development and advancement of mining properties, the\nsourcing of raw materials and supplies used in connection with mining operations, the recruitment and retention of\nqualified personnel and suitable contractors, technical and engineering sources and necessary exploration and mining\nequipment. See \"Risk Factors – Risks Factors Related to the Corporation – Competition\".\nRISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation's business, being the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties in Canada and\nworldwide, is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. The risk factors listed below could materially affect the\nCorporation's financial condition and/or future operating results, and could cause actual events to differ materially\nfrom those described in Forward-Looking Information relating to or made by the Corporation.\nIn evaluating the Corporation and its business, the readers should carefully consider the risk factors which follow and\nthe risks set forth in the Corporation's continuous disclosure documents filed on SEDAR+ and EDGAR. These risk\nfactors may not be a definitive list of all risk factors associated with an investment in the Corporation or in connection\nwith its business and operations.\nThe risks described herein and in other documents forming part of the Corporation's disclosure record are not the only\nrisks facing the Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Corporation, or that the\nCorporation currently deems immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect its business. Prospective purchasers\nor holders of Common Shares should give careful consideration to all risk factors enumerated below.\nRisk Factors Related to the Corporation\nMineral Exploration and Development\nMineral exploration and development is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. While the discovery of an ore\nbody may result in substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are commercially mineable and ultimately\ndeveloped into producing mines. There is no assurance that any exploration properties will be commercially mineable.\nShould any mineral resources exist, substantial expenditures will be required to confirm mineral reserves which are\nsufficient to commercially mine and to obtain the required environmental approvals and permitting required to\ncommence commercial operations. The decision as to whether a property contains a commercially viable mineral\ndeposit and should be brought into production will depend upon the results of exploration programs, preliminary\neconomic assessment and/or feasibility studies, and the recommendations of duly qualified engineers and/or\ngeologists, all of which involves significant expense. This decision will involve consideration and evaluation of\nseveral significant factors including, but not limited to: (a) costs of bringing a property into production, including\nexploration and development work, preparation of, if applicable, preliminary economic assessment and production\nfeasibility studies and construction of production facilities; (b) availability and costs of financing; (c) ongoing costs\nof production; (d) metal prices; (e) environmental compliance regulations and restraints (including potential\nenvironmental liabilities associated with historical exploration activities); and (f) political climate and/or\ngovernmental regulation and control. Development projects are also subject to the successful completion of\nengineering studies, issuance of necessary governmental permits, and availability of adequate financing. Development\nprojects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow.\nMining Operations\nMining operations are and will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration, development\nand production of mineral resources and mineral reserves including unusual or unexpected geological formations,\ngeotechnical challenges and other conditions such as formation pressures, fire, power outages, flooding, explosions,\ncave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable machinery, equipment or labour, any of which could result in\nwork stoppages, damage to property, and possible environmental damage that even a combination of careful\nPage 14\nevaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate or adequately mitigate. The Corporation may be subject to\nliability for pollution, cave-ins or hazards against which it cannot insure or against which it may elect not to insure.\nThe payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Corporation.\nMajor expenditures are required to develop metallurgical processes and to construct mining and processing facilities\nat a particular site. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of\nwhich are: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices,\nwhich are highly volatile; and governmental regulations, including those relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure,\nland use, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection.\nOperations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\nCertain operations of the Corporation including the test mining at Bonanza Ledge II Project and the Tintic Project,\nhave been operated without the benefit of a feasibility study including mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and\ntechnical viability, and, as a result, there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of\nmaterial or the cost of such recovery. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical\nfailure. There is no guarantee that commercial production will commence, continue as anticipated or at all or that\nanticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to commence or continue production would have a material\nadverse impact on the Corporation's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve\nthe anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's cash flow and potential\nprofitability.\nUnanticipated Metallurgical Processing Problems\nUnanticipated metallurgical processing problems may occur during operations, including, without limitation,\nmechanical problems with milling or extraction equipment, unexpected grade anomalies in processed material,\ncontaminants in processing or processed material, and the inability to operate tested processes at scale which can lead\nto lower metallurgical recoveries than expected and delay and impede operations, which may affect the potential\nprofitability of the Corporation's material mineral properties. In addition, further metallurgical testing or operations\nmay determine that the metals cannot be extracted as economically as anticipated.\nIndustry Conditions\nThe exploration for and development of mineral deposits involve significant risks and while the discovery of an ore\nbody may result in substantial rewards, few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.\nAll of the Corporation's properties are in the development or exploration stage and the Corporation is presently not\ncommercially exploiting any of its properties and its future success will depend on its capacity to generate revenues\nfrom an exploited property.\nThe discovery of mineral deposits depends on a number of factors, including the professional qualification of its\npersonnel in charge of exploration. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of\nfactors, some of which are the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure,\nas well as metal prices which are highly cyclical and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices,\ntaxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. In the event\nthat the Corporation wishes to commercially exploit one of its properties, the exact effect of these factors cannot be\naccurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in the Corporation not receiving an adequate\nreturn on invested capital. The Corporation's operations will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally\nencountered in the exploration and development of mineral deposits. Mining operations generally involve a high\ndegree of risk, including unusual and unexpected geological formations.\nUncertainty of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates\nMineral resource and mineral reserve figures are only estimates. Mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates have\ninherent uncertainty. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on knowledge, mining experience, analysis of\ndrilling results and industry practices. While the Corporation believes that the mineral resource and mineral reserve\nPage 15\nestimates, as applicable, in respect of properties in which the Corporation holds a direct interest reflect best estimates,\nthe estimating of mineral resources and mineral reserves is a subjective process and the accuracy of mineral resource\nand mineral reserve estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, the accuracy of statistical\ncomputations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting available engineering and geological\ninformation. There is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource and mineral reserve estimate and the actual\ndeposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from estimates. Estimated mineral\nresources and mineral reserves may have to be re-estimated based on changes in prices of gold or other minerals,\nfurther exploration or development activity or actual production experience. This could materially and adversely affect\nestimates of the volume or grade of mineralization, estimated recovery rates or other important factors that influence\nsuch estimates. In addition, mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral\nresource estimate will ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves. Mineral resources which are\nnot mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nNegative Operating Cash Flow\nFor the financial year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, the Corporation had negative operating cash flow of $50.3\nmillion and $43.8 million, respectively, and also reported a net loss of $192.5 million and $181.9 million, respectively.\nFor the same ending periods, the Corporation had approximately $19.1 million and $18.6 million, respectively, in\noutstanding debt mainly related to leasing and equipment financing obligations. As a result of the expected\nexpenditures to be incurred by the Corporation for the development of the Corporation's material projects, the\nCorporation anticipates that negative operating cash flows will continue until one or both of the Corporation's material\nprojects enters commercial production. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will generate positive cash\nflow from operations in the future. The Corporation will require additional capital in order to fund its future activities\nfor its material projects. To the extent that the Corporation continues to have negative operating cash flow in future\nperiods, it may need to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to fund such negative cash flow. Furthermore, additional\nfinancing, whether through the issue of additional equity and/or debt securities and/or project level debt, will be\nrequired to continue the development of the Corporation's material projects and there is no assurance that additional\ncapital or other types of financing will be available or that these financings will be on terms at least as favourable to\nthe Corporation as those previously obtained, or at all. Failure to obtain additional financing or to achieve profitability\nand positive operating cash flows will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nNo Earnings and History of Losses\nThe business of developing and exploring resource properties involves a high degree of risk and, therefore, there is no\nassurance that current exploration and test mining programs will result in profitable operations. The Corporation has\nnot determined whether any of its properties contain economically recoverable reserves of mineralized material and\ncurrently has minimal or no revenues from its projects; therefore, the Corporation does not generate sufficient cash\nflows from its operations. There can be no assurance that significant additional losses will not occur in the future. The\nCorporation's operating expenses and capital expenditures may increase in future years with advancing exploration,\ndevelopment, and/or production from the Corporation's properties. The Corporation does not anticipate to receive\nsufficient revenues from operations to offset operational expenditures in the foreseeable future and expects to incur\nlosses until such time as one or more of its properties enters into commercial production and generates sufficient\nrevenues to fund continuing operations. There is no assurance that any of the Corporation's properties will eventually\ngraduate to commercial operation. There is also no assurance that new capital will become available, and if it is not,\nthe Corporation may be forced to substantially curtail or cease operations.\nFinancing Risks and Additional Financing\nThe Corporation's operations are subject to financing risks and additional financing may result in dilution or partial\nsale of assets. At the present time, the Corporation has exploration and development assets which may generate\nperiodic revenues through test mining, but has no mines in the commercial production stage. The Corporation cautions\nthat test mining at its operations could be suspended at any time. The Corporation's ability to explore for and find\npotential economic projects, and then to bring them into production is highly dependent upon its ability to raise equity\nand debt capital in the financial markets. Any projects that the Corporation develops will require significant capital\nexpenditures. Currently, the Corporation does not have any producing projects and no sources of revenue and any\nprojects it develops will require significant capital expenditures. As a result, the Corporation may be required to seek\nPage 16\nadditional sources of debt and equity financing in the near future. To obtain such funds, the Corporation may sell\nadditional securities including, but not limited to, the Corporation's shares or some form of convertible security, the\neffect of which could result in a substantial dilution of the equity interests of the Corporation's shareholders.\nAlternatively, the Corporation may also sell a part of its interest in an asset in order to raise capital. There is no\nassurance that the Corporation will be able to raise the funds required to continue its exploration programs and finance\nthe development of any potentially economic deposit that is identified on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to\nobtain the necessary financing could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's growth strategy, results of\noperations, financial condition and project scheduling. The development of the Corporation's material mineral\nproperties remains subject to, among other things, Osisko Development securing adequate financing on conditions\nacceptable to it.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Corporation's activities are subject to governmental laws and regulations. These activities can be affected at\nvarious levels by governmental regulation governing prospecting and development, price control, taxes, labour\nstandards and occupational health, expropriation, mine safety, compliance with securities matters and other matters.\nExploration and commercialization are subject to various federal, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to\nthe protection of the environment. These laws impose high standards on the mining industry to monitor the discharge\nof wastewater and report the results of such monitoring to regulatory authorities, to reduce or eliminate certain effects\non or into land, water or air, to progressively rehabilitate mine properties, to manage hazardous wastes and materials\nand to reduce the risk of worker accidents.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement\nactions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring\ncorrective measures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could result in significant\nexpenditures. The Corporation may also be required to compensate private parties suffering loss or damage by reason\nof a breach of such laws, regulations or permitting requirements. It is also possible that future laws and regulations,\nor more stringent enforcement of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional\nexpense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of the Corporation's activities and delays in the\nexploration and development of the projects and properties.\nAmendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies, or\nmore stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation and cause increases\nin capital expenditures or development costs or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining\nproperties.\nAlso, no assurance can be made that the Canada Revenue Agency and provincial agencies will agree with the\nCorporation's characterization of expenses as Canadian exploration expenses or Canadian development expenses or\nthe eligibility of such expenses as Canadian exploration expenses under the Tax Act or any provincial equivalent.\nTaxation Laws or Reviews\nThe Corporation has operations and conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and it is subject to the taxation laws\nof each such jurisdiction. These taxation laws are complicated and subject to change. The Corporation may also be\nsubject to review, audit and assessment in the ordinary course. Any such changes in taxation law or reviews and\nassessments could result in higher taxes being payable or require payment of taxes due from previous years, which\ncould adversely affect the Corporation's liquidities. Taxes may also adversely affect the Corporation's ability to\nrepatriate earnings and otherwise deploy its assets.\nChanges in Economic and Political Conditions and Regulations\nThe economics of the exploration and development of mining projects are affected by many factors, including the\ncosts of exploration and development, variations of grade of mineralized material discovered, fluctuations in metal\nprices, foreign exchange rates and the prices of goods and services, applicable laws and regulations, including\nregulations relating to royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting goods and services. Depending on\nPage 17\nthe price of minerals, the Corporation may determine that it is neither potentially profitable nor advisable to acquire\nor develop properties.\nThe Corporation's mineral properties are located in Canada, the United States and Mexico. Economic and political\nconditions in these countries could adversely affect the business activities of the Corporation. These conditions are\nbeyond the Corporation's control, and there can be no assurance that any mitigating actions by the Corporation will\nbe effective.\nChanging laws and regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions may increase the costs\nrelated to the Corporation's activities including the cost of maintaining its properties. Operations may also be affected\nto varying degrees by changes in government regulations with respect to restrictions on exploration and development\nactivities, price controls, export controls, income taxes, royalties, expropriation of property, environmental legislation\n(including specifically legislation enacted to address climate change) and mine safety. The effect of these factors\ncannot be accurately predicted. Economic instability could result from current global economic conditions and could\ncontribute to currency volatility and potential increases to income tax rates, both of which could significantly impact\nthe Corporation's potential profitability.\nThe Corporation's activities are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing worker health and safety,\nemployment standards, waste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine development, protection\nof endangered and protected species and other matters. Regulators have broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines\nagainst facilities that do not comply with regulations or standards.\nRisk factors specific to certain jurisdictions are described throughout, including specifically \"Foreign Operations\nRisks\". The occurrence of the various factors and uncertainties related to economic and political risks of operating in\nthe Corporation's jurisdictions cannot be accurately predicted and could have a material adverse effect on the\nCorporation.\nEnforcing Judgments\nAs the Corporation is a Canadian corporation and most of its directors and officers reside in Canada, it may be difficult\nor impossible for investors in the United States to effect service or to realize on judgments obtained in the United\nStates predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. A judgment of a U.S. court\npredicated solely upon such civil liabilities may be enforceable in Canada by a Canadian court if the U.S. court in\nwhich the judgment was obtained had jurisdiction, as determined by the Canadian court, in the matter. Investors should\nnot assume that Canadian courts: (i) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against the\nCorporation or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or the\nsecurities or blue-sky laws of any state within the United States, or (ii) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities\nagainst the Corporation or such persons predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or any such state securities\nor blue-sky laws.\nSimilarly, some of the Corporation's directors and officers are residents of countries other than Canada and all or a\nsubstantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside Canada and some of the Corporation's mineral\nassets, including the Tintic Project, are located outside of Canada and are held indirectly through foreign affiliates. As\na result, it may be difficult or impossible for Canadian investors to initiate a lawsuit within Canada against these\npersons or to enforce judgments in Canada against such assets. In addition, it may not be possible for Canadian\ninvestors to collect from these persons or assets judgments obtained in courts in Canada predicated on the civil liability\nprovisions of securities legislation of certain of the provinces and territories of Canada. It may also be difficult or\nimpossible for Canadian investors to succeed in a lawsuit in the United States based solely on violations of Canadian\nSecurities Laws.\nPermits, Licences and Approvals\nThe operations of the Corporation require licences and permits from various governmental authorities. The\nCorporation believes it holds or is in the process of obtaining all necessary licences and permits to carry on the\nactivities, which it is currently conducting under applicable laws and regulations. Such licences and permits are subject\nPage 18\nto changes in regulations and in various operating circumstances. There can be no guarantee that the Corporation will\nbe able to obtain all necessary licences and permits that may be required to maintain its business operations, mining\nactivities, construct mines or milling facilities and commence operations of any of its exploration properties. In\naddition, if the Corporation proceeds to production on any exploration property, it must obtain and comply with\npermits and licences which may contain specific conditions concerning operating procedures, water use, the discharge\nof various materials into or on land, air or water, waste disposal, spills, environmental studies, abandonment and\nrestoration plans and financial assurances. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to obtain such\npermits and licences or that it will be able to comply with any such conditions.\nLocal Communities, Indigenous Peoples and First Nations\nIndigenous title claims, rights to consultation/accommodation and the Corporation's relationship with local\ncommunities may affect the Corporation's existing exploration and development projects. Governments in many\njurisdictions must consult with Indigenous peoples and First Nations with respect to grants of mineral rights or surface\nrights and the issuance or amendment of project authorizations. Consultation and other rights of Indigenous peoples\nand First Nations may require accommodations, including undertakings regarding employment, royalty payments and\nother matters. This may affect the Corporation's ability to acquire, within a reasonable time frame, effective mineral\ntitles or surface rights in these jurisdictions, including in some parts of Canada, Mexico and the United States, in which\nIndigenous or local communities' titles are claimed, and may affect the timetable and costs of development of mineral\nproperties in these jurisdictions. The risk of unforeseen Indigenous title claims also could affect exploration and\ndevelopment projects. These legal requirements may also affect the Corporation's ability to transfer existing projects\nor to develop new projects.\nThe Corporation's relationship with the communities in which it conducts activities are critical to ensure the future\nsuccess of its existing activities and the exploration and development of its projects. There is an increasing level of\npublic concern relating to the perceived effect of mining activities on the environment and on communities impacted\nby such activities. Adverse publicity relating to the mining industry generated by non-governmental organizations and\nothers could have an adverse effect on the Corporation's reputation or financial condition and may impact its\nrelationship with the communities in which it conducts activities. While the Corporation is committed to working in\na socially responsible manner, there is no guarantee that the Corporation's efforts in this regard will mitigate this\npotential risk.\nThe inability of the Corporation to maintain positive relationships with local communities may result in additional\nobstacles to permitting, increased legal challenges, or other disruptive operational issues at any of the Corporation's\nprojects, and could have a significant adverse impact on the Corporation's share price and financial condition.\nEnvironmental Risks and Hazards\nThe Corporation is subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations\nmandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set\nforth limitations on the general, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental\nlegislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties\nfor non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of\nresponsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in\nenvironmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect the Corporation's operations. Environmental hazards may\nexist on the properties which are unknown to the Corporation at present and which have been caused by previous or\nexisting owners or operators of the properties. Reclamation costs are uncertain and planned expenditures estimated by\nmanagement may differ from the actual expenditures required.\nCompetition\nThe Corporation's activities are directed towards the exploration, evaluation and development of mineral deposits.\nThere is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by the Corporation will result in discoveries of commercial\nquantities of mineral deposits. There is aggressive competition within the mining industry for the discovery and\nacquisition of properties considered to have commercial potential. The Corporation will compete with other interests,\nmany of which have greater financial resources than it will have, for the opportunity to participate in promising\nPage 19\nprojects. Significant capital investment is required to achieve commercial production from successful exploration\nefforts, and the Corporation may not be able to successfully raise funds required for any such capital investment.\nAnti-Bribery Laws\nThe Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery\nlaws in other jurisdictions where the Corporation does business, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from\nmaking improper payments for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. The\nCorporation's policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. The\nCorporation operates in jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some\ndegree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs\nand practices. There can be no assurances that the Corporation's internal control policies and procedures will always\nprotect it from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by the Corporation's affiliates, employees or agents.\nViolations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's\nbusiness, financial position and results of operations.\nManagement\nThe Corporation is dependent on certain members of its management, particularly its Chief Executive Officer. The\nloss of their services could adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to grow its business, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business and financial condition. The Corporation is\ndependent on the services of key executives and other highly skilled personnel focused on advancing its corporate\nobjectives as well as the identification of new opportunities for growth and funding. The loss of these persons or its\ninability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees required for its activities may have a material adverse\neffect on the Corporation's business and financial condition. Further, while certain of the Corporation's officers and\ndirectors have experience in the exploration, development and operation of mineral properties, the Corporation\nremains highly dependent upon contractors and third parties in the performance of their exploration and development\nactivities. There can be no guarantee that such contractors and third parties will be available to carry out such activities\non behalf of the Corporation or be available upon commercially acceptable terms.\nImplementation of Business Strategy\nThere can be no assurance that Osisko Development's management team will be successful in implementing its\nstrategy (including as set out in this AIF) or that past results will be reproduced going forward. The management team\nmay experience difficulties in effecting key strategic goals such as the growth and investment in tier one assets, tier\ntwo assets and strategic assets, the sale of non-core assets or the development of exploration projects. The performance\nof the Corporation's operations could be adversely affected if its management team cannot implement the stated\nbusiness strategy effectively.\nConflicts of Interest\nCertain directors and officers of the Corporation also serve as directors and officers of other companies involved in\nnatural resource exploration and development. Consequently, there is a possibility that such directors and officers will\nbe in a position of conflict of interest. Any decision made by such directors and officers involving the Corporation\nwill be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to deal fairly and in good faith with the Corporation and\nsuch other companies. In addition, such directors will declare, and refrain from voting on, any matter in which such\ndirectors may have a material conflict of interest.\nFactors Beyond the Control of the Corporation\nThe potential profitability of mineral properties is dependent upon many factors beyond the Corporation's control. For\ninstance, world prices of and markets for minerals are unpredictable, highly volatile, potentially subject to\ngovernmental fixing, pegging and/or controls and respond to changes in domestic, international, political, social and\nPage 20\neconomic environments. Another factor is that rates of recovery of minerals from mined mineralized material\n(assuming that such mineral deposits are known to exist) may vary from the rate experienced in tests and a reduction\nin the recovery rate will adversely affect potential profitability and, possibly, the economic viability of a property.\nProfitability will also depend on the costs of operations, including costs of labour, equipment, electricity,\nenvironmental compliance or other production inputs. Such costs will fluctuate in ways the Corporation cannot predict\nand are beyond the Corporation's control, and such fluctuations will impact on profitability and may eliminate the\nCorporation's ability to achieve profitability altogether, or if achieved, its ability to maintain profitability. Additionally,\ndue to worldwide economic uncertainty, (i) the availability and cost of funds for development and other costs have\nbecome increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to project; and (ii) global supply chain may also be negatively\naffected. These changes and events may materially affect the financial performance of the Corporation and they may\nalso negatively impact the project schedule.\nLack of Insurance Coverage\nThe Corporation may be subject to liability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards against which it does not or\ncannot economically insure, taking into consideration the importance of the premiums or other reasons. Mining is\ncapital intensive and subject to a number of risks and hazards, including environmental pollution, accidents or spills,\nindustrial and transportation accidents, labour disputes, changes in the regulatory environment, natural phenomena\n(such as inclement weather conditions, earthquakes, pit wall failures and cave-ins) and encountering unusual or\nunexpected geological conditions. Such risk and hazards might impact the Corporation's business. Consequently,\nmany of the foregoing risks and hazards could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Corporation's mineral\nproperties or future processing facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in or interruption of\nor cessation of their exploration or development activities, delay in or inability to receive required regulatory\napprovals, or costs, monetary losses and potential legal liability and adverse governmental action. The Corporation\nmay be subject to liability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards against which it does not or cannot insure or\nagainst which it may reasonably elect not to insure because of the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could result\nin material economic harm to the Corporation.\nFluctuation in Market Value\nThe price of the Common Shares has been and may continue to be volatile. For example, the price per Common share\npeaked at a high price of $26.59 per Common Share in February 2021, shortly following the completion of the RTO,\nand has since declined significantly, reaching a low of $2.54 per Common Share in February 2024 ($2.89 per Common\nShare on March 28, 2024), all on a post-Consolidation basis. Securities markets have a high level of price and volume\nvolatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations in price, including\nas a result of factors outside of such companies' control. The price of the Common Shares is affected by the\nCorporation's financial conditions or results of operations as reflected in its liquidity position and earnings reports.\nThe price of the Common Shares may also be affected by factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects\nof the Corporation, including macroeconomic developments in North America, Mexico and globally, and market\nperceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries, which may increase the volatility of Common Share prices.\nThese include the risks described elsewhere in this AIF.\nOther factors which may influence the price of the Corporation's securities, including the Common Shares, include,\nbut are not limited to: worldwide economic conditions; changes in government policies; investor perceptions;\nmovements in global interest rates and global stock markets; variations in operating costs; the cost of capital that the\nCorporation may require in the future; metals prices; the price of commodities necessary for the Corporation's\noperations; recommendations by securities research analysts; issuances of Common Shares or debt securities by the\nCorporation; exploration and development successes and, if applicable, the share price performance of the\nCorporation's competitors; the addition or departure of key management and other personnel; significant acquisitions\nor business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the\nCorporation or its competitors; news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments,\nregulatory changes and other related industry and market issues affecting the mining sector; publicity or other third\nparty statements or coverage about the Corporation (including its prospects and strategy) and its personnel; loss of a\nmajor funding source; and all market conditions that are specific to the mining industry. There can be no assurance\nthat such fluctuations will not affect the price and liquidity of the Corporation's securities. In addition, a substantial\nPage 21\ndecline in the price of the Common Shares that persists for a significant period of time could cause the Corporation's\nsecurities to be delisted from the NYSE and/or the TSX-V, further reducing market liquidity.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market\nprice of their securities. The Corporation may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could\nresult in substantial costs and damages and divert management's attention and resources.\nFurther, the Corporation's public disclosure record is available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR\n(www.sec.gov) and, to that end, the Corporation does not endorse, and provides no assurance in respect of, any third\nparty statements or coverage about the Corporation.\nCompletion of Announced Transactions\nFrom time to time the Corporation may enter into binding transactions to acquire assets such as mining companies,\nmetals or mineral projects and properties. There can be no assurances the Corporation will successfully complete any\nannounced transactions as a variety of conditions may exist that need to be waived or satisfied prior to completion.\nThere can be no certainty that proposed benefits of transactions to acquire such assets will be realized as anticipated.\nExploration for metals and minerals is a speculative venture necessarily involving substantial risk. There is no certainty\nthat the expenditures on any given project will result in discoveries of commercial quantities of minerals.\nIf mineable deposits are discovered, substantial expenditures are required to establish reserves through drilling, to\ndevelop processes to extract the resources and, in the case of new properties, to develop the extraction and processing\nfacilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for extraction. Although substantial benefits may be derived from the\ndiscovery of a major deposit, no assurance can be given that resources will be discovered in sufficient quantities to\njustify commercial operations or that the funds required for development can be obtained on terms acceptable to the\nCorporation or at all.\nMergers, Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Integration\nFrom time to time, the Corporation examines opportunities to acquire, merge and joint venture assets and businesses\nor conduct any other type of transaction. The global landscape has changed and there are risks associated to such\ntransactions due to liabilities and evaluations with the aggressive timelines of closing transactions from increased\ncompetition. There is also a risk that the review and examination process might be inadequate and cause material\nnegative outcomes. Any transaction that the Corporation may choose to complete may be of a significant size, may\nchange the scale of the Corporation's business and operations, and may expose it to new or greater geographic,\npolitical, operating, financial, legal and geological risks. The Corporation's success in its acquisition activities depends\non its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and\nintegrate the acquired operations successfully with those of the Corporation. Any transactions would be accompanied\nby risks, including those related to changes in commodity prices after the Corporation has committed to complete the\ntransaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; an ore body being below expectations; difficulty\nintegrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies (which may be compounded by\ngeographical separation, unanticipated costs, and the loss of key employees), realizing anticipated synergies and\nmaximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards,\npolicies, procedures and controls across the organization; integration of the acquired business or assets diverting the\nattention of management or disrupt the Corporation's ongoing business and its relationships with employees,\ncustomers, suppliers and contractors; dilution of the Corporation's interests in its assets, including by the decision to\ngrant interests to a joint venture partner; an acquired business or assets having unknown liabilities which may be\nsignificant. In the event that the Corporation chooses to raise debt capital, it may reduce its financial flexibility as the\nCorporation services interest and debt repayments. If the Corporation chooses to use equity as consideration for any\nsuch transaction, existing shareholders may suffer dilution. In addition, many companies in the mining industry have\nrecently seen substantial downward pressure on their equity values after announcing significant transactions. There is\na risk that if the Corporation was to announce a significant acquisition, the value of the Common Shares could decrease\nover the short-, medium- and/or long-term. The Corporation cannot assure that it can complete any transaction that it\npursues, or is pursuing, on favorable terms, or that any transactions completed will ultimately benefit the Corporation's\nbusiness. There can be no assurance that the Corporation would be successful in overcoming the risks noted above or\nPage 22\nany other problems encountered in connection with such transactions or joint ventures. There may be no right for\nshareholders to evaluate the merits or risks of any future transaction or joint venture undertaken except as required by\napplicable laws and regulations.\nPotential Fraud and Corruption\nThe Corporation is subject to risks related to potential to gain benefits from improper transactions and financial\nreporting to hide operational deficiencies or enhance remuneration. Other risks include the potential for fraud and\ncorruption by suppliers, personnel or government officials and which may implicate the Corporation, and its\ncompliance with applicable anti-corruption laws. The Corporation's internal controls might not be sufficient or\nsophisticated enough to identify adequately all potential fraud and corruption.\nForeign Operations Risks\nSome of the Corporation's properties are located in Mexico. Such properties and operations (if any) are subject to\nvarious levels of political, economic and other risks and uncertainties that are different from those encountered at the\nCorporation's North American properties. These risks and uncertainties vary from country to country and may include:\nextreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates; high rates of inflation; labour unrest; risks of war or civil unrest;\nexpropriation and nationalization; renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licences, permits and\ncontracts; illegal mining; corruption; restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation; restrictions or travel; hostage\ntaking; security issues (including theft); changing political conditions; and currency controls.\nIn recent years, criminal activity and violence have increased and continue to increase in certain parts of Mexico. The\nmining sector has not been immune to the impact of criminal activity and violence, including in the form of kidnapping\nfor ransom and extortion by organized crime, direct armed robberies of mining operations and the theft and robbery\nof supply convoys, including specifically for diesel. The Corporation takes measures to protect employees, property\nand production facilities from these and other security risks. There can be no assurance, however, that security\nincidents, in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's operations.\nIn the future, the Corporation may choose to acquire properties or operate in foreign jurisdictions other than the U.S.\nand Mexico.\nLabour Relations\nThe Corporation is dependent on its ability to maintain positive relationships with its employees and there can be no\nassurance that the Corporation will be able to continue to do so in the future. In addition, relations between the\nCorporation and its employees may be impacted by regulatory or governmental changes introduced by the relevant\nauthorities in whose jurisdictions the Corporation carries on business as well as by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse\nchanges in such legislations or in the relationship between the Corporation and its employees could have a material\nadverse impact on the Corporation's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant Influence of Osisko Gold Royalties\nAs of the date hereof, Osisko Gold Royalties owns 33,333,366 Common Shares, representing approximately 39.6%\nof the outstanding Common Shares. As a significant shareholder of the Corporation, Osisko Gold Royalties may\nexercise significant influence over all matters requiring approval of the shareholders of the Corporation, including the\nelection of directors, determination of significant corporate actions, amendments to the Corporation's articles of\nincorporation and the approval of any business combinations, mergers or takeover attempts, in a manner that could\nconflict with the interests of other shareholders of the Corporation.\nUncertainty of Ownership Rights and Boundaries of Resource Properties\nThere is no assurance that the rights of ownership and other rights in concessions held by the Corporation are not\nsubject to loss or dispute, particularly because such rights may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers\nor other land claims and may be affected by defects and adverse laws and regulations which have not been identified\nPage 23\nby the Corporation. There is no guarantee that title to the properties will not be challenged or impugned. The\nCorporation's property interest may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers or native land claims and\ntitle may be affected by undetected defects.\nThird Party Approvals\nThe Corporation may require the consent or approval of third parties in order to enter into or complete certain\nagreements or transactions necessary in the course of its operations. There can be no assurance that such third parties,\nwhich may include shareholders, regulatory bodies or entities with an interest in the applicable property or others\n(including water supply management and availability), will provide the required approval or consent or enter into such\nagreement in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to obtain such third party approval may result in a material adverse\neffect on the Corporation's operations and financial condition.\nCommunity Relations, Social License and Land Claim\nMaintaining a positive relationship with the communities in which the Corporation operates is critical to its business\noperations and the development of the Cariboo Gold Project and Tintic Project.\nThe Corporation may come under pressure to demonstrate that other stakeholders (including employees, communities\nsurrounding operations and their respective countries) benefit and will continue to benefit from its commercial\nactivities, and/or that it operates in a manner that will minimize any potential damage or disruption to the interests of\nthose stakeholders.\nErosion of social licence or activities of third parties seeking to call into question social licence may have the effect\nof slowing down the development of new projects and potentially may increase the cost of constructing and operating\nthese projects. Productivity may be reduced due to restriction of access, proceedings initiated or delays in permitting,\nand there may also be extra costs associated with improving the relationship with the surrounding communities.\nWhile the Corporation is committed to operating in a socially responsible manner and working towards entering into\nagreements in satisfaction of such requirements there is no guarantee that its efforts will be successful, in which case\ninterventions by third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial position and\noperations.\nReliance on Historical Data\nAlthough the Corporation's normal data verification procedures have been employed in connection with the\ncalculations of the mineral resource estimation on the Cariboo Gold Project and sampling, analytical and test data\nunderlying the estimated mineral resources have been verified by qualified persons, an extensive amount of historical\ndata and records on the Cariboo Gold Project was relied on in establishing these calculations. The Corporation cannot\nprovide any comfort that it can rely upon, verify or necessarily authenticate such historical information in connection\nwith its exploitation of the Cariboo Gold Project. The Corporation cannot guarantee that the historical records that are\navailable are free from material errors or inaccuracies. While the Corporation believes that the mineral resource and\nmineral reserve estimates in respect of its Cariboo Gold Project reflect best estimates, the estimating of mineral\nresources is a subjective process and the accuracy of mineral resource estimate is a function of the quantity and quality\nof available data, the accuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in\ninterpreting available engineering and geological information. There is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource\nestimate, and the actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from\nestimates.\nReputational Risks\nReputational risk is the risk that an activity undertaken by an organization or its representatives will impair its image\nin the community or lower public confidence in it, resulting in loss of revenue, legal action or increased regulatory\noversight and loss of valuation and share price. Possible sources of reputational risk could come from, but are not\nlimited to, operational failures, non-compliance with laws and regulations or leading an unsuccessful financing. In\nPage 24\naddition to its risk management policies, controls and procedures, the Corporation has a formal Code of Ethics to help\nmanage and support the Corporation's reputation.\nInflation\nThe Corporation is affected by rising inflationary pressures. A significant portion of the upward pressure on prices\nhas been attributed to the rising costs of labour and energy, as well as continuing global supply-chain disruptions.\nThese inflationary pressures have affected the Corporation's labour, commodity and other input costs and such\npressures may or may not be transitory. Any continued upward trajectory in the inflation rate for the Corporation's\ninputs may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's capital expenditures for the development of its projects\nas well as its financial condition and results of operations. See also \"Risk Factors – Infrastructure and Supplies\" and\n\"Risk Factors – Impairment of Assets\".\nInfrastructure and Supplies\nThe availability of skilled labour, electricity and other necessary supplies at an economic cost cannot be assured. These\nare integral requirements for exploration, development and production facilities on mineral properties. Prices for goods\nand services will fluctuate in relation to the level of investment in the mining sector; it is reasonable to expect that\nincreased demand could impact the Corporation's future economic projections and competitiveness, as it may entail a\nmeaningful increase in costs for various goods and services.\nImprovements in the economic conditions for the mining industry as a whole will typically result in increases to both\nthe costs of planned exploration and development activities, which must also be factored into economic models used\nin projections for future development and potential operations. Increased demand for, and costs of, goods or services\ncould result in delays if they cannot be obtained in a timely manner due to inadequate availability, and may cause\nscheduling difficulties and delays due to the need to coordinate their availability, any of which could materially\nincrease project exploration, development and/or construction costs. These factors could have a material adverse\nimpact on the Corporation's operations and financial results.\nCybersecurity Threats and Information Technology Systems\nThe Corporation is dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of its operations. The Corporation\ncould be adversely affected by network disruptions from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer\nviruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity threats include attempts\nto gain unauthorized access to data or automated network systems and the manipulation or improper use of information\ntechnology systems.\nA failure of any part of the Corporation's information technology systems could, depending on the nature of such\nfailure, materially adversely impact the Corporation's reputation, financial condition and results of operations. The\nCorporation is subject to cybersecurity attacks and related threats from time to time. Although to date the Corporation\nhas not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be\nno assurance that it will not incur such losses in the future. The risk and exposure to these matters cannot be fully\nmitigated because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats. As cyber threats continue to evolve,\nthe Corporation may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective measures\nor to investigate and remediate any system vulnerabilities. In addition, the Corporation's insurance coverage for cyber-\nattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses it may experience as a result of a cyber incident. The Corporation\nand its third party service providers also collects, uses, discloses, stores, transmits and otherwise processes customer,\nsupplier and employee and others' data as part of its business and operations, which may include personal data or\nconfidential or proprietary information. There can be no assurance that any security measures that the Corporation or\nits third-party service providers have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats. If a\ncompromise of such data were to occur, the Corporation may become liable under its contracts with other parties and\nunder applicable law for damages and incur penalties and other costs to respond to, investigate and remedy such an\nincident. Depending on the facts and circumstances of such an incident, these damages, penalties, fines and costs could\nbe significant. Any such event could harm the Corporation's reputation and result in litigation against it.\nPage 25\nThe Corporation's operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks,\nequipment information technology systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risk of\nfailure. Any of these or other events could result in information system failures, delays and/or increases in capital\nexpenditures. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the\nCorporation could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, destruction or corruption of\ndata, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's cash flows, competitive position, financial\ncondition or results of operations. From time to time, the Corporation pursues investments and initiatives to improve\nthe productivity and efficiency of existing systems and operations, including through investments in digital\ntechnologies. There can be no certainty that some or any of such investments and initiatives will meet the Corporation's\ncapital allocation objectives. In addition, certain of such investments and initiatives are still in the early stages of\nevaluation, and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact. Further, there can be\nno certainty as to the time required for the Corporation to extract value from these investments or initiatives, or that\nthe Corporation will achieve any anticipated savings or efficiency improvements.\nEquipment Shortages and Access Restrictions\nThe Corporation's interest in its material mineral properties will require adequate infrastructure, such as roads, bridges\nand sources of power and water, for future exploration and development activities. The lack of availability of these\nitems on terms acceptable to the Corporation or the delay in availability of these items could prevent or delay\nexploitation or development of the Corporation's mineral properties. Natural resource exploration, development,\nprocessing and mining activities are dependent on the availability of mining, drilling and related equipment in the\nparticular areas where such activities are conducted. A limited supply of such equipment or access restrictions may\naffect the availability of such equipment to the Corporation and may delay exploration, development or extraction\nactivities. Certain equipment may not be immediately available, or may require long lead time orders. A delay in\nobtaining necessary equipment could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's operations and financial\nresults.\nLitigation, the Causes and Costs of Which Cannot Be Known\nThe Corporation is subject to litigation arising in the normal course of business and may be involved in disputes with\nother parties in the future which may result in litigation. The causes of potential future litigation cannot be known and\nmay arise from, among other things, business activities, environmental laws, volatility in stock price or failure or\nalleged failure to comply with disclosure obligations. The results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. If\nthe Corporation is unable to resolve litigation favourably, either by judicial determination or settlement, it may have\na material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial performance and results of operations.\nIn the event of a dispute involving the foreign operations of the Corporation, the Corporation may be subject to the\nexclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of\ncourts in Canada. The Corporation's ability to enforce its rights could have a material adverse effect on its future cash\nflows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.\nDividend Policy\nNo dividends on the Common Shares have been declared or paid to date. The Corporation anticipates that, for the\nforeseeable future, it will retain future earnings and other cash resources for the operation and development of its\nbusiness. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board after taking into account many factors,\nincluding the Corporation's earnings, operating results, financial condition, and current and anticipated cash needs and\nany restrictions in financing agreements, and the Corporation may never pay dividends.\nSales by Existing Shareholders\nSales of a substantial number of Common Shares in the public market by existing shareholders could occur, including\nby the Corporation's largest shareholder, Osisko Gold Royalties, which held approximately 39.6% of our Common\nShares as of the date hereof. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of Common\nPage 26\nShares intend to sell Common Shares, could reduce the market price of the Common Shares. This could impair the\nCorporation's ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities.\nPublic Company Obligations\nAs a dual-listed public corporate entity, the Corporation is subject to evolving rules and regulations promulgated by a\nnumber of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the Canadian Securities Administrators, the TSX-\nV, the SEC, the NYSE and the International Accounting Standards Board, which govern corporate governance and\npublic disclosure regulations. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating many\nnew requirements, which increase compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. The Corporation's efforts to\ncomply with these rules and obligations could result in increased general and administration expenses and a diversion\nof management time and attention from financing, development, operations and, eventually, revenue-generating\nactivities. See also \"U.S. Public Company Costs\" below.\nImpairment of Assets\nIFRS requires that the Corporation review for indicators of impairment of the carrying value of its mining assets, and\nto test for impairment when those indicators are present. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the\ntime of prospective impairment reviews, production data, economics and other factors, the Corporation may be\nrequired to record additional write downs of its mining assets. The Corporation reviews and evaluates the carrying\namount of its mining assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such a mining\nasset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of\nsuch mining asset, the Corporation would record an impairment charge for any excess of the carrying value of the\nmining assets over the estimated fair value of such assets. Factors used to estimate fair value may include estimates\nof mineral resources and reserves, expected recoverable ore reserves, grade per ounce, recovery rates, future\ncommodity prices, future production estimates and a commensurate discount rate. The Corporation recorded an\nimpairment of assets related to the Corporation's San Antonio and Cariboo Gold Projects during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. See \"General Development of the Business– Fiscal Year December 31, 2022 – Impairment on\nSan Antonio Project\" and \"General Development of the Business – Fiscal Year December 31, 2022 – Impairment on\nCariboo Gold Project\". The risk that the Corporation will be required to recognize additional impairments of its\nmining assets increases during periods of low commodity prices, high industry cost pressures and high inflation.\nMoreover, additional impairments would occur if the Corporation were to experience sufficient downward\nadjustments to its estimated mineral resources or reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. An\nimpairment recognized in one period may be reversed in a subsequent period. The Corporation may incur additional\nimpairment charges in the future, which could materially adversely affect its results of operations for the periods in\nwhich such charges are taken.\nCompliance with Listing Standards\nThe Corporation must meet continuing listing standards to maintain the listing of the Common Shares on the TSX-V\nand the NYSE, including minimum price of such Common Shares. If the Corporation fails to comply with listing\nstandards and the TSX-V or NYSE delists the Common Shares, the Corporation and its Shareholders could face\nsignificant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for the Common\nShares; reduced liquidity for the Common Shares; a determination that the Common Shares are \"penny stock,\" which\nwould require brokers trading in the Common Shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced\nlevel of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the Common Shares; a limited amount of news about the\nCorporation and analyst coverage; and a decreased ability for the Corporation to issue additional equity securities or\nobtain additional equity or debt financing in the future.\nU.S. Public Company Costs\nAs a public company in the United States, the Corporation incurs additional legal, accounting, NYSE, reporting and\nother expenses that it did not incur as a public company in Canada. The additional demands associated with being a\nU.S. public company may disrupt regular operations of the Corporation's business by diverting the attention of some\nof its senior management team away from revenue-producing activities to additional management and administrative\noversight, adversely affecting the Corporation's ability to attract and complete business opportunities and increasing\nPage 27\nthe difficulty in both retaining professionals and managing and growing its business. Any of these effects could harm\nthe Corporation's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Corporation's efforts to comply with new U.S. laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended\nby regulatory or governing bodies, such regulatory bodies or third parties may initiate legal proceedings against the\nCorporation and its business may be adversely affected. As a public company in the United States, it is more expensive\nfor the Corporation to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and the Corporation is and will be required to\naccept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to continue its coverage. These factors could also make it\nmore difficult for the Corporation to attract and retain qualified directors.\nThe U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002, as amended (the \"U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), requires that the Corporation\nmaintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to Section\n404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\"), the Corporation is required to furnish a report by its management\non the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting (\"ICFR\"), which, if or when the Corporation is no longer\nan emerging growth company, must be accompanied by an attestation report on ICFR issued by the Corporation's\nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nTo achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, the Corporation will document and evaluate its\nICFR, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, the Corporation needs to continue to dedicate internal\nresources, potentially engage outside consultants and maintain a detailed work plan to assess and document the\nadequacy of the Corporation's ICFR, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through\ntesting that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process\nfor ICFR. Despite the Corporation's efforts, there is a risk that neither it nor its independent registered public\naccounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that the Corporation's ICFR is effective as\nrequired by Section 404. This could result in a determination that there are one or more material weaknesses in the\nCorporation's ICFR, which could cause an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the\nreliability of the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. In addition, in the event that the Corporation is not\nable to demonstrate compliance with the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that the Corporation's internal control over\nfinancial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that the Corporation is unable to produce timely or accurate financial\nstatements, investors may lose confidence in its operating results and the price of the Common Shares may decline.\nIn addition, if the Corporation is unable to continue to meet these requirements, the Corporation may not be able to\nremain listed on the NYSE.\nForeign Private Issuer\nThe Corporation is a \"foreign private issuer\" as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended, and is permitted, under a multijurisdictional disclosure system adopted by the United States and Canada,\nto prepare its disclosure documents filed under the U.S. Exchange Act, in accordance with Canadian disclosure\nrequirements. Under the U.S. Exchange Act, the Corporation is subject to reporting obligations that, in certain respects,\nare less detailed and less frequent than those of U.S. domestic reporting companies. As a result, the Corporation will\nnot file the same reports that a U.S. domestic issuer would file with the SEC, although it will be required to file or\nfurnish to the SEC the continuous disclosure documents that it is required to file in Canada under Canadian Securities\nLaws. In addition, the Corporation's officers, directors, and principal Shareholders are exempt from the reporting and\n\"short swing\" profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the U.S. Exchange Act. Therefore, the Corporation's\nShareholders may not know on a timely basis when the Corporation's officers, directors and principal Shareholders\npurchase or sell shares, as the reporting deadlines under the corresponding Canadian insider reporting requirements\nare longer.\nAs a foreign private issuer, the Corporation is exempt from the rules and regulations under the U.S. Exchange Act\nrelated to the furnishing and content of proxy statements. The Corporation is also exempt from Regulation FD, which\nprohibits issuers from making selective disclosures of material non-public information. While the Corporation expects\nto comply with the corresponding requirements relating to proxy statements and disclosure of material non-public\ninformation under Canadian Securities Laws, these requirements differ from those under the U.S. Exchange Act and\nRegulation FD and Shareholders should not expect to receive in every case the same information at the same time as\nsuch information is provided by U.S. domestic companies.\nPage 28\nIn addition, as a foreign private issuer, the Corporation has the option to follow certain Canadian corporate governance\npractices, except to the extent that such laws would be contrary to U.S. Securities Laws, and provided that the\nCorporation discloses the requirements it is not following and describes the Canadian practices the Corporation\nfollows instead. For example, the Corporation does not intend to follow the minimum quorum requirements for\nshareholder meetings as well as certain shareholder approval requirements prior to the issuance of securities under\nNYSE listing standards, as permitted for foreign private issuers. As a result, the Corporation's Shareholders may not\nhave the same protections afforded to shareholders of U.S. domestic companies that are subject to all U.S. corporate\ngovernance requirements.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Corporation is an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.\nThe Corporation will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal\nyear in which the Corporation has a total annual gross revenue of US$1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal\nyear ending after the fifth anniversary of the first sale of equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement\noccurs; (iii) the date on which the Corporation has issued more than US$1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities\nduring the prior three-year period; or (iv) the date the Corporation qualifies as a \"large accelerated filer\" under the\nrules of the SEC, which means the market value of the Common Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds US$700 million\nas of the last business day of the Corporation's most recently completed second fiscal quarter after it has been a\nreporting company in the United States for at least 12 months. For so long as the Corporation remains an emerging\ngrowth company, it is permitted to and intends to rely upon exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are\napplicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include not being\nrequired to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nThe Corporation may take advantage of some, but not all, of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies.\nThe Corporation cannot predict whether investors will find the Common Shares less attractive if the Corporation relies\non these exemptions. If some investors find the Common Shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active\ntrading market for the Common Shares and the price of the Common Shares may be more volatile.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nPrecious and Base Metal Prices\nThe development of the Corporation's properties and revenue (if any) are dependent on the future prices of minerals\nand metals. As well, should any of the Corporation's properties eventually enter commercial production, the\nCorporation's profitability will be significantly affected by changes in the market prices of minerals and metals.\nThe price of precious and base metal prices can fluctuate widely and is affected by numerous factors including demand,\ninflation, strength of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold sales by the central banks, hedging and\nde-hedging activities by producers, global or regional political or financial events, production and cost levels in major\nproducing regions, changes in supply or changes in consumer sentiment, all of which are outside the Corporation's\ncontrol. The aggregate effect of these factors is impossible to predict with accuracy. In addition, precious and base\nmetal prices are sometimes subject to rapid short-term changes because of speculative activities.\nFluctuations in gold prices may materially adversely affect the Corporation's financial performance or results of\noperations. Even if the Corporation discovers commercial amounts of metals on its properties, it may not be able to\nplace the property into commercial production if precious and base metal prices are not at sufficient levels to render\nthe project economically viable. If the market price of gold falls below the Corporation's anticipated all-in sustaining\ncosts per ounce of production at one or more of its properties and remains so for any sustained period, the Corporation\nmay curtail or suspend some or all of its exploration or development activities at such property. In addition, such\nfluctuations may require changes to the Corporation's mine plans.\nPage 29\nClimate Change\nThe Corporation recognizes that climate change is as much an international concern as it is a community concern\nwhich may affect its business and operations, directly or indirectly. The continuing rise in global average temperatures\nhas created varying changes to regional climates across the globe, resulting in risks to equipment and personnel.\nGovernments at all levels are moving towards enacting legislation to address climate change by regulating carbon\nemissions and energy efficiency, among other things. Where legislation has already been enacted, regulation regarding\nemission levels and energy efficiency are becoming more stringent. The mining industry, as a significant emitter of\ngreenhouse gas emissions, is particularly exposed to these regulations. Costs associated with meeting these\nrequirements may be subject to some offset by increased energy efficiency and technological innovation; however,\nthere is no assurance that compliance with such legislation will not have an adverse effect on the Corporation's\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and its share price.\nExtreme weather events (such as prolonged drought or freezing, increased flooding, increased periods of precipitation\nand increased frequency and intensity of storms) have the potential to disrupt operations and transport routes. Extended\ndisruptions could result in interruption to production which may adversely affect the Corporation's business, results\nof operations, financial condition and its share price.\nClimate change is perceived as a threat to communities and governments globally. Stakeholders may increase demands\nfor emissions reductions and call upon mining companies to better manage their consumption of climate-relevant\nresources (hydrocarbons, water etc.). This may attract social and reputational attention towards operations, which\ncould have an adverse effect on the Corporation's business, results of operations, financial condition and its share\nprice.\nOutbreaks of Diseases and Public Health Crises\nThe Corporation may face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which\ncould significantly disrupt its operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and financial conditions.\nAlthough the Corporation's current operations are not being materially impacted by any public health crises (including\nthe Coronavirus disease), the Corporation continues to monitor the developments and impact of any health crises and\npandemic diseases as they may arise. The Corporation cannot estimate whether, or to what extent, any future outbreak\nof epidemics or pandemics or other health crises may have an impact on the business, operations and financial\ncondition of the Corporation. The outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises, such as the\nCoronavirus pandemic, may result in volatility and disruptions in the supply and demand for gold and other metals\nand minerals, global supply chains and financial markets, as well as declining trade and market sentiment and reduced\nmobility of people, all of which could affect commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings, credit risk, share prices\nand inflation. The risks to the Corporation of such public health crises also include risks to employee health and safety,\na slowdown or temporary suspension of operations in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak, increased labor\nand fuel costs, regulatory changes, political or economic instabilities or civil unrest as well as the Corporation's ability\nto service its debt obligations. As such, the impacts of such crises may have a material adverse effect on the\nCorporation's business, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of the Common Shares.\nThere can be no assurance that the Corporation's personnel or its contractors' personnel will not be impacted by these\npandemic diseases and ultimately see its workforce productivity reduced or incur increased safety and medical costs /\ninsurance premiums as a result of these health risks.\nCurrency Fluctuations\nThe Corporation is subject to currency risks. The Corporation's functional currency is the Canadian dollar, which is\nexposed to fluctuations against other currencies. The Corporation's activities are located in Canada, the United States\nand Mexico, and as such many of its expenditures and obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos.\nThe Corporation maintains its principal office in Montreal, Québec, Canada, and maintains cash accounts in Canadian\ndollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos and has monetary assets and liabilities in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and\nMexican pesos.\nPage 30\nThe Corporation's assets and liquidities are significantly affected by changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar and\nCanadian/Mexican peso exchange rates. Most expenses are currently denominated in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars\nand Mexican pesos. Exchange rate movements can therefore have a significant impact on the Corporation's costs. The\nappreciation of non-Canadian dollar currencies against the Canadian dollar can increase the costs of the Corporation's\nactivities.\nInternational Conflict, Geopolitical Instability and War\nInternational conflict and other geopolitical tensions and events, including war, military action, terrorism, trade\ndisputes, and international responses thereto have historically led to, and may in the future lead to, uncertainty or\nvolatility in global commodity and financial markets and supply chains. International conflicts (such as the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict) including any related sanctions or other international action, may\nhave a destabilizing effect on commodity prices, supply chains, and global economies more broadly. Volatility in\ncommodity prices and supply chain disruptions may adversely affect the Corporation's business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. The extent and duration of the international conflicts and related international action cannot\nbe accurately predicted at this time and the effects of such conflict may magnify the impact of the other risks identified\nin this AIF, the financial statements of the Corporation, including those relating to commodity price volatility and\nglobal financial conditions. The situation is rapidly changing and unforeseeable impacts, including on shareholders of\nthe Corporation, and third parties with which the Corporation relies on or transacts, may materialize and may have an\nadverse effect on the Corporation's business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nDIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS\nSince its incorporation, the Corporation has not declared or paid any cash dividends on Common Shares. The\nCorporation currently intends to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of its business, and\ndoes not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future dividend payment will depend on the\nCorporation's financial needs to fund its exploration programs and its future financial growth and any other factors\nthat the Board deems necessary to consider in the circumstances. Under the CBCA, the discretion of the Board to\ndeclare or pay a dividend on the Common Shares is restricted if reasonable grounds exist to conclude that the\nCorporation is, or after payment of the dividend would be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or that the\nrealizable value of its assets would, as a result of the dividend, be less than the aggregate sum of its liabilities and the\nstated capital of the Common Shares. Other than solvency requirements pursuant to the CBCA and pursuant to the\nCredit Agreement which restricts the Corporation from declaring or paying cash dividends (without consent of the\nlenders in accordance with the terms thereof), there are no restrictions in the Corporation's articles or by-laws or\npursuant to any agreement or understanding which could prevent the Corporation from paying dividends. See \"Risk\nFactors\".\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nCommon Shares\nThe Corporation is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Common Shares without nominal or par value, of\nwhich 84,123,410 Common Shares are issued and outstanding as at March 28, 2024.\nThe rights, privileges, conditions and restrictions attaching to the Common Shares, as a class, are equal in all respects,\nset out in the Corporation's articles, by-laws, and in the CBCA and its regulations, and include the following rights.\nDividends\nThe holders of the Common Shares shall have the right to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board, any dividend\non such dates and for such amounts as the Board may from time to time determine.\nPage 31\nParticipation in Case of Dissolution or Liquidation\nThe holders of the Common Shares shall have the right, upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the\nCorporation, to receive the remaining property of the Corporation pro-rata among all holders of Common Shares.\nRight to Vote\nThe holders of the Common Shares shall have the right to one vote per share at any meeting of the Shareholders of\nthe Corporation.\nWarrants\nAs of March 28, 2024, there are 26,958,699 Warrants outstanding, consisting of the 2026 Warrants, the March 2027\nWarrants and the May 2027 Warrants.

Reference should\nbe made to the full text of the technical report, which are available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR\n(www.sec.gov) under the Corporation's issuer profile. The Cariboo Technical Report is subject to certain assumptions,\nqualifications and procedures described herein. In particular, \"inferred\" mineral resources have a greater amount of\nuncertainty as to their existence, economic and legal feasibility. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not\nhave demonstrated economic viability.\nScientific or technical information in respect of the Cariboo Gold Project contained in this AIF, including any updates\nto the scientific or technical information derived from the Cariboo Technical Report and any other and any other\nscientific or technical information in respect of the Cariboo Gold Project contained in this AIF, was prepared by or\nunder the supervision of Maggie Layman, Vice President Exploration of the Corporation, who is a \"qualified person\"\nfor purposes of NI 43-101.\nProperty Description and Ownership\nThe Cariboo Gold Project is located in ODV's Cariboo Gold Project Main Block, a group of claims located in the\nhistorical Wells-Barkerville mining camp of BC that extends for approximately 77 km from northwest to southeast.\nThe Cariboo Gold Project falls within the Cariboo Regional District, a division of the local government system in BC,\nand Wells, BC. Wells is situated 74 km east of Quesnel, approximately 115 km southeast of Prince George, and\napproximately 500 km north of Vancouver.\nODV's land holdings consist of 415 mineral titles totalling 155,088.69 ha across two contiguous property blocks\nknown as the Cariboo Main Block and the QR Mill site. These mineral titles include mineral claims, mineral leases,\nplacer claims, and placer leases.\nThrough its 100% owned subsidiary Barkerville, ODV holds 100% interest in 56 Cariboo Main Block placer titles,\n35 QR Mill Property mineral claims, the QR Mill mineral lease No. 320752, and 362 of the 379 Cariboo Main Block\nmineral and placer claims and placer leases. 17 mineral claims are jointly owned with other companies and individuals:\nODV holds a 97.5% interest in six mineral claims, an 85% interest in two mineral claims, and a 50% interest in the\nother nine mineral claims.\nPage C-1\nA map showing mineral title distribution and ownership is presented below:\nMineral Title and Ownership Map for the Cariboo Gold Project\nThe Cariboo Gold Project also contains 546 private land parcels from Crown-granted mineral claims (3,330.20 ha)\nthat overlap many of the mineral titles where Barkerville is the registered owner on the title of the surface and/or\nundersurface rights to the parcels. A NSR royalty of 5% payable to Osisko Gold Royalties is the only royalty that\napplies to the Cariboo Gold Project.\nFor a summary of permitting and regulatory approvals required on the Cariboo Gold Project, please refer to the section\n\"Environmental and Permitting\" below.\nAccessibility, Climate and Infrastructure\nThe Cariboo Gold Project is located in Wells, BC, approximately 74 km east of the City of Quesnel. The Cariboo\nGold Project is accessible via Highway 26, which branches off Provincial Highway 97 at Quesnel. A network of gravel\nPage C-2\nroads provides access to Cow, Island, and Barkerville Mountains. The Cariboo Gold Project offices and related\nfacilities are located in the town of Wells. The QR Mill is a wholly-owned and fully permitted milling and tailings\nfacility approximately 110 km from Wells. An all season forest service road provides access (500 Nyland Lake Road).\nThe City of Quesnel is the primary supply and service centre for natural resource industries and has the closest regional\nhospital. Manpower is also available in the region. The Cariboo Gold Project has sufficient power and water to support\na mining operation. Canadian National Railway provides rail access from Quesnel to the Port of Vancouver.\nODV has sufficient surface rights in the Cariboo Gold Project area for mineral exploration and development\noperations. These rights are generally conveyed by ODV's Crown-granted mineral claims or by specific permits, such\nas those related to tailings and waste disposal areas, or water and timber use, and the mineral lease currently being\napplied for.\nODV holds seven water licences: one for Willow River, three at the QR Mill, one at the Ballarat temporary work\ncamp, one unused licence on Island Mountain, and one for a well at the geological compound and field offices at\nLowhee Creek. The climate allows for year-round mining operations, and there is enough readily available water to\nconduct diamond drilling.\nThe Cariboo Region experiences a dry continental climate due to the coastal mountains influencing the westerly flow\nof winds and moisture coming from the Pacific Ocean. The climate at the site is characterized by relatively cold\nwinters and mild summers. The annual precipitation is moderate and there is comparatively little variation over the\nyear in monthly precipitation. The Cariboo Gold Project is able to operate 365 days a year.\nHistory\nThe Cariboo Gold Project contains several historical mines, including Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine, Aurum Mine/Island\nMountain Mine, and Mosquito Creek Mine.\nAll \"reserves\" and \"resources\" estimates provided in this section are historical in nature and should not be relied upon.\nThe qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or\nmineral reserves. It is unlikely they comply with current NI 43-101 requirements or follow the CIM Definitional\nStandards, and their relevance and reliability have not been verified. They are included in this section for illustrative\npurposes only and ODV and Barkerville are not treating the historical estimate as current mineral reserves. For the\npurposes of this section, the term \"ore\" is being used in a historical context.\nHistorical Mines\nCariboo Gold Quartz Mine\nFred Wells purchased the Rainbow claim group from A.W. Sanders and formed Cariboo Gold Quartz Mining\nCompany Ltd. (\"Cariboo Gold Quartz Mining\") in 1927. The Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine operated from 1927 to\n1959 at Cow Mountain.\nIn 1959, in its 33rd annual report, the company reported book reserves of 95,265 tonnes of mineralized material,\nincluding a 1952 reserve write-down of 42,275 tonnes of 9.26 g/t Au and another 52,990 tonnes of 12.69 g/t Au\nscattered in 51 mineralized material remnants through 13 levels and across a distance of 10,500 ft (3,200 m).\nThe Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine continued operating using feed from the Aurum Mine until March 1967. During the\nperiod between 1933 and 1967, a total of 1,951,944 tonnes of mineralized material were mined, yielding 863,307 oz\nof gold and 91,652 oz of silver (MINFILE number 093H 019). The average recovery during that period was 95.3%.\nPage C-3\nIsland Mountain Mine (Aurum Mine)\nIn 1925, C.J. Seymour Baker acquired the original five Crown-granted mineral claims (later known as the Aurum\nGroup), at which he worked until 1932. In 1932, Newmont Mining Corporation acquired the Aurum Group and eight\nadjacent claims to form Island Mountain Mines Company Ltd.\nUnder Newmont Mining Corporation's ownership, production from the mine was 699,536 tonnes from which 333,705\noz of gold and 48,130 oz of silver were recovered (MINFILE number 093H 006). The mill also recovered 531 lbs of\nzinc and 134 lbs of lead.\nCariboo Gold Quartz Mining purchased the mine and equipment from Newmont Mining Corporation in 1954 for a\nsum of $305,000. Underground workings extending northwest from the Island Mountain Mine into the Mosquito\nGroup are formally known as the Aurum Mine.\nMosquito Creek Mine\nAndrew H. Jukes, of Calgary, acquired the Mosquito Creek claim group and formed Mosquito Creek Gold Mining\nCompany Ltd. in 1971 to explore the ground above the Aurum Mine. Surface exploration drilling and underground\ndevelopment from 1971 to 1975 were financed by a joint venture agreement with Home Oil Company Ltd. of Calgary.\nThey conducted an extensive surface and underground exploration and development program on the property. In 1975,\nMosquito Creek Gold Mining Company Ltd. purchased all of Home Oil Company Ltd's interest in the property.\nSubsequently, Peregrine Petroleum Ltd. entered into a joint venture agreement with Mosquito Creek Gold Mining\nCompany Ltd., whereby it ultimately earned a 50% working interest in the property.\nA total of 27,384 oz of gold were recovered from 86,248 tonnes of mostly pyrite-type mineralized material milled\nduring the main production period (1980 to 1983). The operation failed due to low initial reserves and a low discovery\nrate of new mineralized material. The latter was the result of insufficient development at depth and northwest of the\nMosquito Fault.\nIn 1984, Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd. optioned the property but dropped it after earning a 10% interest.\nHudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd. sold its interest back to Mosquito Creek Gold Mining Company Ltd. and\nPeregrine Petroleum Ltd. sold its 50% interest to Mosquito Creek Gold Mining Company Ltd.\nIn 1986, the property was optioned by Hecla Mining Company of Canada Ltd. who conducted underground\nexploration work and then dropped their interest in the company.\nMining operations were intermittent until 1987 when Mosquito Creek Gold Mining Company Ltd. became Mosquito\nConsolidated Gold Mines Ltd. After the gold price dropped, and new ore became hard to find, the mine closed in\n1987. During the period between 1980 and 1987, a total of 92,826 tonnes of ore were mined from which 35,054 oz of\ngold and 9,750 oz of silver were recovered (MINFILE number 093H 010).\nIn 1988, Lyon Lake Mines Ltd optioned the property and earned a 50% interest after performing underground\nexploration.\nSurface Work Programs\nCariboo Gold Quartz Mining Company Ltd (1968)\nIn 1968, Dolmage Campbell and Associates Ltd carried out 5 km of bulldozer trenching on behalf of Cariboo Gold\nQuartz Mining. A total of 17 trenches approximately 2 m to 2.5 m deep were excavated across the Baker-Rainbow\ncontact over a strike length of 1.6 km on Island Mountain. Pyritic mineralization, 6 m long by 1 m wide, was\ndiscovered in Trench J.\nPage C-4\nWharf Resources Ltd (1980-1981)\nIn 1972, Cariboo Gold Quartz Mining amalgamated with Coseka Resources Ltd to form a company with the name of\nthe latter. In April 1973, Wharf Resources Ltd (formerly Plateau Metals and Industries) amalgamated with French\nExploration Ltd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coseka Resources Ltd) (\"Wharf Resources\"). Wharf Resources\ncarried out surface drilling programs in 1980 and 1981 to search for near-surface ore on the Cariboo and Island\nMountain claim groups. A total of 7,010 m of percussion drilling and 1,219 m of diamond drilling were completed in\n1980 and 1981.\nBlackberry Gold Resources Inc. (1988)\nIn 1987, Blackberry Gold Resources Inc. completed several work programs on the ARCH 1-4 claim group located on\nCow and Richfield mountains. The objective of the work was to discover gold mineralization associated with the\nsystem of north-striking fault structures. Very low frequency electromagnetic geophysical surveys were used to define\nconductors inferred to be the strike extension of major faults on the Cariboo Group of Crown-granted mineral claims.\nFour strong conductive trends were tested along six fences of percussion drill holes for a total of 2,424 m of drilled in\n79 holes. This was followed by 2,465 m of diamond drilling in 19 holes.\nPan Orvana Resources Inc. (1989-1991)\nOn July 12, 1985, Mosquito Creek Gold purchased the Cariboo and Island Mountain claim groups from Wharf\nResources, Pan Orvana Resources Inc. signed the Cariboo Gold Option Agreement on May 20, 1988, obtaining the\nright to earn a 50% interest in the Cariboo Group, but terminated the agreement in 1991 without exercising the option.\nPan Orvana Resources Inc. excavated 20 surface trenches, drilled four holes and conducted ground geophysical\nsurveys, geochemical sampling programs and geological mapping.\nGold City Mining Corp. (1994-1995)\nIn 1994 and 1995, Gold City Mining Corp. assembled a large land position consisting of 13,000 ha of mineral titles\nbetween Mount Tom and the Cariboo Hudson Mine to form the Welbar Gold Project.\nDoing so involved seven option agreements, including one that covered the Mosquito Creek, Island Mountain and\nCariboo claim groups. The latter was subject to the Cariboo Option Agreement between Mosquito Consolidated Gold\nMines Ltd and International Wayside Gold Mines Ltd. Intera Information Technologies Corp. flew a synthetic aperture\nradar survey in July 1995. DIGHEM I Power completed a regional airborne radiometric- Mag-EM survey of 1,280\nline-kilometres, as well as trenching and diamond drilling on some of their properties, including one drill hole on the\nMosquito Creek Group.\nFrom October 1 to November 30, 1995, Gold City Mining Corp. conducted a 13-hole (1,865 metres) diamond drilling\nprogram on the Cariboo-Hudson Property. Gold City Mining Corp. optioned the Cariboo-Hudson Property from\nCathedral Gold Corp. in 1994. In November 1995, Gold City Mining Corp. sunk four diamond drill holes (560 metres)\non the Williams Creek Property. That same month, Gold City Mining Corp. drilled two holes (390 metres) on the\nIsland Mountain Property.\nInternational Wayside Gold Mines Ltd\n1999-2014\nFrom 1999 to 2014, International Wayside Gold Mines Ltd. drilled 66 holes totaling 8,602 m in surface diamond\ndrilling on the Island Mountain Project.\nPage C-5\n1995-2009\n1995-1999 Work Programs\nInternational Wayside Gold Mines Ltd. worked the Cariboo Gold Project area continuously from May 1, 1995. Most\nof the work was carried out on the main mine trend, either from the surface or underground from the 1,200-level adit.\nIn 1998 and 1999, a secondary target, the BC Vein, was explored over a strike length of 384 m by 31 surface drill\nholes totaling 2,245.2 m. Between 1995 and 1999, International Wayside Gold Mines Ltd.'s drilled 104 holes totaling\n7,349.4 m in surface diamond drilling, 17 holes totaling 654.1 m in underground diamond drilling and 135 holes\ntotaling 5,739.9 m in underground percussion drilling over the Rainbow, Pinkerton, Sanders, Butts and BC Vein zones.\nIn the summer of 1997, International Wayside Gold Mines Ltd. carried out a geochemical and prospecting program\nto find new mineralized showings and generate targets for further exploration. The geochemical surveys yielded 1,079\nsoil samples, 59 stream sediment samples and 121 rock samples.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, International Wayside Gold Mines Ltd. drilled a total of 104 surface diamond drill holes (7,349.4\nmetres), 17 underground diamond drill holes (654.1 metres) and 135 underground percussion drill holes (5,739.9\nmetres).\n2000-2009 Work Programs\nInternational Wayside Gold Mines Ltd. carried out extensive work from 2000 to 2009. During this period, International\nWayside Gold Mines Ltd. drilled 336 holes totaling 49,121.5 m in surface diamond drilling and 76 holes totaling\n6,177.4 m in underground diamond drilling over the Bonanza Ledge zone.\nBarkerville Gold Mines Ltd.\n2010-2014\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Barkerville engaged in surface diamond drilling on the Cariboo Gold Project and drilled a total\nof 318 holes (73,700.1 m).\n2015-2022\nBarkerville as it operated from 2015-2022, will be referred to as ODV. Current ODV management has been in place\nsince 2015 and on November 21, 2019, Osisko Gold Royalties acquired the Cariboo Gold Project through the\nacquisition of Barkerville. The Cariboo Gold Project was part of the Contributed Osisko Assets that created ODV on\nNovember 25, 2020.\nDuring 2015, ODV milled 11,275 tonnes of Bonanza Ledge ore at an average head grade of 10.14 g/t Au, a recovery\nrate of 94%, and an average net operating cost of $877/oz. Based on the results as of February 28, 2015, management\ndecided to cease production and place Bonanza Ledge under care and maintenance.\nIn 2016, ODV mandated InnovExplo to complete a NI 43-101 technical report and Mineral Resources Estimate (the\n\"2017 MRE\") for the Barkerville Mountain deposit. GEOVIA GEMS was used for modelling purposes and the\nestimation approach, which consisted of 3D block modelling and the ordinary kriging interpolation method. The close-\nout date of the database was July 18, 2016, and the effective date of the 2017 MRE was March 21, 2017.\nIn January 2017, ODV began commissioning its wholly-owned QR Mill using the low-grade stockpile at the Bonanza\nLedge open pit. Material sorting was done at the stockpile, producing relatively high-grade pre-concentrate. By the\nend of February 2017, ODV had transported 2,860 tonnes of ore to the QR Mill for an average grade of 2.94 g/t Au.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, ODV began portal and underground development at the Bonanza Ledge Mine to\nprepare for the processing of in-situ Bonanza Ledge material. A total of 470 m of underground development was\ncompleted in 2017, resulting in the processing of approximately 7,000 tonnes of both low-and higher-grade\ndevelopment material at the QR Mill for commissioning and training purposes.\nPage C-6\nIn 2017, ODV mandated InnovExplo to update the 2017 MRE and perform a review and validation of the maiden\nmineral resource estimate for the Cow Mountain and Island Mountain deposits combined. The close-out date of the\ndatabase was December 31, 2017, and the effective date for the 2018 mineral resource estimate was May 2, 2018 (the\n\"2018 MRE\"). Test Mining at Bonanza Ledge was completed in December 2018. The objective was to gain technical\ninformation and train personnel to aid in future studies, permitting, and future mining. A total of 1,900 m of\ndevelopment took place at the Bonanza Ledge Mine in 2018. Approximately 120,000 tonnes of ore was extracted and\nprocessed at an average grade of 5.94 g/t Au. Bonanza Ledge Mine was placed on care and maintenance in December\n2018.\nIn 2019, ODV mandated InnovExplo to review, validate and update the 2018 MRE. Based on the mineral resource\nestimate completed in 2019, ODV mandated BBA Engineering Ltd. to prepare a technical report and preliminary\neconomic assessment for the Cariboo Gold Project (the \"Cariboo 2019 PEA\"). The effective date of the Cariboo 2019\nPEA was August 18, 2019. The Cariboo 2019 PEA provided a base case assessment for developing the Cariboo Gold\nProject as a 4,000 tpd underground mine, with a concentrator located at the Mine Site at Wells and further processing\nat the QR Mill. The mine life was estimated to be 11 years.\nIn 2020, ODV mandated InnovExplo to complete an NI 43-101 technical report to present an updated mineral resource\nestimate and geological model (the \"2020 MRE\") for the Cariboo Gold Project. In 2022, a PEA was completed for\nthe Cariboo Gold Project (the \"2022 PEA\"). The effective date of the 2022 mineral resource update was May 17,\n2022.\nThe Bonanza Ledge Mine resumed development in mid–2019 and in 2020, 3,268 tonnes of ore was extracted at an\naverage grade of 2.58 g/t Au. In 2020, the underground focus was the development of drifts to access the BC Vein. In\n2021, 98,786 tonnes of ore was extracted at an average grade of 4.48 g/t Au (as of December 31, 2021). In 2022,\n170,652 tonnes of ore was extracted at an average grade of 5.16 g/t Au. Development of a new portal to access and\ndevelop a bulk sample at the Cow Mountain portion of the mineral resource was completed in December 2021. The\nBonanza Ledge Mine was placed on care and maintenance again in June 2022.\nGeology and Mineralization\nThe Cariboo Gold Project lies within the Kootenay Terrane of the Omineca Tectonic Belt in the south-central Canadian\nCordillera. The Omineca rocks were complexly deformed by Middle Jurassic to Early Tertiary compressional\ntectonics, and by Tertiary transtension and extension. The Kootenay Terrane in the vicinity of the Cariboo Gold Project\nis subdivided into the eastern Cariboo and western Barkerville subterranes. The Cariboo Subterrane is juxtaposed on\nthe Barkerville Subterrane by the east-dipping Pleasant Valley Thrust.\nThe Snowshoe Group, central to the Barkerville Subterrane, hosts the Cariboo Gold Project. The Barkerville and\nCariboo Subterranes comprise metamorphosed equivalents of continent-derived siliciclastic protoliths with\ninterlayered marble units and granitic orthogneiss. The subterranes are pericratonic in character and are thought to\nhave formed near the current western margin of Laurentia. Various authors suggest that both Barkerville and Cariboo\nSubterranes share the same tectostratigraphic position and depositional environment.\nThe principal gold-producing areas in the Barkerville Subterrane are hosted in rocks metamorphosed to lower-\ngreenschist facies (sub-biotite isograd); amphibolite-facies rocks are locally found on the Cariboo Gold Project but\nare not associated with any significant mineralization. The S1 and S2 fabrics are defined by phyllosilicate minerals\n(sericite and chlorite); they generally define foliation suggesting that peak metamorphic temperature coincided with\nthe formation of cleavage.\nLode-gold mineralization in the Wells-Barkerville mining camp (Cariboo Gold District) shares many characteristics\nwith an orogenic gold deposit model. Gold mineralization is associated with orogenic silica-carbonate-sericite-pyrite\nstable fluids moving along secondary permeability controlled by metamorphic fabrics, vein arrays, faults, lithologic\ncontacts, and rheological contrasts. Deposit types on the Cariboo Gold Project consist of vein and replacement-type\nmineralization grouped into five inter-related styles:\nPage C-7\n1. Fault-fill breccia veins subparallel to foliation (S1), hosted in carbonaceous mudstone;\n2. Vertical northeast-trending extensional veins dominantly hosted in sandstone units in S3 cleavages;\n3. Fractured moderately dipping east-northeast-trending shear veins, hosted in sandstone units;\n4. Gold bearing sulphide replacements hosted in fold hinges of calcareous sandstone units; and\n5. Gold-bearing sulphide replacement mineralization hosted in fault-bounded calcareous siltstone\nunits.\nDeposit Types\nThe Cariboo Gold Project shares many characteristics with an orogenic gold deposit model. This class of deposit is\ntypified by deformed and metamorphosed mid-crustal blocks and major structures, inherent products of orogenesis.\nOrogenic gold deposits span the entire breadth of the province of British Columbia, occurring predominantly within\ntwo main belts. The westerly belt is associated with accreted pericratonic terranes linked to Late Cretaceous to\nPaleocene movement on crustal-scale dextral strike-slip fault systems along the western margin of the Stikine terrane,\nand eastern Coast Belt. The easterly belt is crudely cospatial with the Jurassic to Cretaceous accretion of the\nIntermontane terranes and autochthonous strata of the ancestral North American. Orogenic deposits have significant\neconomic importance, as they are known to host auriferous mineralization as high-grade vein deposits, low-grade\nbulk-tonnage lode deposits, and are intimately linked with substantial placer accumulations.\nMost orogenic gold deposits in metamorphic terranes, such as the Barkerville terrane, are found adjacent to first-order,\ndeep-crustal fault zones, which show complex structural histories and may extend along strike for hundreds of\nkilometres with widths of as much as a few thousand metres. Most orogenic gold deposits occur in greenschist facies\nrocks, but significant orebodies can be present in both lower and higher-grade rocks. Hydrothermal fluids are\ngenerated from metamorphic dehydration reactions along deepcrustal fault zones, driven by episodes of major pressure\nfluctuations during seismic events. Gold mineralization is associated with orogenic silica-carbonate-sericite-pyrite\nstable fluids moving along secondary permeability controlled by metamorphic fabrics, vein arrays, faults, lithologic\ncontacts, and rheological contrasts. Gold deposits form as simple to complex networks of gold-bearing, laminated\nquartz-carbonate shear veins along second and third-order faults, particularly at jogs or changes in strike along major\ndeformation zones.\nMineralization styles vary from stockworks and breccias in shallow, brittle regimes, through laminated crack-seal\nveins and sigmoidal vein arrays in brittle-ductile crustal regions, to replacement- and disseminated-type orebodies in\ndeeper, ductile environments. Mineralization is syn- to late-deformation and typically post-peak metamorphism, and\ncommonly associated with silica-carbonate-sericite-pyrite alteration. Gold is largely confined to the quartz-carbonate\nvein network, but may also be present in significant amounts within iron-rich sulphidized wall-rock selvages, or within\nsilicified and sulphide-rich replacement zones. One of the key structural factors for gold mineralization emplacement\nis often a late strike-slip movement event that reactivates earlier-formed structures within the developing orogen.\nInter-related vein systems are the principal source of gold and silver within the Barkerville trend and are a key fluid\npathway for sulphide mineralization. Axial planar (\"AXPL\") quartz veins represent the dominant vein system hosting\ngold-and-silver-rich sulphide mineralization for the Mosquito Creek, Shaft, Valley, Cow Mountain, Lowhee, and KL\nzone deposits.\nVeins range in width from millimetres to several metres and are termed vein corridors when highly concentrated over\n2 m in width and up to hectometres in strike. Vein corridors are planar structures, typified as steeply dipping, striking\nN020-N050, 100 m–700 m downdip and extending 100 m–300 m along strike. The principal aims of exploration and\ninfill drilling programs involve testing the extent and concentrations of AXPL vein corridor deposits, with targeting\nbased in part on proximity to identifiable large-scale F3 hinge zones.\nReplacement-style gold mineralization contains the most consistently high gold grades in the Cariboo Gold Project\nand were the main target for the historic underground Mosquito Creek Mine on Island Mountain. Semi-massive\nPage C-8\nreplacement style mineralization observed at the historically mined Bonanza Ledge is fault-bounded in the footwall\nof the BC Vein shear. The replacement deposits observed at Island Mountain and Mosquito Creek are thought to be\nstructurally controlled in the hinges of F2 folds and the formation of L-tectonites and considered contemporaneous\nwith the AXPL veining.\nSteep, orogen-parallel, D2-parallel faults, and damage zones act as fluid pathways for crustal fluids. The BC Vein is\na poly-deformed, steeply-dipping, and S1 strike-parallel shear zone of unknown relative offset. The structure is\ninternally characterized by strongly carbonaceous to graphitic siltstone fault breccia, discontinuous pods of brecciated\nmilky white quartz and later stage grey quartz which has, in places, annealed the breccia matrix. Fine-grained pyrite\nand gold are associated with the annealing late-stage grey quartz. The Wells Shear is interpreted as the offset Cow\nMountain equivalent of BC Vein owing to its similar strike, deformational style, and position within\ntectonostratigraphic sequence. The BC Vein-Wells Shear structure is highly variable in thickness both along strike\nand down dip. The close geographic association between this structure and the locations of highest density axial planar\nveining as well as the highest gold grades in both soil and rock geochemical assays is taken to reflect its importance\nas a fluid pathway at the time of mineralization.\nExploration\nODV's exploration team executed a systematic methodology to the exploration program on the Cariboo Gold Project.\nThe program included geological mapping, channel, soil, underground sampling, and diamond drilling.\nThe exploration team has continued its geological mapping across the Cariboo Gold Project's area to identify lithologic\ncontacts, define alterations and geochemical signatures, record micro- and macro-scale structural data, and to collect\nselect rock samples. The targeted deposit types within the Cariboo Gold Project are structurally and/or geochemically\ncontrolled, thus the mapping data continues to play a vital role in refining the geologic model of the area and defining\nmineralized zones.\n2015-2019 Geochemical and Mapping Programs\nFrom 2015 to 2019, ODV executed a systematic approach with surface mapping and geochemical sampling. From\n2015 to 2017, sampling efforts specifically targeted the Barkerville Trend, a major deep-seated shear that trends 60\nkm northwest-southeast through the centre of the Cariboo Gold Project area, called the Cariboo Break at the time. In\n2018 and 2019, the focus shifted to the northwest and southeast extensions of known mineralization around the Wells\narea within the Barkerville Trend. Further exploration was conducted along the parallel Lightning Creek Trend.\n2016 Magnetic and VTEM Survey Program\nIn 2016, a helicopter-borne Magnetic and VTEM Survey was conducted by Geotech Ltd. over ODV's Cariboo Gold\nProject. The survey was flown in southwest to northeast lines spaced 200 m apart. A total of 7,024 line-km of data\nwas acquired. The data was corrected against a base station. The program resulted in 1,308 km2 of geophysical data\nthat confirmed a northwest-southeast anomaly associated with magnetic anomalies.\n2020 Geochemical and Mapping Programs\nGeological surface mapping took place on the Burns Mountain prospect from June 22 to August 4, 2020. Geochemical\nsurveying coincided with mapping on the Yanks Peak prospect from August 18 to September 10, 2020. The\ngeochemical survey then moved to Burns Mountain from September 10 to 29, 2020. The objective at Yanks Peak\nprospect was designed to expand upon the results derived from the 2017 and 2018 geochemical survey completed by\nODV. The grid at the Burns Mountain prospect was designed to infill a gap in the geochemical grid and expand to the\nsouth of Lightning Creek to Chisholm Creek.\nThe 2020 geochemical sampling program was designed to primarily test for soil geochemical signatures in an area\nknown to host several mineral occurrences which lay within a quartzite dominant lithology. A secondary objective\nwas to collect stratigraphic and structural geologic information with emphasis on structural control and the structural\nPage C-9\nrelation to mineralization on the properties. A total of 429 soil samples and seven rock samples were collected on the\nBurns Mountain prospect; 1,187 soil samples and 56 rock samples were collected on the Yanks Peak prospect in 2020.\nThe principal aims of the 2020 mapping program were to refine the understanding of local stratigraphy and structure,\nwith emphasis on the structural controls on mineralization. Additionally, another goal of the program was to delineate\nhighly prospective target areas for future brownfields exploration and provide recommendations for targeting\nmethodology. The program consisted of detailed geologic mapping at a 1:2000 scale at the Burns Mountain, Yanks\nPeak and Cunningham Creek prospects. A total of 43 rock samples were collected at the Burns Mountain prospect, 12\nrock samples at the Cunningham Creek prospect and 42 rock samples at the Yanks Peak prospect. The 2020 program\ncollected an additional 3,060 structural measurement at 905-point locations on the Burns Mountain prospect, 1,036\nstructural measurements at 341-point locations on the Cunningham Creek prospect, and 2,318 structural measurements\nat 706-point locations on Yanks Peak prospect. The anomalous gold-in-soil values along with the data gleaned from\nthe geologic mapping program on these prospects indicated stratigraphy and veining similar to those which are gold-\nbearing in the Wells-Barkerville area.\n2021 Geochemical and Mapping Programs\nGeological surface mapping took place on the Burns Mountain prospect from June 1 to July 25, 2021, and September\n18 to October 3, 2021, and on the Cunningham Creek prospect from August 12 to October 21, 2021. The geochemical\nsurvey took place on the Burns Mountain, Cow Mountain, and Mount Agnes prospects from June 26 to July 21, 2021\nand July 25 to August 31, 2021.\nThe primary objective of the 2021 Soil program was to connect the Burns Mountain and Yanks Peak soil sampling\ngrids along the Lightning Creek Trend. A secondary objective was to begin closing the gap in the soil data between\nCow Mountain and Burns Prospects, following up on anomalies seen in the eastern portion of Burns Mountain and\nwestern portion of Cow Mountain. In total, 651 soil samples were collected on the Burns Mountain prospect, 682 on\nthe Mount Agnes prospect and 20 on the Cow Mountain prospect areas. In addition, a total of eight rock samples were\ncollected on the Mount Agnes prospect and eight on the Burns Mountain prospect by the geochemical sampling team\nin 2021. The 2021 Geologic mapping programs principal aims were to delineate and provide detailed exploration\nstrategies for greenfield-brownfield exploration targets within both Burns Mountain and Cunningham Creek\nprospects. The focus of the mapping efforts in the Burns Mountain area was on Mount Nelson and Oregon Gulch. The\nefforts on Mount Nelson were in following up on geochemical anomalies found in previous years' soil programs.\nOregon Gulch has many historic showings that suggest mineralization in a style comparable to what ODV is targeting.\nOn the Cunningham Creek prospect mapping was focused on the historic Cariboo-Hudson Mine and along the trend\nof it. Detailed geologic mapping was conducted at a 1:2000 scale. A total of 244 rock samples were collected on Burns\nMountain, eight rock samples on Mount Agnes, and 97 rock samples on the Cunningham Creek prospects. The 2021\nmapping team collected an additional 3,509 structural measurements at 844-point locations on the Burns Mountain\nprospect, and 1,390 structural measurements at 407-point locations on the Cunningham Creek prospect. The\nanomalous gold-in-soil values along with the data collected from the geologic mapping program on both prospects\nindicated stratigraphy and veining similar to those which are gold-bearing in the Wells-Barkerville area.\nDrilling\nFrom 2015 to 2022, Barkerville/ODV drilled a total of 2,280 diamond drill holes, totalling 695.08 km of drill core.\nWhile surface data continues to inform the geologic model, diamond drill core is the primary source of geological\ninformation for the Cariboo Gold Project.\nThe objectives for the 2020 and 2021 diamond drilling programs (the \"2020 Program\" and the \"2021 Program\")\nwere to test new brownfields targets adjacent to known deposits, infill high-grade vein corridors modelled from the\nCariboo 2019 PEA classified as Inferred and explore the depth potential of known deposits. The focus of the 2022\ndiamond drilling program (the \"2022 Program\") was the infill of a proposed underground bulk-sampling area, the\ncontinued category conversion from Inferred to Indicated status of modelled vein corridors, and the delineation of\nadditional vein corridors. The 2022 Program started on March 25, 2022, and was completed on July 6, 2022.\nPage C-10\nDrilling Methodology\nDrills are aligned using a Suunto compass. Drill alignments are confirmed using Minnovare's Azimuth Aligner (it was\nused for a part of the 2021 drilling campaign and all of the 2022 drilling campaign). The downhole dip and azimuth\nare surveyed using a REFLEX EZ-TRAC too. Collar locations are determined using a Trimble DGPS. The first survey\nwas usually measured 9 m below the casing, and readings were then taken every 30 m downhole. A survey was also\ntaken at the bottom of the hole if the end of hole (\"EOH\") depth was 15 m or more from the previous test. The\ninstrument was handled by the drilling contractors, and survey information was digitally recorded using IMDEX's\nIMDEXHUB-IQ, as well as transcribed and provided in paper format to ODV geologists.\nAt the drill rig, the drill helpers placed core into core boxes and marked off every 3 m drill run using a labeled wooden\nblock. The drill helpers were also responsible for marking orientation information on the core using either the\nREFLEX ACT IIITM tool or the Devico DeviHead orientation tool. All holes were drilled in NQ diameter unless\nnoted otherwise in the Cariboo Technical Report.\nAll drill hole casings collared at an elevation similar to Jack of Clubs Lake were cemented into bedrock. Special\nconsideration was given to the Valley Zone due to the local groundwater conditions, whereby a cementing procedure\nwas deployed to ensure no groundwater would escape the drill hole once plugged: A first hole was drilled through the\noverburden and cased (HWT size) 6 m to 9 m into competent bedrock. HQ drill rods were then drilled 1 m beyond\ncasing. Once the geologist and drill foreman inspected the rock to ensure the rock was competent bedrock, casing was\nreamed to the bottom of the hole and cemented with the drill foreman present. A PQ displacement plug was then\npushed downhole until cement came up around the casing, leaving it to set. After at least 24 hours, 250 pounds per\nsquare inch (\"psi\") of water pressure was applied to the drill hole. If, during the pressure test, the pressure decreased\nand water was able to escape the cement, the drill hole was either abandoned or recemented. If no issues were\nexperienced during the pressure test, drilling would then commence, and this process was repeated for any additional\nholes. Upon completion of the drill hole, a safety plug was placed 24 m past the shoe and the hole cemented. The HQ\ndrill rods were then removed, and a displacement plug was pumped down the hole. One additional batch of cement\nwas then pumped downhole, and a wait time of 45 minutes was observed, ensuring that no water was seen exiting the\nhole.\nCore Logging Procedures\nThe drill core was transported to ODV's facility in the District of Wells, British Columbia where it was cleaned of\ndrilling additives and mud, and the metres were marked before collecting the data. Recovery for each 3 m drill run\nwas noted. When recovery was less than 2.5 m (>0.5 m of loss), loss was recorded on a separate block as a \"lost core\ninterval\".\nGeotechnical data collection included Rock Quality Designation, Intact Rock Strength, and fracture counts at 1–3 m\nintervals. Magnetic susceptibility data were not collected because it was concluded that such data are not relevant to\nthe deposit. Downhole orientation lines were connected where possible, and orientation off-set measurements were\nrecorded. All data (lithology, alteration, mineralization, structures, interval structures, and veins less and greater than\n5 cm were recorded using Datamine DHLogger software. Sample intervals and pertinent information regarding\nlithology, mineralization and alteration were marked on the core.\nAfter recording the sampling information, drill core samples were cut in half using a diamondblade table mounted\nrock saw. Half the sample was bagged and labelled, then packaged for shipment to an assay lab. Numbered security\ntags were applied to lab shipments for chain of custody requirements. Samples were then shipped to the laboratory of\nALS Minerals (\"ALS\") in North Vancouver, BC, for analysis. The remaining half-core samples are stored on-site in\na secured location for future reference.\nThe QP have not identified drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and\nreliability of the results. In the opinion of the QPs, the core logging and sampling procedures used by ODV are\nconsistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are, therefore, adequate for an advanced exploration\nproject.\nPage C-11\n2015 to 2019 Drilling\nIn 2015, drilling was focused on Barkerville Mountain with 180 holes drilled on the BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge\ndeposit, totalling 35,848.5 m; eight drill holes on the KL Zone totalling 1,675 m, and 12 dill holes on the Barkerville\nMountain deposit totalling 3,626.7 m. The 2015 diamond drill program was designed to drill the BC Vein structure at\na spacing of 25 m to 50 m to a depth of 250 m from surface, and a spacing of 100 m down to a depth of 450 m below\nsurface.\nIn 2016, drilling on Barkerville Mountain consisted of 53 holes on the BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge deposit, totalling\n8,605.5 m, and 10 holes on the KL Zone deposit, totalling 2,621.18 m. The BC Vein area was drilled to infill high-\ngrade areas at 12.5 m to 25 m spacing while the KL Zone was drilled to test an 800 m-long gold-in-soil (\"Au-in-soil\")\nanomaly. Cow Mountain drilling produced 233 drill holes on the Cow prospect, and drill holes on the Valley Zone\nprospect, totalling 31,157.07 m and 1,023.5 m, respectively. The 2016 campaign tested depths of approximately 300\nm. Drill holes were completed on approximately 50 m centres in selected areas. Drilling in the Valley Zone tested the\nlateral extents of AP veins and refined the stratigraphic model. Results showed denser than expected vein occurrences.\nAs a result, three more rigs were added to the program and collar locations were stepped out to expand the intersected\nvein corridors. On Island Mountain, 33 holes were drilled on the Shaft Zone prospect, and 50 holes on the Mosquito\nCreek prospect, totalling 11,289.5 m and 16,026.75 m, respectively. Drilling on Island Mountain was conducted in\norder to understand the structural and lithological controls on gold mineralization, as well as to test the down-plunge\nextent of sulphide replacement zones.\nIn 2017, drilling was again conducted on Barkerville Mountain (BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge, KL Zone, and\nBarkerville Mountain deposits), Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley Zone deposits), and Island Mountain (Shaft Zone\nand Mosquito Creek deposits). Barkerville Mountain drilling produced 25 holes at BC Vein, seven at Bonanza Ledge,\nand one drill hole at KL Zone, totalling 4,412.7 m, 3,388 m, and 530.15 m, respectively. The 2017 drilling program\non Barkerville Mountain explored the Au-in-soil anomaly adjacent to the KL Zone, investigating the 2016 identified\ntargets. Cow Mountain had a total of 17 drill holes at the Cow prospect, and 80 drill holes at the Valley Zone prospect,\ntotalling 6,034.7 m, and 38,872.96 m, respectively. Cow Mountain drilling continued the goals of the 2016 drilling\nprogram. Island Mountain had a total of 211 holes at the Shaft Zone prospect, and 44 dill holes at the Mosquito Creek\nprospect, totalling 93,733.12 m and 13,455.7 m, respectively.\nIn 2018, drilling was conducted on Barkerville Mountain (BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge deposits), Cow Mountain\n(Cow and Valley Zone deposits), and Island Mountain (Shaft Zone and Mosquito Creek deposits). Barkerville\nMountain had a total of 10 drill holes on the BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge deposits totalling 1,683.8 m. The aim of\nthe 2018 Program at Barkerville Mountain was to provide infill data on the BC Vein. In addition, the program\nexpanded upon data collected in 2017 and also targeted vein mineralization concentrated within the hanging wall of\nthe BC Vein. Cow Mountain had a total of 246 drill holes on the Cow prospect, and two drill holes on the Valley Zone\nprospect, totalling 67,715.05 m and 401.9 m, respectively. The aim of the 2018 Program at Cow Mountain was to\ninfill and expand the high-grade gold-bearing vein corridors. Drilling on Island Mountain produced 168 drill holes on\nthe Shaft Zone prospect, and 20 drill holes on the Mosquito Creek prospect, totalling 53,731.29 m and 4,597 m,\nrespectively. The 2018 Program at Island Mountain focused on targets generated by underground mapping and\nsampling data, as well as historical data compiled from smaller scale mapping, trenching, soil sampling and drilling\nprograms. The program aimed to demonstrate continuity and expand on known mineralized vein corridors. Infill\ndrilling was designed to intercept modelled vein corridors with a 25 m spacing at depth in order to convert Inferred\nresources to the Indicated category.\nIn 2019, drilling was conducted on Barkerville Mountain (BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge, KL Zone, Williams Creek,\nand Lowhee Zone deposits), Cow Mountain (Cow prospect), and Island Mountain (Shaft Zone, Mosquito Creek, and\nWillow prospects) (the \"2019 Program\"). Barkerville Mountain had a total of 36 drill holes on the BC Vein and\nBonanza Ledge deposit, 73 on the KL Zone, four on Williams Creek, and 24 holes on the Lowhee zone, totalling\n7,974.2 m, 31,974.62 m, 1,572 m, and 8,422 m, respectively. The 2019 Program on Barkerville Mountain focused on\nexploration for mineralized vein corridors analogous to those on Cow Mountain and Island Mountain within the\nprospective sandstone unit, with drilling on BC Vein to increase confidence in the block model. Cow Mountain had a\ntotal of 72 drill holes on the Cow prospect, totalling 16,136.6 m and was primarily focused on infill drilling and testing\ndown dip extents of mineralized vein corridors. Island Mountain had a total of 26 drill holes on the Shaft Zone\nprospect, 15 on the Mosquito Creek prospect, and six on the Willow prospect, totalling 12,032.45 m, 8,258.89 m, and\nPage C-12\n3,078.9 m, respectively. The objective of the 2019 Program on Island Mountain was to infill high-grade areas currently\nclassified as Inferred on the Mosquito and Shaft Zones and to test the strike and depth extent of the mineralized vein\ncorridors. Exploration to the northwest of Mosquito Creek also occurred on what is known as the Willow Target, an\nAu-in-soil geochemical anomaly identified from 2018 soil sampling. Additionally, the Proserpine property had a total\nof six (6) holes drilled, totalling 2,676.25 m. This program was aimed at testing Au-in-soil anomalies and historical\ngold occurrences, as well as historical underground workings.\n2020 Drilling Program\nThe 2020 Program was conducted between January 16, 2020, and December 14, 2020, by Smithers, B.C. based Hy-\nTech Drilling Ltd. and its primary focus was delineating the Cow-Island-Barkerville corridor. A total of 57,078.8 m\nwas drilled in 201 surface holes. The objective of this program was to delineate mineralized vein corridors further\nwithin all deposits and intercept veins with a 25 m spacing from previously drilled holes in order to convert Inferred\nresources to the Indicated category. The below table provides a summary of Barkerville's 2020 Program:\nDeposit Number of Drill Holes Metres Drilled\nBC Vein and Bonanza Ledge 3 560.60\nLowhee Zone 24 10,144.50\nCow Mountain 48 12,596.05\nValley Zone 56 17,558.85\nShaft Zone 15 3,909.00\nMosquito Creek 50 9,392.40\nProserpine 5 2,917.40\nTotal 201 57,078.80\nOverall, visual inspection of the 2020 drilling results demonstrated that the thickness and the grade of the mineralized\nzones were in the same order of magnitude as the 2020 MRE. The 2020 drilling continued to confirm the geological\nand grade continuities that were demonstrated in the 2020 MRE.\n2021 Drilling Program\nThe 2021 Program was conducted by Hy-Tech Drilling Ltd. between January 4, 2021 and October 20, 2021. The 2021\nProgram also saw the addition of Paycore Drilling, based in Valemount, British Columbia, between August 18, 2021,\nand October 16, 2021.\nThe 2021 Program at Island Mountain focused on Shaft Zone with 60,990.8 m drilled in 162 holes, and Mosquito\nCreek totalling 10,710.65 m drilled in 42 holes, further continuing the category conversion work from Inferred to\nIndicated status within known vein corridors.\nThe 2021 Program at Cow Mountain was primarily focused in the Valley Zone to continue category conversion work\nand expand known mineralized vein corridors with a total of 47,484.92 m drilled in 108 holes. Minor drilling on Cow\nMountain was conducted, totalling 1,988.5 m drilled in six (6) holes. The purpose of this drilling was to conduct\nmetallurgical testing of modelled vein corridors.\nThe 2021 Program at Lowhee Zone continued to define the prospect, targeting mineralized vein corridors within the\nprospective sandstone unit analogous to those on Cow Mountain and Island Mountain. A total of 29,860.9 m was\ndrilled in 95 holes. Drill hole spacing along the modelled vein corridors was kept to a distance of 25 m.\n2022 Drilling Program\nThe 2022 Program was conducted by Hy-Tech Drilling Ltd. at the Lowhee Zone on Barkerville Mountain. The 2022\nProgram started on March 25, 2022, and was completed on of July 6, 2022. The focus of the 2022 Program at the\nPage C-13\nLowhee Zone was the infill of a proposed underground bulk sampling area, the continued category conversion from\nInferred to Indicated status of modelled vein corridors, and the delineation of additional vein corridors.\nAssay results from 27 drill holes were received after April 6, 2022, representing 6,563.9 m of assays, and, as such, are\nexcluded from the 2022 FS MRE (as defined herein). Overall, the visual inspection of the 2022 drilling results\ndemonstrated that the thickness and the grade of the mineralized zones are in the same order of magnitude as the 2022\nFS MRE. The 2022 drilling continues to confirm the geological and grade continuities that were demonstrated in the\n2022 FS MRE.\nSample Preparation, Analyses and Security\nThe following paragraphs describe the sample preparation, analysis and security procedures of the 2020 and 2021\nPrograms included in the current resource estimate in the Cariboo Technical Report. The QPs reviewed the QA/QC\nprocedures and results completed only on gold assay results.\nCore Handling, Sampling and Security\nCore handling, sampling, and security procedures as detailed in this section are managed by ODV personnel.\nThe drill core is placed into wooden core boxes at the drill site with the end of each drill run marked with a small\nwooden block displaying the depth of the hole. Box labels indicate the hole and box numbers. The boxes are racked\nand covered at the drill, secured with ratchet straps, and then transported daily from the drill site to ODV's core storage\nand logging facility in the District of Wells, British Columbia. The boxes are labelled in permanent marker with the\nhole and box number (e.g., GR-15-01 Bx 1). The core is transported by truck during the drilling programs. There are\ntwo secure core storage areas, one in Wells near the core logging facility and a second is located near the Ballarat\nCamp, approximately 5 km east of Wells.\nUpon receiving a load of core from the drill crew, the core is brought into the logging room. Meterage blocks are\nchecked for errors, the core is oriented in the box and cleaned, and the metre marks are drawn on the core before\nlogging begins. The geological and geotechnical core logging data is collected with Datamine's DHLogger software.\nThe sample intervals are between 0.5 m and 1.5 m in length and do not cross geological contacts. A line is drawn with\na pencil along the length of the core to indicate where the core will be sawed. Each sampling ticket is divided into\nthree tags. One tag is stapled to the core box at the beginning of the interval to record the drill hole number and sample\ninterval recorded. The second tag is placed in the sample bag, which is sent to the laboratory; this tag does not reference\nthe drill hole or meterage. The last tag remains in the sample ticket book with the hole number and recorded intervals.\nAll samples are assigned a unique sample number.\nAfter the core boxes with tags are photographed, the core boxes are moved to the cutting station. The core is cut\nlengthwise by diamond saw, with half the core submitted as the primary sample and the remaining half core retained\nin the core box for future reference.\nThe samples are individually bagged with the corresponding tag. The tag number is written on the bag and each bag\nis sealed. The bags are then placed in rice bags and the rice bags are sealed with numbered security tags for the chain\nof custody requirements. If any tampering with security tags is suspected, the laboratory will communicate with ODV.\nSamples are transported to the ALS laboratory in Vancouver, BC and the remaining drill core is subsequently stored\non site at ODV's secure facilities in Wells and at a second location near the Ballarat Camp.\nSample Preparation and Assay\nSample Preparation\n• Samples are sorted and logged into the ALS LIMS program;\n• Samples are dried and weighed;\nPage C-14\n• Samples are crushed to +70% passing 2 mm (CRU-31);\n• The crushed sample split of up to 500g is pulverized to +85% passing 75 μm screen (PUL 32m);\n• Samples containing visible gold or cosalite mineralization are assayed by metallic screen method; a\ncrushed sample split of 1,000 g is pulverized (method PUL-32) to pass 100 μm (Tyler 150 mesh)\nstainless steel screen to separate the oversize fractions (method SCR-21).\nGold Assaying\n• A 50 g pulp aliquot is analyzed by Au-AA26: fire assay followed by aqua regia digestion (HNO3‐\nHCl) with an atomic absorption spectroscopy finish (\"AAS\");\n• When assay results are higher than 100 g/t Au, a second 50 g pulp aliquot is analyzed by Au-GRA22:\nfire assay (\"FA\"), parting with nitric acid (HNO3) with a gravimetric finish;\n• All samples containing visible gold or cosalite mineralization are assayed by the metallic screen\nmethod (method Au-SCR21). At the request of ODV, any sample exceeding 100 g/t Au (Au-AA26)\nis rerun with the screen method following the procedure below;\n• For visible gold assays or cosalite mineralization, the +100 μm fraction (Au+) is analyzed in its\nentirety by fire assay with gravimetric finish. The 100 μm fraction (minus) is homogenized and two\nsubsamples are analyzed by FA with AAS (Au-AA25) or gravimetric finish (AuGRA21). The\naverage of the two minus fraction subsamples are taken and reported as the Au-fraction result. The\ngold content is then determined by the weighted average of the Au+ and Au- fractions.\nMulti-Element Assaying\n• Some samples are analyzed by trace-level multi-element method ME‐MS61: a 0.25 g aliquot is\ndigested by four-acid digestion (HNO3‐HClO4‐HF‐HCl) and HCl leach (method GEO-4A01) and\nanalyzed by ICP-AES;\n• Following this analysis, the results are reviewed for high concentrations of bismuth, mercury,\nmolybdenum, silver, and tungsten and diluted accordingly. Samples meeting these criteria are then\nanalyzed by ICP-MS. Results are corrected for spectral interelement interferences.\nSpecific Gravity Measurements\n• Before crushing and pulverizing, the specific gravity of selected samples is determined by the bulk\nsample method (water displacement, OA GRA08).\nQuality Assurance and Quality Control\nA total of 49,243 and 111,361 samples (including QA/QC samples) were assayed during 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nThe 2020 and 2021 QA/QC programs included a routine insertion of standards and blanks to monitor gold assay\nresults. ODV included one standard in every 20 samples and one blank in every 40 samples. The 2020 and 2021\nQA/QC programs did not include field or coarse reject duplicates.\nAccuracy is monitored by adding standards at the rate of one certified reference materials (\"CRM\") for every 20\nsamples. Standards are used to detect assay problems with specific sample batches and any possible long-term biases\nin the overall dataset. ODV's definition of a quality control failure is when:\n• Assays for a CRM are outside plus or minus three standard deviations (±3SD) or ±10%; or\nPage C-15\n• Assays for two consecutive CRMs are outside ±2SD, if one of them is outside ±3SD.\nConclusions\nA total of 564 holes from the 2020 and 2021 Programs were included in the current resource. The QP is of the opinion\nthat the sample preparation, analysis, QA/QC, and security protocols used for the Cariboo Gold Project follow\ngenerally accepted industry standards, and that the data is valid. The QP recommends the implementation of QA/QC\non the silver assay results for future programs.\nData Verification\nThe QPs verified the ODV diamond drill hole databases used for the 2022 MRE (the \"ODV Databases\") and reviewed\nand validated geological models of each deposit, and reviewed information on mined-out areas and the data for\nselected drill holes (assays, QA/QC program, downhole surveys, lithologies, alteration, and structures). The QP also\nreviewed and validated the resource estimation process followed by Daniel Downton, P.Geo., of ODV, including all\nparameters, geological interpretation, basic statistics, variography, interpolation parameters, block model\nconstruction, scripts that run the model, volumetric report, and the validation process.\nThe ODV Databases contain the 4,064 completed and validated diamond drills holes used for the 2022 FS MRE for\nthe Cariboo Gold Project. They are divided among four databases covering the eight deposits as follows:\n• Cow Mountain database for the Cow and Valley deposits (1,473 holes);\n• Island Mountain database for the Shaft and Mosquito deposits (1,851 holes);\n• Barkerville Mountain database for the BC Vein and Splays, the KL, and the Lowhee deposits (578\nholes);\n• Bonanza Ledge database (162 holes).\nSince the 2020 MRE, no drilling has been carried out on the KL, BC Vein, and the Bonanza Ledge deposits. The block\nmodel completed for the 2020 MRE for the Bonanza Ledge deposit as published in the 2020 technical report remains\ncurrent for the 2022 FS MRE. The block model completed for the BC Vein deposit for the 2022 Mineral Resource\nEstimate dated May 17, 2022 (the \"2022 PEA MRE\") remains current for the 2022 FS MRE. Other block models for\nthe remaining six (6) deposits were updated.\nA site visit was conducted from November 1 to 5, 2021 by the QP, Vincent Nadeau-Benoit. The site visit included a\nvisit and review of the core logging facilities, drill pads, and mineralized outcrops. The QP also examined core samples\nfrom drill holes from the 2020 Program and 2021 Program. Core logging and sampling procedures were discussed\nwith ODV's geologists. Discussions covered collar locations, drilling protocols, downhole surveys, logging protocols,\noriented core, structural measurements, sampling protocols and QA/QC protocols. Nadeau-Benoit, QP, is of the\nopinion that the site visit and validation exercises demonstrated the validity of the protocols in place and their use\nduring the 2020 Program and 2021 Program.\nCarl Pelletier, QP, also previously conducted site visits; from February 1 to 4, 2016, and from May 3 to 12, 2016. The\nfirst included the Bonanza Ledge pit, the Cow Mountain area, and the Island Mountain area. The second involved a\nvisit to the core logging facilities and several drill hole collars.\nMineral Resource Estimate\nThe 2022 Feasibility Mineral Resource Estimate for the Cariboo Gold Project (the \"2022 FS MRE\") encompasses\nupdated resources for the deposits of Cow Mountain (Cow Zone and Valley Zone), Island Mountain (Shaft Zone and\nMosquito Zone), and Barkerville Mountain (Lowhee Zone and KL Zone). The updates were prepared by Daniel\nDownton, P.Geo., of ODV, and reviewed and validated by Carl Pelletier, P.Geo., and Vincent Nadeau-Benoit, P.Geo.,\nboth of InnovExplo, using all available information. Since the 2022 PEA MRE, no new gold assay results were added\nPage C-16\nto the databases for the Mosquito, Cow, and KL Zone deposits, but gold resources in a dilution halo and silver\nmineralization estimates in the vein corridors were added to the models. No changes are reported for the Bonanza\nLedge or BC Vein (Barkerville Mountain) deposits. To report the 2022 FS MRE for the Cariboo Gold Project,\nconceptual \"potential mining shapes\" were used as constraints to demonstrate mineralized continuity and to show that\nthe \"reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction\" criteria is met, as defined in the CIM Definition Standards\non Mineral Resources and Reserves and the CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice\nGuidelines. The Mineral Resource updates for Shaft, Valley, and Lowhee Zones include new information from the\nend of the 2021 exploration program. The dilution halos and silver estimate additions contain data from all previous\ndrilling campaigns, including previously validated historic information.\nThe 2022 FS MRE covers all the deposits in the Cow-Island-Barkerville Mountain Corridor. The resource area for the\nCow Mountain/Island Mountain segment covers a strike length of 3.7 km and a width of approximately 700 m, down\nto a vertical depth of 600 m below surface. The estimate for the Barkerville Mountain segment covers a strike length\nof 3 km and a width of approximately 700 m, down to a vertical depth of 500 m below surface.\nTwo diamond drill hole databases cover the Cariboo Gold Project: Bonanza Ledge and BM-CM-IM (Barkerville\nMountain including the BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee deposits, Cow Mountain including the Cow and Valley deposits,\nand Island Mountain including the Shaft and Mosquito deposits). These databases were filtered by deposit (Cow,\nShaft, Valley, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, or Lowhee) before the work in Datamine. A subset of drill holes was used to\ngenerate the 2022 FS MRE database for each deposit, as follows:\n• The Cow deposit contains 1,219 validated drill holes;\n• The Valley deposit contains 254 validated drill holes;\n• The Shaft deposit contains 1,010 validated drill holes;\n• The Mosquito deposit contains 641 validated drill holes;\n• The Lowhee deposit contains 113 validated drill holes;\n• The BC Vein and KL Zone deposits contain 420 validated drill holes.\nThe QP data verification included the ODV Databases used for the 2022 FS MRE, as well as the review and validation\nof the geological models of each deposit, the review of information on mined-out areas, and the data for selected drill\nholes (assays, QA/QC program, downhole surveys, lithologies, alteration and structures).\nThe QPs also reviewed and validated the resource estimation process followed by ODV, including all parameters,\ngeological interpretation, basic statistics, variography, interpolation parameters, block model construction, scripts that\nrun the model, volumetric report, and the validation process.\nHistorical work subject to verification consisted of the holes used for the 2022 PEA MRE. Basic cross-check routines\nwere performed between the current ODV Databases and the previously validated database for the 2022 PEA MRE.\nThe QPs were granted access to the assay certificates for all holes in the 2021 drilling programs. Assays were verified\nfor 5% of the drill holes. No discrepancies were found.\nOverall, the QPs data verification demonstrates that the data, protocols, and estimation process for the Cariboo Gold\nProject are acceptable. The QPs consider the ODV databases to be valid and of sufficient quality to be used for the\nMineral Resource Estimate herein.\nODV updated, in 2022, the geological models for the Valley, Shaft, and Lowhee deposits using historical data, the\ndata from the 2015–2019 drilling programs, and new holes from the 2020–2021 drilling programs. The KL and BC\nVein deposit were not drilled in 2021 and the Mosquito and Cow deposits had no new data since the May 17, 2022\nPage C-17\nupdate, though the geological models were reviewed by the QPs. The Bonanza Ledge geological model, initially from\nBrousseau et al. (2017), was reviewed and validated by the QPs.\nA total of 482 geological solids were created and/or updated for all the deposits.\nThe QPs have classified the 2022 FS MRE as Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources based on data\ndensity, search ellipse criteria, drill hole density, and interpolation parameters. The 2022 FS MRE is considered to be\nreliable and established on quality data and geological knowledge. The Mineral Resource Estimate follows the 2014\nCIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves.\nTable 1 displays the results from the 2022 FS MRE, exclusive of the reserves, for the Cariboo Gold Project for all\neight deposits: Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, KL, Lowhee, BC Vein, and Bonanza Ledge.\nTable 1: Cariboo Gold Project 2022 FS MRE Reported at a 2.0 g/t Au Cut-Off Grade\n(Except for Bonanza Ledge Reported at a 3.5 g/t Au Cut-Off Grade)\nTonne Au Grade Au Ounce Ag Grade Ag Ounce\nCategory Deposit '000 (Au g/t) '000 (Ag g/t) '000\nMeasured Bonanza Ledge 47 5.06 8\nBonanza Ledge 32 4.02 4\nBC Vein 1,030 3.12 103\nKL 386 3.18 39\nLowhee 1,368 3.18 140 0.23 10\nIndicated\nMosquito 1,288 3.68 152 0.08 3\nShaft 4,781 3.39 523 0.06 9\nValley 2,104 3.14 213 0.09 6\nCow 3,644 3.31 388 0.09 11\nTotal Indicated Mineral Resources 14,635 3.32 1,564 0.09 39\nBC Vein 461 3.55 53\nKL 1,918 2.75 169\nLowhee 445 3.34 48 0.10 1\nInferred Mosquito 1,290 3.55 147 0.01 0\nShaft 6,468 3.84 800 0.01 1\nValley 2,119 3.30 225 0.02 1\nCow 2,769 3.03 270 0.00 0\nTotal Measured and Indicated 14,682 3.33 1,571 0.09 39\nMineral Resources\nTotal Inferred Mineral Resources 15,470 3.44 1,712 0.01 4\nMineral Resource Estimate notes:\n(1) The independent and qualified persons for the Mineral Resource Estimates, as defined by NI 43-101, are Carl Pelletier, P.Geo., and Vincent\nNadeau Benoit, P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.). The effective date of the 2022 FS MRE is November 11, 2022.\n(2) These Mineral Resources, exclusive of the reserves, are not Mineral Reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n(3) The Mineral Resource Estimate follows the 2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves and the 2019 CIM Estimation\nof Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines.\n(4) A total of 481 vein zones were modelled for the Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley), Island Mountain (Shaft and Mosquito), Barkerville\nMountain (BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee) deposits and one gold zone for Bonanza Ledge. A minimum true thickness of 2.0 m was applied, using\nthe gold grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed.\n(5) The estimate is reported for a potential underground scenario at a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au, except for Bonanza Ledge at a cut-off grade of\n3.5 g/t Au. The cut-off grade for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee deposits was calculated using a gold price of\nUS$1,700/oz; a USD: CAD exchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $54.32/t; a processing and transport cost of $22.29/t; a G&A plus\nEnvironmental cost of $15.31/t; and a sustaining CapEx cost of $31.19/t. The cut-off grade for the Bonanza Ledge deposit was calculated\nusing a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $79.13/t; a processing and transport cost of\nPage C-18\n$65.00/t; and a G&A plus Environmental cost of $51.65/t. The cut-off grades should be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing market\nconditions (metal prices, exchange rate, mining cost, etc.).\n(6) Density values for Cow, Shaft, Lowhee, and BC Vein were estimated using the inverse distance squared interpolation method, with a value\napplied for the non-estimated blocks of 2.80 g/cm3 for Cow, 2.78 g/cm3 for Shaft, 2.74 g/cm3 for Lowhee, and 2.69 g/cm3 for BC Vein.\nMedian densities were applied for Valley (2.81 g/cm3), Mosquito (2.79 g/cm3), and KL (2.81 g/cm3). A density of 3.20 g/cm3 was applied\nfor Bonanza Ledge.\n(7) A four-step capping procedure was applied to composited data for Cow (3.0 m), Valley (1.5 m), Shaft (2.0 m), Mosquito (2.5 m), BC Vein\n(2.0 m), KL (1.75 m), and Lowhee (1.5 m). Restricted search ellipsoids ranged from 7 g/t Au to 50 g/t Au at four different distances ranging\nfrom 25 m to 250 m for each deposit. High-grades at Bonanza Ledge were capped at 70 g/t Au on 2.0 m composited data.\n(8) The gold Mineral Resources for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee vein zones were estimated using Datamine\nStudioTM RM 1.9 software, using hard boundaries on composited assays. The silver Mineral Resources and the dilution halo gold\nmineralization were estimated using Datamine StudioTM RM Pro 1.11. The Ordinary Kriging (\"OK\") method was used to interpolate a sub-\nblocked model (parent block size = 5 m x 5 m x 5 m). Mineral Resources for Bonanza Ledge were estimated using GEOVIA GEMSTM 6.7\nsoftware using hard boundaries on composited assays. The OK method was used to interpolate a block model (block size = 2 m x 2 m x 5 m).\n(9) Results are presented in situ. Ounce (troy) = metric tons x grade / 31.10348. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes, g/t, etc.). The\nnumber of tonnes was rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects. Rounding followed the\nrecommendations as per NI 43-101.\n(10) The qualified persons responsible for the MRE section of the Cariboo Technical Report are not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal,\ntitle, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate.\nMineral Reserve Estimate\nMineral Reserves were classified in compliance with the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral\nReserves. As such, the Mineral Reserves are based on Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources and do not include\nany Inferred Mineral Resources. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are exclusive of proven and probable\nreserves. Mineral Reserves are the estimated tonnage and grade of ore that is considered economically viable for\nextraction. Mineral Reserves for the Cariboo Gold Project deposit incorporate dilution and mining recovery factors\nbased on the selected mining method and design. In addition, economic analyses were completed to validate the\nprofitability of particular areas of the reserves. The following sources of information were instrumental in the Mineral\nReserve estimation process: the resource blocks model (last updated September 8, 2022); the 2022 PEA MRE; the\ncurrent 3D model of existing underground workings and historical stope outlines; the litho-structural model of the\nsite.\nThe different cut-off grade calculations are based on parameters from benchmarks derived from the previous 2022\nPEA MRE, as well as ODV and InnovExplo estimates. Due to the variation in metallurgical recoveries along the\ndeposit, four cut-off grades were used for the stope optimization. The parameters used in these calculations are\nsummarized in Table 2.\nPage C-19\nTable 2: Cut-Off Grade Calculation Parameters\nPhase 1 (1,500 tpd) Phase 2 (4,900 tpd)\nGeneral Marginal General Marginal\nEconomic blocks at Economic blocks at\nInput Parameters Assessment vicinity Assessment vicinity\nGold Price $US/oz 1,700 1,700 1,700 1,700\nExchange Rate $CAD/$US 1.27 1.27 1.27 1.27\nRoyalty % 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00%\nRefining Cost $/oz 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0\nProcessing Cost and transport $/t treated 66.34 66.34 22.29 22.29\nMetallurgical Recovery % 92.30% 92.30% 92.10% 92.10%\nMining Recovery % 94.00% 94.00% 94.00% 94.00%\nMining Dilution % 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00%\nMining Cost $/t treated 71.90 71.90 54.32 54.32\nSustaining Cost $/t treated 50.00 0.00 31.19 0.00\nEnvironment $/t treated 14.45 14.45 4.93 4.93\nGeneral and Administration $/t treated 17.35 17.35 10.38 10.38\nCut-Off Grade g/t 4.00 3.10 2.30 1.70\nTable 3: Cariboo Gold Statement of Mineral Reserves as of December 6, 2022\nContained\nTonnage Grade Gold Grade Contained Silver\nCategory (t) Au (g/t) (oz) Ag (g/t) (oz)\nProven\n- - - - - -\nProbable\nCow 4 126 955 3.41 452 941 0.08 11 018\nValley 3 444 914 3.70 409 887 0.14 15 059\nShaft 7 962 448 3.87 989 757 0.02 4 473\nMosquito 602 591 4.93 95 479 0.03 619\nLowhee 566 547 4.56 83 088 0.21 3 786\nTotal P & P 16,703,454 3.78 2,031,152 0.07 34,955\nNotes:\n(1) The Qualified Person for the Mineral Reserve Estimate is Eric Lecomte, P.Eng.

The external dilution is estimated to be 8%. The\naverage mining recovery factor was set at 93.6% to account for mineralized material left in each block in the margins of the deposit.\nMining Methods\nThe Cariboo Gold Project consists of three main zones (Cow, Shaft, and Valley) with two smaller satellite zones\n(Lowhee and Mosquito). The rate of exploitation of each deposit will change over time, while the overall steady state\nPage C-20\nproduction rate is 4,900 tpd. In 2024, production will begin at 1,500 tpd (pending permitting) for 2.75 years and will\nramp up to 4,900 tpd (pending permitting) in 2027 for 8.5 years.\nThe selected mining method is mainly long hole longitudinal retreat with some stopes using a modified long hole\nlongitudinal retreat method. Primary materials handling fleet will comprise of 10 tonne Load Haul Dump (\"LHD\")\nand 50 t haul trucks.\nPre-production of the underground workings is set to begin in 2023 with 1,500 tpd achieved in September 2024 and\nfull production of 4,900 tpd at the Mine Site Complex (\"MSC\") in Q4 2027. Underground mine life is set to last until\nJanuary 2036.\nA hydrogeological investigation program was completed to provide key groundwater related inputs to the FS, namely,\nto estimate potential mine dewatering rates, to understand further the regional groundwater flow regime, and to\ncharacterize potential impacts of mine dewatering on groundwater and surface water systems.\nGeotechnical Evaluation\nSRK undertook two geotechnical field investigation programs on the Cariboo Gold Project designed to characterize\nthe rock geotechnical conditions and support the underground mine and infrastructure designs. These investigations\nalso supported structural geology reviews, detailed evaluation of geotechnical design domains, and the development\nof geotechnical design guidelines within each of these domains. These guidelines included excavation design\nparameters, estimates of dilution, as well as support requirements.\nThe 2018 geotechnical field data acquisition program included drilling and logging of 13 dedicated geotechnical drill\nholes. The 2021 geotechnical field data acquisition program included drilling and logging of five dedicated\ngeotechnical drill holes. During both programs, representative rock core samples from each geotechnical domain were\ncollected from the geotechnical drill holes for laboratory testing.\nA review of photographs taken of exploration drill holes was undertaken from 2020 to 2022 to build a broader\ngeotechnical understanding of the rock mass conditions across the Cariboo Gold Project site to optimize the\ngeotechnical design. A total of 83,047 m of photo-logging has been conducted to date.\nIn addition to the 3D structural model created by ODV to represent the major Regional Fault structures on the Cariboo\nGold Project property, SRK also provided a 3D fault model that was created for the secondary structures.\nThe geotechnical evaluation focused on a qualitative drill-hole-based assessment of the rock mass forming the\nimmediate hanging wall and footwall of the proposed mineable stopes in each vein. Planned stopes in each major vein\ncorridor, in each mining zone were individually assessed based on the lithology logging data provided by ODV, the\nregional structural model provided by ODV, the secondary structural model provided by SRK, the current\nunderstanding of existing historic mine workings, the geotechnical data acquired from the field program, and\nqualitative photographic review of drill holes intercepting the planned stopes.\nExcavation stability assessments have been completed using well-established empirical and semi-empirical\nrelationships and engineering experience. The design procedure involves two steps: the quality of the rock mass is\nrated using a pre-defined classification system, and then the expected performance of the underground openings is\npredicted using an empirically derived stability correlation with the rock mass quality.\nSub-level open stoping with a sub-level spacing of 30 m is achievable in rock mass Class 1 to Class 3 lower by varying\nthe open strike length and the use of two-phase backfill in the Class 3 lower rock mass in the Shaft Zone where stope\nwidths are less than 5 m.\nMining Method Description\nThe long hole mining method was primarily selected due to the sub vertical geometry of mineralized vein corridors\nand the relatively lower cost. This method involves driving two drifts longitudinally along the mineralized vein\nPage C-21\ncorridors to define a stope. The top access serves as a drilling platform while the bottom access allows for mucking\nof drilled then blasted material. Once empty, these stopes are then backfilled with either paste fill or cemented rockfill.\nStopes are mined retreating towards the access. This method allows for simultaneous mining of stopes along different\nvein corridors as well as along the same corridor if a pillar exists between active levels. A modified longitudinal\nmethod will also be used to a lesser extent (10% of the tonnage). That method essentially follows the same approach\nas the first one, except that the mucking and backfilling are done in two steps to limit the size of the exposed walls.\nThis method will only be used for stopes located in poor ground during Phase 2, since paste backfill is required.\nThe minimum designed stope width for all zones is 3.7 m and the sill to sill stope height for all zones is 30 m. The\nmaximum permissible strike length (the distance along strike that can be mined before backfilling is required) is a\nfunction of geotechnical constraints and differs by zone.\nMine Design\nThere will be two portals accessing underground ramps. The Cow Portal will allow access to the Lowhee, Shaft, and\nMosquito zones in the earlier stages of the Cariboo Gold Project. The Valley portal will be built during the expansion\nto develop the Main ramp connecting the previous zones to the new Cow and Valley Zones. The Valley Portal will be\nused as the main services access. The zones are accessed by main ramps connecting to haulage drifts, and each\nindividual zone has an internal ramp system. The Mosquito Zone is further west, connected to Shaft Zone by a 1,150\nm long haulage drift.\nEach zone is planned to be mined with the longitudinal retreat long hole method, except for the Shaft Zone and\nMosquito Zone that will be mined using both mining methods. Sublevels for all zones are 30 m sill to sill and a\ncombination of Cemented Rock Fill and paste fill are planned to backfill mined stopes. Stope strike lengths vary by\nzone based on geotechnical assessments of each zone. All zones are capped by a crown pillar (15 m for Cow and\nValley and 20 m for Shaft and Mosquito) and vary in depth.\nUnderground Infrastructure\nA major piece of underground infrastructure for the Phase 2 of the Cariboo Gold Project is the underground crushing\nsystem. This crusher is located below the services building in a location that has been identified as geotechnically\nfavourable for long-term infrastructure. Ore will be brought to the crusher by underground trucks from all mining\nzones.\nOre will ultimately be brought to surface using a vertical conveyor to be pre-concentrated by sorting and flotation.\nThe material rejected by the sorter will be transferred back underground using a wastepass raise and then it will either\nbe used as backfill material or hauled to the Bonanza Ledge Waste Rock Storage Facility (\"WRSF\") using automated\ntrucks.\nThe mine will include haulage drifts connecting the five separate zones, an underground garage, and pumping stations.\nThe Valley Portal will provide access for material and the labour force.\nDevelopment Schedule\nThe development schedule has been created with a combination of traditional jumbo development and roadheaders.\nThe roadheaders are scheduled to provide a lateral advance of 200 m per month in single heading conditions and will\nbe concentrated on the ramps and level access development. The jumbos will provide an average overall lateral\nadvance of 300 m per month per jumbo crew when multiple active headings are available. Lateral development will\nrely on contractors for the initial pre-production phase, with a handover to mine personnel with the initiation of\nproduction.\nElectrical Distribution and Networks\nDuring Phase 1, electrical power will be delivered to the mine through the Cow Portal from a 13.8 kilovolt (\"kV\")\noverhead power line originating from Bonanza Ledge Site. At Phase 2, power will be delivered from the main\nPage C-22\nelectrical room at the MSC to Valley Portal, while the power connection at Cow Portal will remain as a redundant\npower connection. Underground substations will transform the power to 600 volt (\"V\") or 1,000 V depending on need\nor equipment to be supplied.\nFiber optics will be used to provide a data backbone to the mine. The mine network will then rely on 4G provided by\nradiant cables. This will allow for communication, automation of equipment, as well as ventilation-on-demand.\nMine Automation and Monitoring Systems\nThe layout of mine levels was designed to facilitate the automation of mucking and hauling. Each level will have one\nload out, which will allow for tele-remote loading of haulage trucks or loading of dumped waste material. Automation,\nor tele-operation of haulage trucks will be limited to dedicated drift or between shifts only. Automation and tele-\nremote for LHD will be available any time as production levels will be isolated with barricades. By the end of 2027,\nall mucking operation on the production levels will be fully automated, with one operator for two LHD's.\nPermanent Mine Pumping Network\nThe mine dewatering network was designed to handle 10,666 cubic metres per day. This system will also contribute\nto the dewatering of historic excavations.\nVentilation\nThe ventilation system has been designed to comply with British Columbia regulations. The airflow required to\nventilate diesel engines was compiled using a 0.06 cubic metres per second / kW rate.\nThe system will be comprised of four independent intake fresh air raises, one exhaust raise and remaining exhaust\nthrough the main ramps and the Cow Portal. The total estimated airflow required to meet production is 715,000 cubic\nfeet per minute (337 cubic metres per second).\nProduction Rate\nBeginning in 2024, the total production rate will be 1,500 tpd (Phase 1), ramping up in 2027 to 4,900 tpd (Phase 2)\n(ore), with each zone contributing a different ratio to production over time.\nProduction Plan\nThe LOM has a 12-year mine life at maximum production rates from 1,500 tpd to 4,900 tpd. Production ramps-up to\nsteady state of 4,900 tpd is achievable by the end of 2027, the third production year, with completion of the flotation\ncircuit. The overall mine plan comprises 16.7 Mt of ore that will be processed with an average grade of 3.8 g/t Au.\nThe mine will produce 7.1 Mt of waste from the development over the LOM.\nPage C-23\nTable 4: Ore Produced Per Year\nYear 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029\nt 4,823 178,373 382,498 854 - - -\nLowhee\ng/t 4.37 4.68 4.51 5.19 - - -\nt - - - - - 87,289 315,430\nCow\ng/t - - - - - 3.55 4.05\nt - - - 4,615 8,503 163,792 164\nValley Upper\ng/t - - - 3.09 4.00 3.16 1.70\nt - - - - - 200 170,592\nValley Lower\ng/t - - - - - 4.36 4.11\nt - - 155,885 535,687 676,495 1,308,353 1,302,626\nShaft\ng/t - - 4.48 4.37 3.54 3.53 3.79\nt - - - 8,368 358,879 235,344 -\nMosquito\ng/t - - - 4.34 5.31 4.36 -\nYear 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036\nt - - - - - - -\nLowhee\ng/t - - - - - - -\nt 102,785 108,332 111,743 424,534 1,431,941 1,520,129 24,774\nCow\ng/t 4.28 3.86 2.67 3.59 3.39 3.21 3.20\nt 73,178 55,075 401,230 333,481 - - -\nValley Upper\ng/t 3.35 3.66 3.63 3.57 - - -\nt 413,547 733,222 670,563 307,727 86,442 22,581 -\nValley Lower\ng/t 4.30 3.69 3.69 3.50 3.35 3.02 -\nt 1,200,306 891,828 611,251 723,113 271,700 248,599 36,605\nShaft\ng/t 4.23 4.07 3.91 3.85 3.50 3.41 3.09\nt - - - - - - -\nMosquito\ng/t - - - - - - -\nMine Equipment and Personnel\nDuring pre-production, all development will be conducted by contractors. These contractors will provide the\nequipment used to develop lateral advance except for the roadheaders. ODV will take over the development and\nproduction work at the beginning of the production phase, gradually integrating its own equipment according to the\nneeds of the operation.\nThe mine will operate 365 days/year with three different rosters for office and hourly personnel. A total of 298\nemployees related to underground mining for operation and maintenance services for Phase 2 are anticipated in Wells.\nMineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing\nA preliminary metallurgical testwork program was previously undertaken to determine the metallurgical response on\nsamples prepared from drill holes obtained from the Shaft, Cow, and Valley deposits. The testwork consisted of an\ninvestigation into the amenability of mineral sorting to pre-concentrate the run of mine prior to milling, chemical\ncharacterization, a preliminary evaluation of comminution characteristics, a series of gravity, flotation and leaching\ntests, cyanide destruction testing, as well as preliminary thickening and rheology tests. The average metallurgical\nrecovery per site is reported in Table 5 below. Based on testwork results and the proposed mine plan at the time, the\noverall projected gold recovery is 92.0%. The annual recovery projections are expected to differ from the average\ntestwork results according to the final mine proportions of ore zones.\nPage C-24\nTable 5: Average Gold Recovery and Process Step\nProcess Step Average Au Stage Recovery (%)\nBonanza Site 96.3\nMine Site Complex 95.3\nQR Mill – Phase 1 96.6\nQR Mill – Phase 2 96.5\nOverall Au Recovery – Phase 1 93.0\nOverall Au Recovery – Phase 2 91.9\nOverall Au Recovery - LOM 92.0\nAdditional testwork on samples from the Lowhee deposit was performed during and after the 2022 PEA. The testwork\non samples from the Shaft, Cow and Valley Zones consisted of metallurgical testing on ore sorting test products, an\nextended gravity recoverable test, a series of flotation and cyanide leaching testing, a feasibility past fill test, as well\nas a final dewatering and rheology test. The latest testwork program was completed to characterize and understand\nthe metallurgical response of materials from the Lowhee deposit. The latest testwork included ore sorting tests,\ncomminution tests, leaching tests, and cyanide destruction tests. In addition to metallurgical testing, paste backfill test\nresults are summarized in the Cariboo Technical Report. Paste backfill testwork programs were completed to\ncharacterize ore sorter tailings and flotation tailings, to design the paste system, and to determine the backfill strategy.\nTestwork data from the 2022 PEA, and new testwork with effective date on November 15, 2022 was considered for\nthe process design.\nRecovery Methods\nThe Cariboo Gold Project will ramp up tonnage in two phases, Phase 1 starting with a 1,500 tpd ore sorting and\nleaching flowsheet, followed by Phase 2 with a 4,900 tpd ore sorting, flotation, and leaching flowsheet.\nIn the first phase, the ore will be processed in two stages at two sites: the Bonanza Ledge Site located at the current\nBonanza Ledge Mine, and the QR Mill located 111 km from the MSC.\nFor the initial throughput, during Phase 1, of 1,500 tpd, a pre-concentrator, including mobile crushing and ore sorting,\nwill be built at the Bonanza Ledge Site. The use of the Bonanza Ledge Site will reduce the overall operation and\ntransportation costs. The crushing operation will consist of a two-stage crushing and screening. The crushed product\nwill be processed in an ore sorting circuit. The concentrate from the sorted concentrate will be crushed and then\ntrucked to the QR Mill for further comminution, leaching, and refining.\nThe QR Mill is an existing plant under care and maintenance with a daily capacity to treat 860 t of ore. The QR Mill\nwill require refurbishment of some areas before start-up. A filtration plant will be added to produce dry tailings.\nIn Phase 2, the ore will be processed in two stages at two sites: the MSC and the QR Mill located 111 km west of the\nMSC.\nFor the expanded throughput of 4,900 tpd, crushing will occur underground and will then be conveyed to the surface,\nwhere ore sorting, grinding and flotation will be conducted in a services building at the MSC. The MSC services\nbuilding will serve as a pre-concentration step to reduce the overall operation and transportation costs. The primary\ncrushing operation will be located underground, and the crushed product will be conveyed to the surface to feed a\nsizing screen. The sizing screen undersize will be discharged into a fine storage bin and the oversize will be sent to\nthe ore sorting circuit. The sorted concentrate will be combined with the fine storage bin material to feed a grinding\nand flotation circuit. The flotation concentrate will be trucked to the QR Mill for further comminution, leaching, and\nrefining.\nThe QR Mill will be upgraded to process the higher concentrate feed grades in the second phase. Carbon in leach and\nthe ADR circuit will be replaced and the refinery will be upgraded.\nPage C-25\nInfrastructure, Permitting and Compliance Activities\nProject Infrastructure\nThe Cariboo Gold Project will include the following infrastructure:\nPhase 1\nBonanza Ledge\n• First phase of the WRSF;\n• Surface water management infrastructure;\n• Fuel systems (liquified natural gas and diesel storage and distribution);\n• Natural gas power plant;\n• Ore crushing and sorting facility;\nQR Mill\n• Upgrades to the QR Mill to process ore sorting concentrate and a new tailings dewatering circuit;\n• Filtered stack tailings storage facility;\n• Water management infrastructure;\n• Relocation and upgrade of the propane system;\n• Improvements to the fire protection system.\nOffsite Infrastructure\n• Construction of an Integrated Remote Operational Centre.\nPhase 2\nMine Site Complex\n• Access roads, bridge, parking lots, security facilities and access gates;\n• Mine surface infrastructure including a portal and mine ventilation and heating infrastructure;\n• Concentrator;\n• Office complex including office space and mine dry facilities;\n• Surface water management infrastructure;\n• MSC water treatment plant and treated effluent discharge line;\n• Fuel systems (liquified natural gas and diesel storage and distribution)\nPage C-26\n• 66 kV to 13.8 kV electrical substation;\n• Site electrical distribution and lighting;\n• Fiber optic network;\n• Firewater pumping station and distribution piping system;\n• Potable water well, treatment plant and distribution system;\n• Sewage treatment system.\nBonanza Ledge\n• Second phase of the WRSF and associated surface water management infrastructure.\nQR Mill\n• Upgrades to the QR Mill to process high-grade flotation concentrate from the concentrator at the\nMSC;\n• Information technology and telecom upgrade to support remote process monitoring;\n• Potable water treatment plant and distribution system;\n• Sewage treatment system.\nOffsite Infrastructure\n• 66 kV power line connecting BC Hydro's Barlow substation to the MSC 66 kV/13.8 kV substation;\n• Increase the number of rooms for worker accommodations;\n• Final expansion of the Integrated Remote Operational Centre in Quesnel.\nEnvironmental and Permitting\nRegulatory Context and Environmental Studies\nAn Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") for the Cariboo Gold Project was initiated with the submission and acceptance\nof an Initial Project Description in 2020, as per the BCEAA, at a production rate of 4,750 tpd. Submission of the\nrevised application occurred in October 2022, and acceptance to the Effects Assessment Phase was issued by the\nEnvironmental Assessment Office of British Columbia on November 30, 2022. Issuance of an Environmental\nAssessment Certificate (\"EAC\") is expected after the successful review of the application.\nAs part of the EA Application for the Cariboo Gold Project, site-specific environmental baseline modelling and\nexisting conditions characterization has been ongoing since 2016, with updates made to various reports following\ncomments from the Technical Advisory Committee, the Participating Indigenous nations and the Community\nAdvisory Committee. ODV has prepared a preliminary list of key provincial and federal authorizations, licenses, and\npermits that may be required for the Cariboo Gold Project, following the EA process. The QR Mill and Bonanza\nLedge, constituent parts of the Cariboo Gold Project, are authorized under separate Mines Act and Environmental\nManagement Act permits, and each have their own associated reclamation bonding and liability estimates. Extensive\nbaseline data collection and monitoring occurred as part of permit amendment applications for these sites, and\nPage C-27\nmonitoring data continues to be collected in support of site-specific environmental management and permit\nrequirements.\nEnvironmental baseline studies and modelling for the Cariboo Gold Project have been undertaken in the following\nareas: air quality, terrain and soils, vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat, climate and physiography, fisheries and\naquatic resources, surface water, and groundwater. In addition, ODV has established environmental monitoring plans\nfor a suite of valued components to respond to regulatory requirements and best management practices for the Cariboo\nGold Project.\nConsiderations of Social and Community Impacts\nSince 2016, ODV has been undertaking meaningful and transparent engagement with Indigenous nations, the public,\nlocal community members, provincial and local government agencies and other stakeholders, and this engagement is\nongoing. Positive relationships have been developed and maintained with three participating indigenous nations,\nLhtako Dené Nation, Xatśūll First Nation, Williams Lake First Nation, and ODV intends to maintain these\nrelationships through all phases of the Cariboo Gold Project.\nMine Reclamation and Closure Plan\nODV has prepared various RCP for the Cariboo Gold Project to detail how the sites will be reclaimed to a safe, stable,\nand non-polluting condition. An updated RCP was provided as an appendix to the EA for the Cariboo Gold Project.\nRCPs will continue to be updated as mine plans evolve, regulatory guidelines change, and in accordance with permit\nrequirements. The Cariboo Gold Project footprint at each site has been divided into Master Areas to reflect disturbance\ntype and proposed end land use. Detailed closure and reclamation prescriptions will be provided for each Master Area.\nPermitting and Required Approvals\nAs outlined above, the Cariboo Gold Project is currently undergoing an EA under the BCEAA given that it will have\na production capacity of > 75,000 tonnes per year of mineral ore. However, the Cariboo Gold Project is not subject to\nfederal review under the Impact Assessment Act as it does not exceed the relevant threshold specified in the Schedule\nof Physical Activities specified in the federal Physical Activities Regulations (SOR/2019-285. S. 18(c)).\nThe Cariboo Gold Project will require several permits, approvals and authorizations from provincial, federal and\nmunicipal agencies as summarized below.\nBC Environmental Assessment Regulations\nThe Cariboo Gold Project, proposed at a production rate of 4,750 tpd, is currently undergoing review as per the\nBCEAA (2018). Submission of the revised application was completed in October 2022 initiating the assessment phase,\nwith an expected issuance of an EAC in early 2023.\nFederal Permits, Approvals, Licenses and Authorizations\nBelow is a list of federal permits, approvals and authorizations that could potentially be applicable to the Cariboo Gold\nProject.\n• Fisheries Act Authorization\n• Migratory Birds Convention Act Authorization\n• Navigation Protection Program Notification and/or Approval\n• Species at Risk Act Authorization\n• Explosive Licenses and Permits\nPage C-28\n• Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulation\nProvincial Permits, Approvals and Licenses\nBelow is a list of provincial permits, approvals and licenses that could potentially be applicable to the Cariboo Gold\nProject.\n• Mines Act Permit\n• Effluent Discharge Permit\n• Emissions Discharge Permit\n• Refuse Permit and Waste Storage Approval\n• Heritage Conservation Act Permit\n• Heritage Conservation Act Concurrence Letters\n• License of Occupation\n• Statutory Right of Way\n• Wildlife Act Permit\n• Sewer System Regulation Approval\n• Construction Permit for a Potable Water Well\n• Water System Construction Permit\n• Drinking Water System Operations Permit\n• Short term Use of Water Permit (Water Sustainability Act, Section 10)\n• Change of Approval (for changes in and about a stream) (Water Sustainability Act, Section 11)\n• Water License (Diversion, storage, and use of water) (Water Sustainability Act, Sections 7 and 9)\n• Licenses to Cut and Special Use Permit\n• Industrial Access Permit\n• Permit for regulated activities\n• Explosives Magazine Storage and Use Permit\nIn addition, the Cariboo Gold Project is located in the jurisdiction of Cariboo Regional District and District of Wells.\nBoth jurisdictions have passed certain by-laws that may pertain to the Cariboo Gold Project activities / operations and\nproperty ownership or business operations.\nPage C-29\nCapital and Operating Costs Estimates\nCapital Costs\nThe total initial capital cost for the Cariboo Gold Project is estimated to be $137.3 million and the total expansion\ncapital cost is estimated to be $451.1 million. The overall capital cost estimate developed in the Cariboo Technical\nReport generally meets the American Association of Cost Engineers Class 3 requirements and has an accuracy range\nof between -10% and +15%. The capital cost estimate was compiled using mix of quotations and budgetary quotations,\ndatabase costs, and database factors.

Inflation or cost escalation factors were not taken into account. The base case gold price is\nUS$1,700/oz.\nThe economic analysis presented in this section contains forward-looking information with regards to the Mineral\nResource Estimates, commodity prices, exchange rates, proposed mine production plan, projected recovery rates,\noperating costs, construction costs, and project schedule. The results of the economic analysis are subject to a number\nPage C-32\nof known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from\nthose presented here.\nThe input parameters used and results of the financial analysis are presented in Table 9.\nThe pre-tax base case financial model resulted in an IRR of 24.4% and a NPV of $691M using a 5% discount rate.\nThe pre-tax payback period after start of operations is 5.8 years. On an after-tax basis, the base case financial model\nresulted in an IRR of 20.7% and a NPV of $502M using a 5% discount rate. The after-tax payback period after start\nof operations is 5.9 years. The AISC including royalties over the LOM are US$968.1/oz.\nTable 9: Financial Analysis Summary\nDescription Unit Value\nTotal Tonnes Mined M tonne (Mt) 16.7\nAverage Diluted Gold Grade g/t 3.78\nTotal Gold Contained oz 2,031,153\nTotal Gold Payable oz 1,868,856\nAverage Annual Gold Produced Au oz per year 163,695\nTotal Initial Capital Cost $M 137.3\nTotal Expansion Capital Cost $M 451.1\nSustaining Capital $M 466.6\nSite Reclamation Cost $M 17.3\nSalvage Value $M 56.2\nOperating Costs $/t mined 102.6\nAll-in Sustaining Costs USD/oz 968.1\nTotal LOM NSR Revenue $M 4,126\nLOM Royalties $M 206.3\nTotal LOM Pre-Tax Cash Flow $M 1,191.7\nAverage Annual Pre-tax Cash Flow $M 104.4\nLOM Taxes $M 290.6\nTotal LOM After-Tax Free Cash Flow $M 901.1\nAverage Annual After-Tax Free Cash Flow $M 78.9\nValuation Summary\nPre-Tax NPV (at 5% Discount Rate) $M 691\nPre-Tax IRR % 24.4\nPre-Tax Payback (after start of operations) year 5.8\nAfter-Tax NPV (at 5% Discount Rate) $M 502\nAfter-Tax IRR % 20.7\nAfter-Tax Payback (after start of operations) year 5.9\nNote:\n(1) Not including sunk costs ($2.5 million) and pre-permit expenses ($64.8 million) totalling $67.3 million.\nA financial sensitivity analysis was conducted on the Cariboo Gold Project's after tax NPV and IRR using the\nfollowing variables: capital cost (pre-production and sustaining) operating costs, USD:CAD exchange rate, and the\nprice of gold.\nThe graphical representations of the financial sensitivity analysis on NPV and IRR are depicted in Figure 2 and Figure\n3. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the USD:CAD exchange rate and gold price have the most significant influence\non both NPV and IRR compared to the other parameters, based on the range of values evaluated. After the USD:CAD\nexchange rates and gold price, NPV was most impacted by changes in operating costs and then, to a lesser extent,\nPage C-33\ncapital costs. It should be noted that the economic viability of the Cariboo Gold Project will not be significantly\nnegatively impacted by variations in the capital cost, within the margins of error associated with the FS capital cost\nestimate.\nAfter the USD:CAD exchange rates and gold price, the Cariboo Gold Project's IRR was most impacted by variation\nin capital costs, and to a lesser extent by the operating costs.\nOverall, the NPV and IRR of the Cariboo Gold Project are generally positive over most of the range of values used\nfor the sensitivity analysis when analyzed individually.\nFigure 2: After-Tax Sensitivity Analysis – Net Present Value (NPV)\nFigure 3: After-Tax Sensitivity Analysis – Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\nProject Schedule and Organization\nODV will assemble a team to manage the Cariboo Gold Project technical studies and the Cariboo Gold Project\nconstruction. All Project phases, including detailed engineering, procurement, pre-production, and construction\nactivities will be under the direction of the Chief Operating Officer of ODV. Permitting and Project financing will be\nsupported and performed by ODV's Project Development Team and Financial teams, respectively.\nPage C-34\nDuring Phase 1, the construction activities were planned in close coordination with pre-production activities with the\naim of respecting the existing lodging facilities in Wells and the existing camp at the QR Mill site. During Phase 2,\ngiven the substantially higher construction labour requirements at the MSC, the construction activities were planned\nto respect the new lodging capacity at Wells and the existing satellite facilities.\nThe preliminary on-site workforce requirement for construction, including infrastructure, concentrator, and\ndevelopment of the underground mine is expected to be 635 construction personnel to ramp up the Cariboo Gold\nProject to 4,900 tpd for 2027.\nThe implementation of Phase 2 will be undertaken in such a way as to turn over key process components of Phase 2\nduring Phase 1 progressively, so that the concurrent operation availability is not dramatically impacted. As an example,\nat the QR Mill site, the schedule to implement the new carbon in pulp (\"CIP\") circuit will be undertaken ahead of\ntime to enable the dismantlement of the existing CIP circuit of Phase 1 in the process building and allow for enough\ntime for the construction of the elution circuit at that same location. Similarly during Phase 2, the ore sorters at Bonanza\nLedge will be progressively dismantled and inserted in the services building at the MSC during ramp-up to minimize\nthe downtime of operations at QR Mill and the downtime of commissioning and ramp-up at the MSC.\nBased on the Cariboo Technical Report, pending the completion of all studies and receipt of the required permits, the\ndevelopment of Lowhee Zone is scheduled to begin in Q4 2023 while the concentrator and MSC infrastructure\nconstruction is scheduled to begin in Q3 2025 with full capacity production beginning in Q3 2027.

The Cariboo\nTechnical Report provides a summary of the results and findings from each major area of investigation. Standard\nindustry practices, equipment, and processes were used. To date, the QPs are not aware of any unusual or significant\nrisks or uncertainties that could materially affect the reliability or confidence in the Cariboo Gold Project based on the\ninformation available.\nThe results of the Cariboo Technical Report indicate that the proposed Cariboo Gold Project has technical and financial\nmerit using the base case assumptions. The QPs consider the FS results sufficiently reliable and recommend that the\nCariboo Gold Project be advanced to the next stage of development through the initiation of Phase 1 detailed\nengineering.\nThe following conclusions are based on the QPs detailed review of all pertinent information:\n• The results demonstrate the geological and grade continuities for all eight gold deposits in the Cow-\nIsland-Barkerville Mountain Corridor.\n• In a potential underground scenario, the Cariboo Gold Project contains an estimated Measured\nResource of 8,000 ounces of gold, and Indicated Resource of 3,463,000 ounces, and an Inferred\nResource of 1,621,000 ounces.\n• The resource estimates for the Mosquito, Shaft, Valley, Cow, and Lowhee deposits were updated\nusing the 2021 drill results. Additional diamond drilling on multiple zones would likely increase the\nInferred Resources and upgrade some of the Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources.\n• The selected flowsheet for processing material from the deposits includes mineral sorting, grinding,\nflotation and leaching. The process at the Mine Site Complex produces a pre-concentrate consisting\nPage C-36\nof mineral sorting concentrate in Phase I and in Phase II mineral sorting and flotation concentrate\nboth Phases concentrates are transported to the QR Mill for further milling and leaching. Based on\nthe testwork results and the proposed mining plan at the time, the overall projected Au recovery is\n92.0%.\n• The Cariboo Gold Project mine layout demonstrates a development intensive stope access\nrequirement and therefore has a high development meter per tonne of mineralized material ratio.\nThese factors may pose a challenge to successful implementation of the mine plan given the\nrestrictive geotechnical parameters and intrinsically lower productivities of the mining method.\nHowever, through diligent planning and adherence to proper work procedures, sufficient active\nheadings and stoping areas should meet daily production requirements.\n• The use of innovative technologies and techniques may improve productivity: Such as roadheaders,\nand the use of autonomous equipment.\n• The environmental baseline work completed to date is sufficient to support a FS. Further work is\nunderway, as required, to support the Environmental Assessment process and permit applications\nfor the Cariboo Gold Project.\n• The information and assumptions used in the design of the Mine Site Complex, Bonanza Ledge, and\nQR Mill infrastructure are sufficient to support a feasibility study. Further work is underway and\nrecommended to support subsequent design phases.\n• The total capital costs (initial, expansion and sustaining) for the Cariboo Gold Project were\nestimated at $1,055.0 million, and the average operating costs over the 12-year mine life is estimated\nto be $102.6/tonne mined. The AISC including royalties over the LOM are US$968.1/oz.\n• The financial analysis performed as part of the Cariboo Technical Report using the base case\nassumptions results in an after-tax NPV 5% of $502.4 million and an internal rate of return of 20.7%\n(base case exchange rate of 0.77 CAD for 1.00 USD). The cumulative cash flow for the Cariboo\nGold Project (after-tax) is $901.1 million and the payback period after start of operations is 5.9 years\nover the planned mine life of 12 years.\nThe QPs consider the FS to be reliable, thorough, based on quality data, reasonable hypotheses, and parameters\ncompliant with NI 43-101 requirements and CIM Definition Standards.\nRisks and Opportunities\nAn analysis of the results of the investigations has identified a series of risks and opportunities associated with each\nof the technical aspects considered for the development of the Cariboo Gold Project.\nPotential Risks\nThe most significant potential risks associated with the Cariboo Gold Project are:\n• The planned daily mining production rate may be difficult to achieve due to geological continuity\nissues, geotechnical issues, possible interaction of equipment, automation constraints, and other\npotential slowdowns resulting in a longer mining cycle time;\n• Greater water inflow than anticipated leading to an increase in water pumping and treatment capital\nand operational costs;\n• There is currently limited contingency storage if the water treatment system at the QR site is unable\nto operate or meet discharge criteria. A mitigation approach could include consideration of\nadditional contingency storage locations and maintaining pumping system redundancy;\nPage C-37\n• Tailings and paste management: Different distribution between ore sorting and flotation will make\nit harder to manage different streams. (Mitigation: old workings to help);\n• The inability to locate an appropriate borrow source for aggregate material near the Mine Site would\nincrease the cost and environmental impact of the Cariboo Gold Project due to transporting the\nmaterial over a greater distance;\n• Discovery of an unidentified contaminant that cannot be treated by the chosen mine water treatment\nsystems (complexity of contaminants) may lead to increased water treatment costs;\n• The inability, for technical or permitting reasons, to use the old underground galleries at BL as a\nflood management reservoir may lead to the need for an additional basin at surface, resulting in\nhigher capital costs and possible project delays.\nSeveral of the previous noted risks are common to most mining projects, many of which may be mitigated, at least to\nsome degree, with adequate engineering, planning, and pro-active management.\nKey Opportunities\nThere are several opportunities that could improve the economics, timing, and/or permitting potential of the Cariboo\nGold Project. The key opportunities that have been identified at this time are as follows:\n• Additional exploration surface definition diamond drilling could identify new resource areas and\nupgrade Inferred resources to the Indicated category;\n• The opportunity exists to examine alternative mining methods that could be considered in certain\nareas of the mine. In veins of sufficient width and continuity, the application of transverse longhole\nstoping could be considered which may allow for improved mine operations, lower capital and/or\noperating costs.\n• Additional geotechnical data will be collected during the Lowhee bulk sample and the underground\ndevelopment of Phase 1, including geotechnical mapping and underground geotechnical core\ndrilling. This information could result in design modifications with lower operating or capital costs.\n• A geometallurgical system should be implemented that would gather and analyse data collected\nduring definition drilling and mapping to collect geotechnical, rock mass, and mineralogical\nproperties. This should allow for the optimization of the mine sequence and cost structure to\nmaximize the economics of each individual stope within the life of mine;\n• There is a capital cost reduction opportunity to possibly mix non-potentially acid generating waste\nrock material with borrow pit aggregate for the construction of some of the civil and water\nmanagement infrastructure at the MSC;\n• Refinement of water quality model and additional hydrogeological investigations during Phase 1 of\nthe mine operations may allow for MSC water treatment plant design improvements potentially\nleading to lower capital and/or operating costs.\nRecommendations\nBased on the results of the 2022 FS, the QPs recommend that the Cariboo Gold Project move to an advanced phase of\ndevelopment which would involve detail engineering and that project execution activities commence at ODV's\ndiscretion.\nSpecifically, the QPs recommend continuing ODV's exploration program, completing the bulk sample, and various\npre-permitting activities (see below for details).\nPage C-38\nIt is recommended that the drilling (infill and exploration), geological mapping, and grab sampling test the extensions\nof known high-grade vein corridors and identify new targets.\nPage C-39\nThe recommended work program is detailed below:\n1. Exploration Work:\nBased on the results of the 2022 FS MRE, it is recommended that the Cariboo Gold Project deposit\nbe advanced to the next phase. Additional exploration and delineation drilling, as well as further\ngeological and structural interpretation are recommended to determine the extents of the gold\nmineralization. The recommended geology work program is detailed below. Infill drilling in high-\ngrade vein corridors (greater than 6.0 g/t Au) is recommended to convert resources currently\ncategorized as Inferred to the Indicated category. A budget of 130,000 m of drilling is recommended\nfor this program.\n2. Complete the bulk sample:\nUnderground bulk sampling program to test geological and grade continuities, metallurgical and\ngeotechnical parameters.\n3. Pre-permitting work:\nA budget for the proposed program was proposed to serve as a guideline for the Cariboo Gold\nProject. The budget is presented in Table 11 and amounts to a total budget of $114.8 million. The\nQPs believe the recommended work program and proposed expenditures are appropriate and well\nthought out, and that the proposed budget reasonably reflects the contemplated activities.\nAdditional recommendations and further details on those can be found in Chapter 26 of the Cariboo\nTechnical Report.\nTable 11: Work Program Budget\nCost Estimate\nWork Program ($ million)\nInfill and exploration drilling (130,000 m) 30.0\nSurface mapping and sampling 0.5\nBulk Sample 15.0\nPre-Permitting Work 57.2\n000-Mobile equipment 4.3\n200-Underground mine 3.1\n300-Water and waste management 21.9\n400-Electrical and communication 7.4\n500-Surface infrastructure 0.4\n600-Processing – Mine Site Complex 3.4\n600-Processing – QR Mill 4.7\n700-Construction indirect costs 12.0\nSub-Total 102.7\nContingency 12.1\nTotal 114.8\nPage C-40\nSCHEDULE \"D\"\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION – TINTIC PROJECT\nScientific and technical information relating to the Tintic Project located in Utah provided in this AIF is supported by\nand qualified in its entirety by the full text of the most recent technical report on the Tintic Project filed in accordance\nwith NI 43-101, titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report, Initial Mineral Resource Estimate for the Trixie Deposit, Tintic\nProject, Utah, United States of America\" dated January 27, 2023, with an effective date of January 10, 2023., being\nthe Tintic Technical Report, which was prepared, reviewed, and approved by William J.

The property on which the Trixie test mine or Trixie deposit is located encompasses most of the East\nTintic District, surrounding and immediately east of the incorporated town of Eureka. The township of Eureka is\nlocated approximately 6.4 km northwest of the Trixie test mine.\nThe coordinates of the center of the Project are 407,700mE and 4,423,400mN, referenced in NAD83, Northern UTM\nZone 12. The Project area is located on Eureka Quadrangle, U.S. Topographic Map 1:24,000 scale, 7.5 Minute Series.\nThe nearest rail siding, in use, is located at Tintic Junction, approximately 10 km west of the Project.\nPage D-1\nTintic Project Property Outline within the East Tintic District\nThe area of the Tintic Project owned or controlled by ODV comprises 1,105 claims totalling 5,746 ha (14,200 acres)\nof patented mining claims and a further 107 mining claims of approximately 1,214 ha (3,000 acres), which are\noverwhelmingly leased patented mining claims. ODV owns a small and varying percentage, interest or royalty in a\nnumber of other claims outside the main claim package.\nODV verified the status of the mineral title to certain patented mining claims by engaging UT legal counsel to conduct\na review of ODV's chain of title for the select patented mining claims within the land package covering approximately\n243 ha (600 acres) surrounding the Trixie and Burgin mines. UT legal counsel conducted their title review by\nexamining the United States Bureau of Land Management records, including the patents issued by the United States,\nmineral survey and master title plans, and the official records of the UT County Recorder's Office, including the\nabstract (tract), mining claims, and grantor/grantee indices, among miscellaneous other records. This consolidated\nland position has been acquired over a hundred years of prior consolidation in the District. The Corporation also\nengaged with Wolcott LLC, an independent consultant to conduct field checks and generate a geospatial database.\nOn May 30, 2022, ODV announced the Tintic Acquisition from IG Tintic LLC and CCMC for total consideration at\nclosing of approximately US$177 million in cash and shares of Osisko and:\n1.

These include the Trixie shaft and surface facilities. Full development of the Trixie test mine will\nrequire a number of additional Agency approvals, none of which is anticipated to be problematic to obtain. Pursuant\nto the Stream Agreement between TCM and Osisko Bermuda dated August 12, 2022, Osisko Bermuda has a first\nranking security interest over all of the present and future assets of TCM. TCM is a division of ODV.\nOther Significant Factors and Risks\nEffective upon the closing of the Acquisition, ODV's rights to use and access all surface and water rights conveyed to\nEmerald Hollow are governed by a Framework Agreement executed at closing and dated effective May 27, 2022 (the\n\"Framework Agreement\"). Under the Framework Agreement, ODV has the right to conduct exploration activities\nand has agreed easements to use the surface rights owned by Emerald Hollow. ODV also has the right to purchase\nPage D-3\nsurface rights from Emerald Hollow at market rates if it has reasonably determined that actual use and occupation of\nsuch lands for facilities for more than 18 months are necessary for economic exploitation of proven or probable\nreserves or measured, indicated, or inferred resources.\nODV has also retained a right of first offer in the event that Emerald Hollow desires to sell, assign, or otherwise\ntransfer to a third party all or a portion of its interest in the surface rights it owns, as well as a first priority right to\npurchase from Emerald Hollow, at a price based on prevailing market rates, a maximum annual water flow rate of\n2.45 cubic feet per second (cfs) and a maximum annual volume of 1,776.64 acre-feet of water from Emerald Hollow\nfor its mining activities.\nPermitting and Environmental Liabilities\nEnvironment\nTCM maintains adequate financial surety of approximately $7.4 million with the UT DOGM. This Financial surety\nwas last updated in 2023.\nTCM maintains all necessary environmental permits to operate within the Tintic operations area, including the current\nlarge mine permit update. As part of this update, environmental resources within the Tintic Test Mine were reviewed.\nAs of the date of the Tintic Technical Report, all water rights and other water sources have been secured and agreed\nupon. Furthermore, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has deemed that this area does not contain areas of critical\nwildlife concern.\nPermits and Environmental Liabilities\nTCM is working under the Notice of Intent Large Mine Operations (\"LMO\") plan permit approved by the UT DOGM\nin 2017. An updated LMO was submitted in February, 2022 and a revised version in November and is currently going\nthrough the review/approval process. TCM has exploration permits in place (i.e., surety bonding) to support surface\ndiamond drilling and the excavation of the Trixie Portal (Brandy Lee Decline). Once approved, the exploration for the\ndecline will fall within the updated LMO. Under agreement with the UT DOGM and the UT Department of Water\nQuality (DWQ), TCM is permitted to operate a pilot processing facility and a tails holding pad. TCM does not\ndischarge any water or effluents from current operations.\nAccessibility, Climate and Infrastructure\nThe closest major airport to the Tintic Project is in Salt Lake City, UT, located to the north-northwest of the city of\nProvo, UT via Interstate 15. Access to the Tintic Project from Provo, is via Interstate 15, a distance of 36 km south to\nexit 248 to US 6, then west on US 6, 27 km to Silver Pass Road, and then south 3.2 km to the Burgin project office\nsite. The Trixie test mine is located 2.6 km southwest of the Burgin office on the paved Silver Pass Access Road.\nProvo and other smaller towns, including Payson, Santaquin and Eureka are also adjacent to the Project.\nThe towns of Goshen, Santaquin, Payson and Provo are the main sources for supplies and services. Tintic Project\npersonnel and contractors also live in these areas.\nThe Tintic Project has sufficient power and water to support a mining operation.\nTopographic relief in the East Tintic District ranges from 1,494 m in the Goshen Valley east of the District to 1,996\nm at nearby Mineral Hill. The elevation at Trixie is at an elevation of 1,852 m.\nThe Tintic Mountains bear the scanty vegetation typical of an arid region. Different species of cactus, forbs and shrubs\ngrow on exposed rocky points. The more common trees of the higher slopes are pinyon pine, juniper and mountain\nmahogany. At lower elevations, maple thickets occur in the dry ravines, especially on the eastern slopes, while aspens\nare found in sheltered spots, more commonly those of northern exposure. In the valleys, sagebrush, rabbitbrush,\nBrigham's tea and cheat grass constitute almost the sole vegetation. Range improvement projects in the area have had\nsome effect on improving grazing.\nPage D-4\nThe climate of the East Tintic District is semi-arid. The U.S. Climate data website noted that the mean monthly low\ntemperatures at the nearby town of Elberta range from -10° Celsius (C) (15° Fahrenheit (F)) in January to 15°C (58°F)\nin July. The mean monthly high temperatures range from 2°C (37°F) in January to 33°C (93°F) in July. The Project\nhas year-round access and operating season.\nThe Tintic Project's main office, laboratory, workshops and onsite processing facilities are located at the Burgin site,\nimmediately off Highway 6 and northeast of the Trixie test mine. The Burgin mine is a past-producing underground\noperation that was last mined in 1976. All references to Burgin are with respect to the main office and surface facilities\nlocated at this site, not the Trixie test mine or deposit unless otherwise specified.\nA mill facility previously operational in 2002 is located at the Burgin site. In October, 2021, a pilot vat leaching circuit\nwas established within the old Burgin mill facility for the recovery of gold and silver from of the mineralized material\nfrom the Trixie test mine. ODV's recent operations also included trucking mineralized material to an offsite facility\nfor vat and heap leaching. This activity occurred from late 2020 up to May, 2022.\nIn 2022, a pilot tailings facility was constructed on site adjacent to the mill facility. The facility was double lined for\nfuture re-permitting/repurpose as a heap leach facility.\nThe onsite laboratory at the Burgin site provides fire assay analysis for gold and silver for all underground grade\ncontrol sampling from the Trixie test mine. AAS and bottle roll analysis to complement onsite VAT leaching and\nprocessing has also been established. Using an onsite laboratory to assay samples generated on site is common practice\nin the mining industry. Onsite laboratories usually participate in round robin exercises with government or independent\nlaboratories as part of their Quality Assurance and Quality Control programs. In addition, onsite laboratories, such as\nthe Burgin site usually send out check samples and engage laboratory auditing consultants to independently review\ntheir procedures.\nThe mineral property is sufficiently large that construction of further infrastructure at the Project will not be hindered\nby lack of space.\nHistory\nAll \"reserves\" and \"resources\" estimates provided in this section are historical in nature and should not be relied upon.\nThe QP has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.\nIt is unlikely they comply with current NI 43-101 requirements or follow CIM Definitional Standards, and their\nrelevance and reliability have not been verified. They are included in this section for illustrative purposes only and\nODV is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral reserves. For the purposes of this section, the term \"ore\"\nis being used in a historical context.\nTintic District – Early Mining History (1869 to 2002)\nEconomic mineralization in the Tintic District was first discovered in 1869 and, within a few years, most of the major\noutcropping ore bodies were being mined and many of the historic mining towns, including Diamond, Silver City,\nMammoth, Eureka, Dividend and Knightsville had been established. By 1899, the Tintic District had become one of\nthe richest mining districts in the United States. Active mining in the district continued through the 20th and the\nbeginning of the 21st century.\nEast Tintic District\nEven though many claims in what is now identified as the East Tintic District had been staked before the turn of the\n20th century, the only known occurrence of surface mineralization was in a small outcrop near the present Eureka\nLilly shaft. All future discoveries of the blind ore bodies in the East Tintic District have been based on surface\nalteration and underground geological interpretation.\nE.J. Raddatz became interested in the East Tintic District around 1906 and acquired a major holding in what is now\nthe Tintic Standard area. Raddatz reasoned that, even though the surface rocks were inhospitable, there was a chance\nPage D-5\nof discovery in the Ophir limestone at depth. It took a considerable amount of time, two shafts and thousands of feet\n(ft) of drift and winze workings but, in 1916, the Tintic Standard deposit was discovered and went on to become one\nof the major lead-silver mines in the world.\nMining geologists, attracted by the discovery of the Tintic Standard deposit, began to study the district. Based on these\nstudies, a long drive on the 700 level of the Tintic Standard mine was commissioned. This exploration work intersected\nthe mineral deposit that became the North Lily mine. Similar strategies led to the discovery of the Eureka Standard\nmine.\nDuring World War II, the United States recognized that, in the event of a long war, new sources of raw material would\nbe essential. As a result, the USGS undertook an exploration program seeking blind ore bodies in the East Tintic\nDistrict. One of the blind targets identified by the USGS was the CCMC oxide area, a prominent outcrop of oxidized\nand pyritized volcanics which overlies the Burgin deposit. However, no major discovery was made from either the\nsinking of the 22.6 m (75 ft) deep CCMC shaft or the drift from the Apex Standard mine. It was later surface drilling\nthat made the discovery of the Burgin ore body.\nDistrict production slowly increased through discovery of new mines and peaked between 1921 and 1930. From that\npeak, production decreased to a low between 1961 and 1970. Production from the Burgin mine led to a second peak\nof between 1971 and 1976.\nTrixie – Exploration Underground Development and Mining (1927 to 1995)\nTrixie Early Exploration (Pre-1957)\nFollowing the discovery of the Tintic Standard deposit in 1917, the North Lily deposit in 1927 and the Eureka Standard\ndeposit in 1928, interest was sparked over a poorly exposed structure overlying the current location of the Trixie test\nmine.\nIntense hydrothermal alteration of volcanic rocks exposed at surface at the Trixie site attracted the attention of the\nU.S. Bureau of Mines, which, in 1946-1947 conducted a number of studies in the Trixie area.\nBetween 1954-1955 the USGS conducted sampling and mapping of the area immediately north of the current Trixie\nshaft location. This was followed up by the drilling that confirmed the presence of the Trixie fault and the validity of\nthe surface anomalies when low-grade lead-zinc ore was intersected in the Trixie fault zone. After the conclusion of\nthe USGS research program in 1956, Bear Creek Mining completed additional holes in the target area and several of\nthese holes intersected strong lead-zinc replacement mineralization in the underlying limestone. Despite the apparent\npresence of ore-grade mineralization at depth, the disappointing core recoveries resulted in surface exploration work\nbeing terminated in 1957. Subsequently, the decision was made to conduct future exploration from underground.\nTrixie - Shaft Sinking and Underground Development and Mining (1968 to 1992)\nThe sinking of the Trixie shaft was initiated in 1968 and had reached the 750 ft level by 1969. Although the initial\ntarget of exploration at the Trixie historic mine was lead-zinc replacement mineralization in the hanging wall of the\nTrixie Fault, a gold-bearing structure was encountered during shaft sinking. This northerly-trending and steeply west-\ndipping structural zone became the primary source of ore, which was concentrated along three gold-silver mineralized\nshoots referred to as the 756 ore shoot, the 75-85 ore shoot, and the Survey zone.\nThe original carbonate replacement deposit (CRD) that was discovered at the Trixie historic mine in 1969 is located\non the north end of the deposit within the downthrown carbonate sequence north of the Trixie fault. While limited in\nscale, the replacement mineralization consists of massive sulphide minerals and jasperoid between the 750 ft level and\n900 ft level.\nThe 756 ore shoot represents the most productive of the three historically mined ore zones. This ore shoot plunges to\nthe north, towards the Trixie and Eureka Standard faults and was mined continuously from approximately 75 ft above\nthe 625 level to below the deepest 1350 level development. Based on limited historic drilling it remains open at depth.\nPage D-6\nIn 1976, as mining and exploration continued within the 756 ore shoot, the 75-85 ore shoot was discovered\napproximately 1,600 ft (488 m) south of the Trixie shaft. The 75-85 ore shoot was mined from approximately 50 ft\n(15 m) above the 625 level down to the 1200 level.\nIn early 1980, Bear Creek Mining discovered the Survey zone while exploring for the Sioux-Ajax fault by drifting\nsouth on the 1050 ft level of the Trixie historic mine. The Survey vein segment was explored and extensively\ndeveloped by Kennecott on the 750, 900, 1050 and 1200 levels during the pre-1995 silica flux mining periods. The\nsouthern end of the Survey Vein is extended for a distance of 3,400 ft south of the main shaft along the 1050 level and\nit remains open to the south and at depth.\nIn 1980, Sunshine Mining Corporation leased the Burgin unit from CCMC and by 1983 had also begun work at Trixie\nwhere it re-started mining operations and undertook additional underground development and diamond drilling. Much\nof the underground development and drilling from this time appears to have been focused on the 900, 1050, 1200 and\n1350 levels. Perhaps the most notable exploration efforts at Trixie during this time were the southerly extensions of\nthe 900, 1050 and 1200 ft level drifts, following the discovery of the Survey zone and the northeastward extension\nfrom the 1350 ft level to connect with the 1100 ft level of the Eureka Standard mine. This connection provided the\nunderground access needed to evaluate the Eureka Standard fault along-strike and down-dip from the original Eureka\nStandard mine workings. Sunshine operated the Trixie historic mine until terminating their lease with CCMC at the\nend of 1992.\nTrixie Exploration and Production (2000 to 2002)\nBetween 2000 and 2002, CCMC (through its affiliate Tintic Utah Metals LLC) undertook an aggressive surface and\nunderground drilling program at Trixie resulting in the discovery of a small-tonnage gold-silver resource associated\nwith the earlier mined 75-85 mineralized zone. The 625 ft level was developed within the mine in 2001, but mining\nwas suspended due to the decrease in the price of gold below $300/oz and CCMC's financial and reported management\nproblems.\nTrixie Exploration and Production (2019 to 2021)\nTCM – Trixie, Modern Target Generation (2019 to 2020)\nTCM acquired the historical Trixie mine at the beginning of 2019, and initially focused its assessment on the base-\nmetal resource opportunity at the Burgin mine. However, high-grade gold opportunities that had potential for near-\nterm production and revenue at Trixie quickly became the focus of the company. Since most of the historic mining\nwas focused on the steep west-dipping structural corridor with very little development or exploration into either the\nfootwall or hanging wall, there was high potential to define additional mineralized structures in close proximity to the\nexisting underground infrastructure.\nIn August, 2019, TCM made the decision to commence rehabilitation of the historic mine and shaft, with the intention\nof beginning underground drilling and exploration of documented targets on the historic 625 ft and 750 ft development\nlevels.\nBy December, 2019, TCM had compiled the historic Trixie datasets into a new 3D model of the deposit and identified\na significant new target in the immediate footwall to the 610 stope. This new target, initially termed the North Survey\nVein, was developed from reconsidering assays within historic surface RC holes which could not have originated from\nany of the historically mined areas. Further investigation of this target led to the discovery of the T2 and T4 structures.\nThe broad zones of mineralization encountered in the 2000-2001 surface RC drilling were originally interpreted to be\ncaused by the smearing of mineralization within the holes. However, 2021 exploration work by TCM demonstrated\nthat mineralization up to 60 ft in width is associated with the T4 stockwork. The broad zones of mineralization\nencountered in the 2000-2001 RC drilling were thus re-interpreted as intercepts of T2-T4 stockwork mineralization in\nthe immediate footwall of the 75-85 structure.\nPage D-7\nTCM T2 Discovery (2020 to 2021)\nBetween February and June, 2020, refurbishment of the 625 level was completed and this allowed for the\ncommencement of underground diamond drilling. A total of five diamond drill holes were completed between June\nand August, 2020.\nDespite extremely difficult drilling conditions, visible mineralization within the footwall of the 610 stope was\nconfirmed in three of the five holes. With the visual confirmation of the mineralization and structure, a decision was\nmade by TCM management to commence development of an exploration drift eastward towards the target zone.\nThe decision to develop into the target zone proved fortuitous as only 13 m (44 ft) east of the historic 625 ft level\ndevelopment, TCM drifted directly into the T2 structure.\nAbundant visible gold associated with the striking green colour of the mineralized zone aided the visual identification\nand test mining of the T2 structure. Initial test mining continued north and south on-strike of the steeply east dipping\nstructure to determine potential strike lengths of the mineralized zone. At the same time, the original 609 exploration\ncross-cut was extended further eastward to test ground immediately east of the T2 structure for further mineralization.\nTogether with additional diamond drilling and exploration cross-cuts a broad zone of mineralized stockwork veining\nup to 25 m (80 ft) in width was identified, and this is referred to as the T4 stockwork zone of mineralization.\nTCM Underground Development and Mineral Processing (2020 to 2021)\nIn November, 2020, the first shipment of mineralized material was shipped to an offsite processing facility and the\nfirst gold was poured by TCM. Continual underground development and drilling through 2021 helped define T2\nmineralization over a 120 m (400 ft) strike length and led to the recognition of the scale of the T4 stockwork\nmineralization. Design work for a surface portal and internal decline ramp to access the Trixie underground\ndevelopment was commenced shortly thereafter. A geological model for T2-T4 mineralization identified the potential\nsignificance of the overlying Ophir Shale as a cap above the Tintic Quartzite host rock in influencing the T2-T4\nmineralized zone. In the fall of 2021, the Burgin processing facility was equipped with an onsite vat leaching process.\nOn May 30, 2022, ODV announced the completion of its acquisition of TCM.\nGeological Setting and Mineralization\nGeological Setting\nThe Tintic Project is located within the historic Tintic mining district, a cluster of base and precious metal deposits\ncovering more than 200 square kilometres (km2) (or approximately 80 square miles) within the East Tintic Mountains\nof north-central UT. The district is centred approximately 90 km (56 miles) south-southwest of Salt Lake City and 65\nkm (40 miles) south of the Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposit. The East Tintic Mountains occupy a\nposition within the Late Cretaceous Sevier fold and thrust belt approximately 30 km (20 miles) from the eastern limit\nof the Basin and Range extensional province, as defined by the surface expression of the Wasatch fault. District\nmineralization is associated with a post-Sevier compression and pre-Basin and Range extension period of magmatism\nspanning ca. 27-35 Ma (latest Eocene to Oligocene). Commonly divided into Main, East, North and Southwest\nsubdistricts, the greater Tintic is collectively the second largest metal producing district in UT state, with Bingham\nfirst and Park City a close third. The core Tintic Project area covers more than 90% of known deposits within the East\nTintic subdistrict. Additional coverage extends north, west, and south into the North, Main and Southwest districts,\nrespectively.\nDistrict Geology\nThe geology of the Tintic district can be summarized as the record of four major phases of geologic evolution. These\nare 1) development of a Palaeozoic platformal sequence atop previously deformed Precambrian basement, 2) folding,\nfaulting and uplift accommodating east-west shortening during Late Cretaceous Sevier Orogeny, 3) latest Eocene to\nOligocene calc-alkaline magmatism associated with district mineralization, and 4) Miocene to recent Basin and Range\nextension.\nPage D-8\nAccommodation of east-west shortening during Late Cretaceous Sevier Orogeny resulted in the development of the\ndistrict scale Tintic syncline-East Tintic anticline fold pair, and several associated district-scale generally west-vergent\nthrusts. The geometry of the sub-horizontal roughly north-south trending fold pair is responsible for the general\nbasement architecture of the Tintic district, wherein the youngest (Mississippian) rocks of the Palaeozoic sequence\nare preserved along the trough of the Tintic syncline in the Main district and the Tintic Quartzite is present at its\nhighest structural levels along the crest of the East Tintic anticline in the East district. High-angle structures developed\nin relation to the Sevier orogeny include a system of predominantly northeast trending faults, with strike-slip offset\ninterpreted as accommodating differential displacement syn-compression, and a system of variably oriented normal\nfaults developed in accommodation of late to post-orogenic gravitational collapse.\nExtensive erosion following Sevier uplift resulted in the development of a rugged paleo-topography by the onset of\ndistrict magmatism ca. 35 Ma. The latest Eocene to Oligocene magmatic record consists of a quartz latite flow and\ntuff dominant sequence of irregular thickness up to 1,500 m (5,000 ft) with cross cutting to coeval locally porphyritic\nmonzonite to quartz monzonite intrusions of varying geometries. District mineralization, dated in the East Tintic at\naround 31 Ma, is contemporaneous and associated. In the East Tintic district, known fissure-vein and replacement\ndeposits are nearly exclusively buried beneath the irregular volcanic cover. While the basal (pre-mineral) volcanic\ncover hosts no significant mineralization, it is commonly characterized by significant hydrothermal alteration. Several\nsub-km-scale lithocaps point to potential porphyry targets at depth, where more localized alteration along\npredominantly north to northeast-trending fissures with associated pebble dikes were used in successful targeting of\nmany of the known historic deposits.\nThe Palaeozoic sequence and its irregular volcanic cover are disrupted by Basin and Range extensional faulting.\nMiocene-age volcanics likely mark the onset of extension in the district ca. 16-18 Ma. While any pre-existing fault\nstructures are likely primed for some degree of Basin and Range extensional reactivation, the most significant normal\noffsets occur along roughly north-south trending structures, e.g., the district-scale Eureka Lilly fault. The variably\nnorth-south striking and west-dipping Eureka Lilly fault forms a major aquitard through the East Tintic district,\ndividing a fresh, cool-water-table in its hanging-wall to the west from a hot and saline water table in its footwall to\nthe east. Post-lava offset on the Eureka Lilly fault is apparently variable along strike and may account for only one-\nhalf (1/2) to one-third (1/3) of the total offset across the structure, believed to have initiated during Late Sevier\norogeny.\nDistrict Mineralization and Structure\nThe four subdistricts of the Tintic are in part distinguishable in terms of their known mineral occurrences, hosted\nwithin the deformed Palaeozoic sequence and, to a more limited extent, Oligocene monzonitic intrusions. The Main\ndistrict is the most historically productive district by far, with characteristic carbonate-hosted lead-zinc-silver\nreplacement deposits that form predominantly north to northeast-trending sub-horizontal zones rooted into subvertical\nchimney-like mineralized bodies rich in copper, gold and silver. Carbonate-replacement deposits with economic zinc\n± lead ± silver are likewise present in the East district and the historically least-productive North district. The East\ndistrict is unique in terms of the relative structural complexity of its deposits, and by the added presence of gold and\nsilver-rich high-sulphidation fissure vein systems hosted within the brittle and unreactive Tintic Quartzite, such as at\nTrixie. The Southwest district is characterised by a relative dominance of igneous rocks, containing fissure systems\nhosted within the Silver City stock and smaller associated monzonitic porphyry intrusions. The Southwest district is\nalso host to the Southwest Tintic porphyry copper system, viewed as subeconomic, but with minor historical\nproduction from peripheral high-sulphidation, copper-silver-lead veins. Several key observations suggest the presence\nof additional and potentially economic porphyry centres within the district. This includes indicator clay assemblages\nand elevated molybdenum and/or copper-lead ratios at the Big Hill, Silver Pass, and Government Canyon lithocaps,\nall contained within the Tintic Project claims area.\nGeology, Structure and Mineralization at Trixie\nMineralization at the Trixie test mine is structurally controlled within a north-south-trending fissure-vein and breccia\nsystem developed within the brittle Tintic Quartzite. Gold and silver-rich mineralization within the so-called Trixie\nvein system is best classified as high-sulfidation epithermal (see discussion in Section 8). Current development at\nTrixie is focused within the footwall to the historically productive steep-to-the-west-dipping 75-85 structure, targeting\nPage D-9\nthe subvertical-to-the-east-dipping T2 fissure vein, its hanging -wall T4 breccia zone, and a network of smaller-scale\nlikewise north-south-trending mineralized fissures contained within it.\nSub-horizontal Palaeozoic strata exposed in underground at Trixie are believed to occupy a position within or proximal\nto the hinge zone of the East Tintic anticline, the nature of which may exert primary influence on the geometry,\nfrequency, and distribution of grade controlling structures within the Trixie vein system. The stratigraphic contact\nbetween the Tintic Quartzite and overlying and impermeable lower shale member of the Ophir Formation appears to\nhave a major controlling influence on the development and distribution grade and mineralization at Trixie. While\ncontrolling structures within the Trixie vein system do penetrate the younger overlying sequences, mineralization\ntypically displays strong rheologic control and is restricted to the older and underlying brittlely fractured Tintic\nQuartzite host.\nThe main shaft of the historic Trixie mine was collared at approximately 1,852 m (6,075 ft) elevation into an\noutcropping window of Middle Cambrian Teutonic Limestone. The shaft passes through the full thickness of the Ophir\nFormation to reach the Tintic Quartzite at a depth of approximately 125 m (410 ft). All current development stems off\nthe historic 625-foot mine level, deeper historic workings include 750, 900, 1050, 1200 and 1350-foot levels. The full\nextent of both modern and historic development at Trixie resides within the hanging-wall to the district-scale Eureka\nLilly fault. The fresh groundwater table of the Eureka Lilly hanging-wall at Trixie sits below the ca. 1,437 m (4,716\nft) elevation of the 1350-foot level, around 425 m below surface. The Late Eocene to Oligocene Packard Quartz Latite\nunconformably overlies the Palaeozoic Tintic-Ophir-Teutonic sequence in nearly every direction surrounding the\nTrixie main shaft. The Packard Quartz Latite is in local unconformable contact with both the Ophir Formation and\nTintic Quartzite, reaching thicknesses up to 380 m (1,250 ft) directly south of the ventilation shaft.\nThe core of the Trixie vein system occupies a high-seated position within an east-west oriented horst, the bounding\nstructures of which may have served as critical pathways for mineralizing fluids. North of the Trixie main shaft, the\nTintic Quartzite is down-dropped an estimated 198 m (650 ft) across the east-west-trending sub-vertically north-\ndipping Trixie fault zone. At the very northern limits of development, the sequence is again offset relatively down to\nthe north across the Eureka Standard fault zone, which appears to consist locally of at least two major east-northeast\ntrending splays. Though not fully constrained, relative stratigraphic offset across the Eureka Standard fault zone is of\nsimilar or greater magnitude to that observed across the Trixie Fault zone. Approaching the southern end of\ndevelopment, the Tintic Quartzite and mineralized structures of the Trixie vein system appear to be offset across the\npresumably steep to the south-dipping Sioux-Ajax fault zone. The Sioux-Ajax fault zone has not been intersected by\nany modern-day development. Constraining its displacement and orientation is complicated by several intersecting\nwest-dipping splays of the Eureka Lilly fault that appear to further offset the mineralization.\nThe Sioux-Ajax fault system is well-known within the Main District as a major ore controlling structure, with\nassociated breccias hosting large replacement bodies in both the Mammoth and Iron Blossom mines. The Sioux-Ajax\nfault system of the Main district consists locally of two or more splays, generally striking east-southeast and dipping\nsteeply to the north. The fault system is buried beneath volcanic cover projecting along strike into the East Tintic\ndistrict, wherein its correlation and relationships with known structures have long been a topic of high interest and\ndebate. Recent interpretations based on the integration of historical mapping with high-resolution magnetic data\nacquired in 2019 suggest that the Trixie, Eureka Standard, and south-dipping Sioux Ajax fault zones, as defined within\nthe Trixie development area, are structurally linked with the Sioux Ajax zone of the Main district and may have\ncollectively provided the deep-seated plumbing necessary for mineralization at Trixie.\nThe historic 756 ore shoot at the north end of Trixie development displays a steep northerly plunge in the footwall to\nthe Trixie fault zone. At the southern end of Trixie development, higher grade ore shoots within the historically mined\n75-85 zone exhibit a steep southerly plunge for which the presumed south-dipping Sioux Ajax fault zone is the\ninterpreted structural control. These historical observations suggest that mineralization and grade within the T2 fissure\nvein and T4 zone currently in development in the immediate footwall to the 75-85 structure may be characterized by\na similar geometry.\nPage D-10\nExploration Programs\nUnderground Exploration\nExploration work undertaken at the Tintic Project in 2022 consisted of coordinated underground mapping and\nsampling programs covering both new exploration drifts and development along and across the mineralization\nunderground at Trixie. Post-advancement face, rib and back chip-sampling, and post-survey three-dimensional\nunderground back and rib geologic mapping were conducted by the geological team.\nFrom January through December 12, 2022, a total of 2,115 samples from 547 individual chip sample sequences were\ncollected across a number of different test mining and exploration development areas underground at Trixie.\nNo surface regional-scale mapping or sampling programs were conducted in 2022.\nMicon's QP discussed the Trixie sampling practices and procedures with Project personnel as well as observing the\nunderground face chip sampling during a site visit conducted in September 2022. Micon's QP believes that the Trixie\nsampling practices and procedures are managed according to the Exploration Best Practice Guidelines established by\nthe CIM. Micon's QP also believes that the samples derived from the underground chip sampling practices are\nappropriately taken, recorded and located to be able to be used as part of the underlying data for a mineral resource\nestimate.\nExploration Drilling Programs\nSurface RC Drilling\nSurface RC drilling of the Trixie Deposit (T1, T2, T3, T4, and 75-85 mineralized zones) commenced in July, 2022\nand a total of 6,937.25 m (22,760 ft) of RC drilling in 21 drill holes were completed by early December, 2022 when\nthe program terminated.\nAssay results from 8 RC drillholes from the 2022 RC surface drilling program have been received and incorporated\ninto the Tintic Technical Report. A total of four of the surface RC drill holes had no significant assays and one-hole,\nTRC053, was abandoned.

Although recovery in the diamond drilling program averages a reasonable 90.1%, the core\nsuffers significant destruction during the drilling process resulting in difficult interpretations of significant mineralized\nstructures, and increased uncertainty in the rock quality designation and recovery data. Broken ground, significant\nfaulting, and hard abrasive lithologies have resulted in slow sample production and further compromised the structural\ninterpretation. Average RC production of 27.4 m (90 ft) per day and diamond drill production of 9.4 m (31 ft) per day\nwere typical of the 2022 program. In addition, the lack of structural data made true-width relationships difficult to\ndetermine from the drilling.\nDue to the issues with the drilling, the historical and current underground development have been the primary sources\nof information regarding the nature, orientation and extent of the mineralization at Trixie for the initial mineral\nresource estimate.\nPage D-12\nSlow turn-around times of 60 to 90 days at the assay laboratories have resulted in a significant lack of assay data and\nhave prevented the inclusion of many diamond drill and RC holes in the initial mineral resource estimate.\nConclusions\nMicon's QP reviewed the drilling and sampling procedures at Trixie during a site visit and in further discussions with\nODV personnel. Micon's QP believes that despite the challenges encountered during the Trixie drilling programs, the\ndrilling and sampling procedures have been and are being conducted with industry best practices in mind, such as\nthose outlined by CIM. Therefore, the drilling can be appropriately included as part of the database which serves as\nthe basis for the current and future mineral resource estimates.\nSampling, Analysis and Data Verification\nThe following section describes the preparation, analysis and security procedures used for all underground face chip\nand drill core samples collected during 2022 at the Trixie test mine which are used in the current resource estimate.\nSamples collected prior to 2022 and which are included in the current resource estimate were validated by Dr. Thomas\nA. Henricksen QP, C.P.G. and are considered to meet generally accepted industry standards for sample preparation,\nanalysis, QA/QC and security protocols. The QP has reviewed the material related to the samples validated by Dr.\nHenricksen and believes that they meet generally accepted industry standards, as outlined by CIM, and are therefore\nsuitable to be used as the basis for a mineral resource estimate.\nSample Handling and Security\nSample handling and security procedures are managed by TCM personnel. These procedures are described in detail\nbelow.\nUnderground Chip Sampling\nAll underground chip samples are collected by TCM mine geologists from each of the active faces during each shift,\nas required. Chip samples are collected and do not exceed 0.91 m (3 ft) in length. The face is washed for safety, and\nfor better identification of mineralization, alteration and structures. The hangingwall and footwall of the structures are\nmarked on the face and back. Sample intervals are marked up and follow lithological contacts. Samples are transported\nby the geologist from the Trixie test mine to the onsite Tintic laboratory at the Burgin administrative complex.\nDrill Core Sampling\nFollowing extraction from the core tube, underground diamond drill core is placed in wax-impregnated core boxes\nwith depths marked by wooden marking blocks. The boxes are labelled with the drill hole number, the box number,\nand the depth interval, then lidded and taped shut. Boxes are brought to surface daily by miners and picked up by\nTCM logging geologists and geotechnicians and delivered to the TCM logging facility.\nAt the core logging facility, drill core is marked with footage depths then recovery and rock quality are measured and\nrecorded. Geologic and geotechnical information is logged and input into Datamine's DHLogger software and\nsynchronized to a central database. Sample intervals are marked with aluminum tags and unique sample identification\nnumbers, and input into DHLogger, as well. Drill core is then photographed and sent to the core cutting facility.\nTCM core cutters half-cut the drill core using an Almonte Automated Core Saw. Half the core is placed back in the\ncore box and the other half is placed in a calico or plastic sample bag, labelled with the corresponding sample\nidentification number. Boxes of half-cut core are palleted and moved to core storage. Sample bags are moved to a\nstaging area for dispatch to an analytical laboratory.\nDuring staging for dispatch, standard and blank samples are inserted into the sample sequence for QA/QC. Bagged\nsamples are then placed in rice bags in groups of five to 10 samples, depending on weight. Rice bags are labelled with\na unique shipment ID and sequential numbering (eg: Bag 1, Bag 2) A sample list and sample submittal form are\ninserted into the first bag for each shipment, then bags are sealed with metal ties, loaded on pallets, and secured using\nPage D-13\nclear shrink wrap. All samples are shipped to ALS Analytical Laboratories via Old Dominion Shipping. Copies of a\nmanifest and chain of custody form are given to TCM and Old Dominion.\nReverse Circulation Drill Chip Sampling\nDuring the RC drilling process, rock chips are lifted to surface with air and water pressure. Chips are run through a\ncyclone attachment on the drill tower, fitted with splitters which cause a 1:2 split of the chips. At five-foot intervals,\none-third (1/3) of the chips is separated into cloth filter bags for sampling, while two-thirds (2/3) are separated in\npolyethylene bags for storage as reject material. Once per five-foot interval, a coarse mesh sieve is inserted into the\nreject outflow from the cyclone to collect a small, representative chip sample. This sample is placed in chip sample\ntrays for logging. Once per fifty-foot interval, an additional splitter is added to the cyclone to divide the sampled chips\ninto a sample and a duplicate for QA/QC purposes. Any water overflow from the cyclone outflow is caught with a -\n80-mesh sieve to prevent the loss of fine material. Bags are sealed and laid out to dry on the drill pad.\nSample bags and chip trays are collected from the drill pad by TCM logging geologists and geotechnicians and\ndelivered to the TCM logging facility. Geologic information is logged into Datamine's DHLogger software and\nsynchronized to a central database. Chip trays are then photographed.\nDuring staging for dispatch, standard and blank samples are inserted into the sample sequence for QA/QC. Samples\nare then placed in rice bags in groups of five to 10 samples depending on weight. Rice bags are labelled with a unique\nshipment ID and sequential numbering (e.g., Bag 1, Bag 2). A sample list and sample submittal form are inserted into\nthe first bag for each shipment, then bags are sealed with metal ties, loaded on pallets, and secured using clear shrink\nwrap. All samples are shipped to ALS Analytical Laboratories via Old Dominion Shipping. Copies of a manifest and\nchain of custody form are given to TCM and Old Dominion.\nSample Preparation and Assaying\nALS Sample Preparation\nThe following outlines ALS laboratories sample preparation procedures:\n• Samples are sorted and logged into the ALS LIMS program.\n• Samples are dried and weighed.\n• Samples are crushed to +70% passing 2 mm (CRU-31).\n• The crushed sample split of up to 500 g is pulverized to +85% passing 75 μm screen (PUL 32m).\n• Once analysis is complete, pulp material is returned to TCM for storage and coarse rejects are\ndisposed of after 90 days.\nALS Gold Assaying\nThe following outlines ALS laboratories assay procedures used on the Trixie mineralization:\n• A 50-g pulp aliquot is analyzed by Au-AA26: fire assay followed by aqua regia digestion (HNO3‐\nHCl) with an AAS.\n• When assay results are higher than 100 g/t Au, a second 50-g pulp aliquot is analysed by Au-GRA22:\nfire assay, parting with nitric acid (HNO3) with a gravimetric finish.\n• Selected samples were analyzed by metallic screen. The +100 μm fraction (Au+) is analyzed in its\nentirety by FA with gravimetric finish. The 100 μm fraction (minus) is homogenized and two\nsubsamples are analyzed by FA with AAS (Au-AA25) or gravimetric finish (Au-GRA21). The\nPage D-14\naverage of the two minus fraction subsamples are taken and reported as the Au- fraction result. The\ngold content is then determined by the weighted average of the Au+ and Au- fractions.\nALS Multi-Element Assaying\nThe following outlines ALS Laboratories assay procedures used for multi-element assaying:\n• Some samples are analyzed by trace-level multi-element method ME‐MS61: a 0.25-g aliquot is\ndigested by four-acid digestion (HNO3‐HClO4‐HF‐HCl) and HCl leach (method GEO-4A01) and\nanalyzed by ICP-AES.\n• Following this analysis, the results are reviewed for high concentrations of bismuth, mercury,\nmolybdenum, silver and tungsten and diluted accordingly. Samples meeting these criteria are then\nanalyzed by ICP-MS. Results are corrected for spectral interelement interferences.\nTintic Laboratory Preparation\nThe Tintic laboratory sample preparation procedures are outlined as follows:\n• The samples are loaded into a drying oven to remove any moisture\n• After drying the sample order is confirmed on the submittal form. Any discrepancies are brought to\nthe geology group's attention and resolved.\n• Each sample is prepared using a belt elevator feeding into a jaw crusher, then directly into a gyratory\ncrusher reducing sample particle size to approximately 3.5 mm.\n• The sample is then introduced to a rotary splitter to reduce volume and maintain representation of\nthe entire sample. The rotary table has 12 paired pans of which will be selected randomly until an\napproximate 2,000-gram split is available for pulverizing.\n• Pulverizing is achieved by feeding the selected sample split into a vibratory feeder that feeds a disc\npulverizer.\n• The finely ground sample is then introduced to a small jones splitter and further reduced to\napproximately 250-grams and inserted into a sample packet ready for assaying.\nTintic Laboratory Gold and Silver Assaying\nThe following outlines Tintic Laboratory assay procedures:\n• Each prepared sample packet is forwarded to the fire assay laboratory where a routine one assay ton\nassay is performed. This assay uses lead as a collector for any precious metals in the fusion step and\nthen oxidizes the lead using a cupel (magnesia cup) to separate the precious metals from the lead.\n• The remaining \"bead\" of precious metals is referred to as a Dore bead. The Assayer will tap each\nDore with a hammer to remove any residual cupel and then place the bead in a ceramic cup.\n• The dore beads are then forwarded to the Balance room where each Dore is weighed using a micro-\nbalance and recording the weight.\n• A 25% from concentrate volume of nitric acid is added to each ceramic cup containing a dore bead\nand placed on a hotplate. The nitric acid dissolves silver leaving only the gold as a solid.\nPage D-15\n• The solution is decanted from the cup, the cup and gold are rinsed with deionized water, and then\nreturned to the hotplate to dry. The dry cup and gold are annealed and after cooling the gold is\nweighed on the micro-balance and weight recorded.\nQuality Assurance and Quality Control\nA total of 2,030 drill core and RC chip samples (including QA/QC samples) were assayed in 2022 at ALS. The 2022\nQA/QC program included a routine insertion of standards and blanks. TCM included one standard in every 20 samples\nand one blank in every 30 samples.\nA total of 2,851 chip samples (including QA/QC samples) were assayed in 2022 at the Tintic laboratory. The 2022\nQA/QC program included a routine insertion of standards and blanks. TCM included one standard in every 10 samples\nand one blank in every 20 samples.\nAccuracy is monitored by adding standards at the rate of one Certified Reference Material (CRM) or Standard for\nevery 20 samples. Standards are used to detect assay problems with specific sample batches and any possible long-\nterm biases in the overall dataset. TCM's definition of a quality control failure is when:\n• Assays for a CRM are outside ±three standard deviations (±3SD) or ±10%.\n• Assays for two consecutive CRMs are outside ±2SD, if one of them is outside ±3SD.\nConclusions\nMicon's QP has reviewed and had extensive discussions with the Corporation's personnel regarding QA/QC program\nat the Tintic Project and has reviewed the results of the Tintic laboratory audit by Qualitica Consulting. Micon's QP\nalso toured the Tintic laboratory during the September, 2022 site visit. During the discussions all aspects of the QA/QC\nprogram, results and recommendations of the Tintic laboratory audit as well as potential additions to the QA/QC\nprograms were discussed.\nBased on the QA/QC results from ALS, and the favourable audit of the Tintic laboratory, it is the opinion of Micon's\nQP that the assay database for the Trixie deposit is of suitable quality to be used in the estimate of resources and as\nthe basis for further work.\nData Verification\nIn order to undertake the review and validation of the initial mineral resource estimate for the Trixie deposit within\nthe Tintic Project, the QPs of the Tintic Technical Report undertook a number of discussions and meetings with ODV's\npersonnel and contractors to discuss details relevant to the exploration programs, QA/QC programs, parameters used\nfor the mineral resource estimate and the mineral resource estimate itself. The discussions were held via email chains\nand phone calls, and Microsoft Teams and Zoom meetings, as well as during the site visit. At all times the discussions\nwere open, frank and at no time was information withheld or not available to the QPs. Open and frank discussions\ncontinued throughout mineral resource validation in December, 2022 and January, 2023 on all aspects of the process,\nand this culminated in the completion of the initial mineral resource estimate.\nThe geologic modelling for the Trixie deposit was completed by ODV senior production geologist Courtney Kurtz,\nP.G. using Leapfrog Geo software. The MRE was completed by ODV chief resource geologist, Daniel Downton,\nP.Geo., using Datamine Studio RM Pro 1.12 software. The MRE was then reviewed and validated by William Lewis,\nP.Geo. and Alan San Martin, AusIMM(CP) of Micon.\nA site visit was conducted from September 12 to September 16, 2022 by Mr. Lewis to independently verify the\ngeology, mineralogy, drilling programs and the QA/QC programs at the Tintic Project.\nThe presence of grade variability is not a hindrance to producing a reliable resource estimate for a mineral deposit.\nThe first step is to recognize the variability and then to apply appropriate procedures and methodologies to minimize\nPage D-16\nany over estimation of the resource grade. Micon's QP believes that despite the demonstrated grade variability within\nthe Trixie deposit, ODV has used appropriate procedures within its estimation methodology to limit over estimation\nof the grade and, consequently skewing the metal content within the deposit.\nWhile the reproducibility of a number of samples clearly indicates the variability of the grade within the mineral zones\nthat comprise the Trixie deposit, Micon's QPs believe that the database generated for the Trixie deposit is adequate\nfor use as the basis of a mineral resource estimate. The database is also sufficiently reliable to be used as the basis for\nfurther work and upon which to conduct further economic studies.\nMetallurgical Testwork\nSample Provenance\nTwo bulk metallurgical composite samples were prepared by ODV from mineralization obtained during the\nexploration test mining performed during 2021 and early 2022.\nThe first bulk composite (T2 Soil Sample) was prepared from laboratory high grade coarse reject samples over an 8-\nmonth period from April to December 2021. This 477.5 kg sample was selected to be representative of a T2/T4 high\ngrade run of mine material leached in the TCM pilot vat leach facility (VLF) during 2021 and 2022.\nThe second composite sample (T4 Soil Sample) was prepared using four sample increments at various mine accessible\npoints of the T4 structure. This 171 kg sample selected to be representative of the bulk T4 structure at the 625 level.\nMetallurgical Testwork\nThe metallurgical testing was undertaken by Kappes, Cassiday & Associates, Reno, Nevada and included the\nfollowing primary testwork:\n• Multi-element analysis of the samples.\n• Diagnostic leaching.\n• Gold deportment mineralogy (AMTEL).\n• Bulk mineralogy (FLSmidth).\n• Bottle roll leach testing at various particle sizes.\n• Gravity separations tests.\n• Comminution testwork (Hazen Research).\nSample Characterization\nThe head grades of the two samples were 64.1 g/t Au and 102 g/t Ag for T2, and 8.8 g/t Au and 14.5 g/t Ag T4.\nBoth samples are characterized by high silica content (92% to 96%) and low sulphide sulphur content, typically less\nthan 0.2% S2-. Copper in the T2 sample measured about 750 g/t, but only about half of this was readily cyanide\nsoluble.\nDiagnostic leach tests using samples of the two composites ground to 80% passing 74 microns indicated that\napproximately 99% of the gold in sample T2 and 88% in sample T4, is directly soluble. Mineralogical gold deportment\nstudies showed that 99% of the gold in sample T2 was exposed and potentially cyanide soluble while T4 material\nshowed that 81% of the gold was free gold with hessite and telluride associations of 7% and 10% respectively. The\ngold grains identified in sample T2 tended to be larger than those in T4.\nPage D-17\nComminution tests showed that both samples were relatively hard and abrasive. Bond ball mill work indices of 18.2\nkWh/t and 19.0 kWh/t were calculated for T2 and T4, respectively.\nDeleterious elements often encountered in gold mineral resources are present in low concentrations in both these\nsamples. Mercury is <3 ppm, selenium was analyzed at or below 5 ppm, and arsenic was 176 g/t on average for T2\nand 29 g/t for the T4 sample. The T2 high grade structure sample did show relatively higher concentrations of these\ndeleterious elements than the T4 material. The sulphide sulphur content was relatively low for both samples and\ntherefore, it is unlikely that the mineralization will be acid generating.\nTestwork Results\nBottle roll cyanide leach tests gave results of up to 99% Au and 88% Ag extraction after 72 hours for sample T2. The\ncorresponding best T4 tests achieved 98% Au and 84% Ag extraction.\nGravity separation tests using sample T2 suggested that approximately about 40% gold can be recovered by gravity\nseparation.\nInitial Trixie Mineral Resource Estimate\nIntroduction\nThe initial Mineral Resource Estimate for the Trixie Test Mine (the \"Initial MRE\"), was conducted in December,\n2022 and January, 2023 and encompasses initial resources for the Trixie deposit.\nReaders are cautioned that the Corporation had announced the 2024 Trixie MRE on March 15, 2024, which\nrepresents an updated MRE to the Initial MRE. The Corporation intends to file a technical report in respect\nof the 2024 Trixie MRE within 45 days from March 15, 2024. See \"Mineral Resource Estimate Update since the\nTintic Technical Report\" above. For more details on the 2024 Trixie MRE, please refer to the news release of\nthe Corporation dated March 15, 2024, a copy of which is available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under the\nCorporation's issuer profile.\nMethodology\nThe mineral resource area for the Trixie deposit covers a strike length of approximately 445 m down to a vertical\ndepth of approximately 295 m below surface.\nThe wireframe models for the Trixie deposit were prepared using LeapFrog GEO v.2022.1. Wireframe modelling\nincluded the construction of five mineralized domains constrained to the extents of the regional-scale Tintic Quartzite\nlithologic unit and capped by shale belonging to the overlying lower member of the Ophir Formation. Geostatistical\nanalyses were carried out using Datamine Snowden Supervisor v.8.15.0.1. The estimation, block model and grade\ninterpolation, was prepared using Datamine StudioTM RM Pro v.1.12.113.0. Resource-level potentially mineable\nunderground shapes were created using the Deswik CAD v.2021.2.748 Shape Optimizer module.\nResource Database\nThe close-out date for the Trixie deposit Initial MRE database is December 12, 2022. It consists of 42 validated\ndiamond drill holes, totalling 2,358.45 m of core and comprised of 1,802 sample intervals. The database also includes\neight-validated RC drill holes, totalling 2,421.64 m of RC drilling and comprises 987 sample intervals, and 1,019\nunderground chip sample strings comprised of 4,467 sample intervals assayed for Au and silver Ag.\nThe database includes validated location, survey, and assay results. It also includes lithological descriptions taken\nfrom drill core logs.\nThe database covers the strike length of each mineralized domain at variable drill hole and chip sample spacings,\nranging between 1.5 to 50 m.\nPage D-18\nIn addition to the tables of raw data, each database includes several tables of calculated drill hole composites and\nwireframe solid intersections, which are required for the statistical evaluation and mineral resource block modelling.\nGeological Model\nThe geological model of the Trixie deposit was prepared in LeapFrog GEO v.2022.1, using underground mapping,\nchip samples, RC drill holes, and validated diamond drill holes, all completed by December 12, 2022.\nA total of five mineralized domains, were modelled with each domain restricted up dip by its contact with the lower\nshale member of the Ophir Formation, as this contact acts as an impermeable cap to mineralizing fluids.\nThe domains modelled were the T1, T2, T3, T4 and the 75-85. In addition, a north-south trending sub-vertically\ndipping fault structure has been mapped across multiple underground development headings near the 625 level and\nhas been intercepted in multiple drill holes. Though the full extent of the structure is at present unknown, it is currently\ninferred to project through the entirety of the model. As underground mapping indicates a minor offset of the T2\nstructure across this fault, it is used as a hard boundary for geological modelling and grade interpolation. The model\nis thus split into east and west fault blocks, with each mineralized domain subdivided into respective east and west\nsubdomains.\nGeostatistical Analysis\nCompositing\nMost of the analytical samples were collected with lengths between 0.31 and 1.52 m. A modal composite length of\napproximately 0.61 m was applied to domains T2 and T3, generating composites as close to 0.61 m as possible, while\ncreating residual intervals with a minimum length of 0.06 m. A modal composite length of 0.91 m was applied to all\nother domains. In all cases, composite files were derived from raw values within the modelled resource domains.\nHigh grade Capping\nMultiple capping (different capping at different ranges in each domain) was selected as the capping methodology for\nhigh grade outlier gold and silver assays at the Trixie deposit. After considering reconciliation results and geological\ncontinuity, the T2 domain uses a single capping level for gold. The top capping thresholds were selected based on the\nprobability plots and vary from 20.0 g/t to 1,350.0 g/t Au and 200.0 g/t to 2,500.0 g/t Ag.\nThe maximum range for high-grade continuity was established using the indicator variograms, which suggests a loss\nof continuity after 4.5 m to 9.0 m, depending on the mineralized domain. A range of 7.6 m was selected and applied\nto all zones as a general average search range for the first pass grade top cut interpolation.\nDensity\nThe density databases contain 512 measurements taken on samples across multiple geologic domains.\nAverage bulk density values in the mineralized domains were assigned to the T1 (2.616 t/m3), T2 (2.955 t/m3), T3\n(2.638 t/m3), T4 (2.621 t/m3), and 75-85 (2.617 t/m3) domains.\nA density of 0.00 t/m3 was assigned to the underground development from all past mining activities.\nBulk densities were used to calculate tonnages from the volume estimates in the block model.\nVariogram Analysis\nThe spatial distribution of gold and silver was evaluated through variogram analysis and spherical variograms were\nmodelled for each of the mineralized domains.\nPage D-19\nAll variogram analyses and modelling were performed in Datamine Snowden Supervisor v.8.15.0.1. Primary\ndirections and orientations of the variograms were observed in the data and visually in 3D space. These orientations\nwere then examined statistically within the software package to ensure they represented the best possible fit of the\ngeology and grade continuity.\nSearch Parameters\nFor the T2, T3 and 75-85 domains, the 3D directional-specific search ellipses were guided by the local structural\norientation of the domain for an anisotropic search. For the T1 and T4 domains 3D directional-specific search ellipses\nwere guided by the Au and Ag grade variograms. The search radii were influenced and determined by both the grade\nand indicator variograms.\nGrade distributions and kriging neighbourhood analyses were used to help guide the number of composites to use for\nthe grade interpolations.\nSearch neighbourhoods used different capping levels as determined through the threshold analyses.\nBlock Model and Grade Interpretation\nThe criteria used in the selection of block size include drill hole spacing, composite length, the geometry of the\nmodelled zone, and the anticipated mining methods. A block size of 1.22 m x 1.22 m x 1.83 m was used. Sub-cells\nwere used, allowing a resolution of 0.30 m x 0.30 m x 0.30 m to better reflect the shape of the mineralization domains.\nSub-cells were assigned the same values as their parent cell. No rotation was applied to the block model.\nFour search passes were used for the grade interpolation and each one utilized a capped grade from the multiple\ncapping levels determined through threshold analyses. A series of sensitivity runs were performed to examine the\nimpact of various parameters on the estimation. Parameters were selected, and gold and silver were estimated using\ninverse distance squared. Each subsequent estimation pass used increasing search neighbourhood sizes, determined\nfrom grade and indicator variogram results. Samples from a minimum of two drill holes or chip strings were required\nto estimate all blocks.\nModel Validation\nMineralized domain models were validated using a variety of methods including visual inspection of the model grades,\ngrade distributions compared to the informing raw samples, statistical comparisons of informing composites to the\nmodel for local and global bias, and reconciliation comparing the model to observed grades from underground\ndevelopment.\nAll analyses indicate that the model follows the grade distribution of the informing composites and that the accuracy\nof the model has been demonstrated. The total global comparison for each resource classification is within a 20%\ntolerance for bias and reconciliation. The Micon QPs consider that the model is valid and is a reasonable representation\nof the Trixie mineralization, based on the current level of sampling and geological information.\nMineral Resource Classification\nMineral Resource Classification was determined through geometric criteria deemed reasonable for the deposit.\nDue to the lack of sample data that fully crosscut the T1 and 75-85 domains, no material has been classified as\nmeasured for these domains, and the characteristics used to classify indicated material have tighter constraints.\nDue to the geological nature of the stockwork structures in the T4 domain, there is a degree of uncertainty in the ranges\nof the high-grade mineralization. Therefore, no material has been classified as measured in that domain.\nBlocks estimated within the mineralized domains not meeting the criteria to classify them as either measured, indicated\nor inferred were not classified and are not part of the mineral resource estimate.\nPage D-20\nReasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction\nA reasonable economic cut-off grade for resource evaluation at the Trixie deposit was determined using the parameters\npresented in Table 14. The QPs consider the selected cut-off grade of 4.85 g/t Au to be appropriate based on the current\nknowledge of the Project.\nTable 14: Resource Cut-Off Grade Parameters\nParameters Values (USD)\nMining Cost ($/ST) $60.00\nG&A ($/ST) $64.97\nHaulage ($/ST) $10.00\nMilling ($/ST) $89.00\nTotal Refining Cost ($/oz) $2.65\nGold Price ($/oz) $1,750.00\nRoyalty (Combination) 4.50%\nMill Recovery 95.0%\nCOG - Round up to (0.05 g/T) 4.85\nThe Deswik Stope Optimizer was used to demonstrate spatial continuity of the mineralized zones within \"potentially\nmineable shapes.\" The Deswik Stope Optimizer parameters used a minimum mining shape of 6.1 m along the strike\nof the deposit, a height of 6.1 m and a minimum width of 1.5 m. The maximum shape measures 6.1 m x 6.1 m x 12.2\nm in width. Only those blocks of the model constrained by the resulting conceptual mineable shapes are reported as\nresources.\nIn the opinion of the QPs, the use of the conceptual mining shapes as constraints to report Mineral Resource Estimates\ndemonstrate that the reported resources meet the criteria defined in the CIM Definition Standards (2014), and the\nMRMR Best Practice Guidelines (2019) for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction.\nThe economics of the resources were evaluated solely on the gold content within the mineralized domains. By product\nsilver resources reported are contained in those resource blocks that have potential economic viability based only on\nthe contained gold.\nMined Void Depletion\nAll current underground development at the Trixie deposit has been conducted by TCM and the void solids for this\ndevelopment have been surveyed, modelled, and kept up to date by TCM. The historically mined development at\nTrixie has been modelled by TCM, but to reduce the associated risk of uncertainty in void locations, a buffer solid of\n6.1 m (20 ft) was developed around the historical shapes. The historical buffers and the current development voids are\nused to deplete the final mineral resource of the Trixie deposit. As underground diamond drilling continues to intersect\nhistorically mined voids, the void shapes will be refined, reducing the uncertainty, and the depletion buffers may be\nreduced.\nTrixie Initial Mineral Resource Estimate Statement\nThe QPs have classified the Initial MRE as Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources based on data\ndensity, search ellipse criteria, and interpolation parameters. The Initial MRE is considered a reasonable representation\nof the mineral resources of the Trixie deposit based on the current quality data and geological knowledge. The Mineral\nResource Estimate follows the 2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves.\nTable 15 displays the results of the Initial MRE at the official 4.85 g/t Au cut-off grade for the Trixie deposit.\nPage D-21\nMineral Resource Grade Sensitivity Analysis\nTable 16 shows the cut-off grade sensitivity analysis of gold and silver for the Initial MRE. Prospective investors\nshould be cautioned that the figures provided in Table 16 should not be interpreted as a mineral resource statement.\nThe reported quantities and grade estimates at different cut-off grades are presented for the sole purpose of\ndemonstrating the sensitivity of the mineral resource model for gold to the selection of a reporting cut-off grades used\nin the sensitivity analysis, and it is the opinion of the QP that they meet the test for reasonable prospects of eventual\neconomic extraction at varying prices of gold or other underlying parameters used to calculate the cut-off grade.\nTable 15: Trixie Deposit Initial Mineral Resource Estimate Statement\nCut-Off Contained Grade Contained\nGrade Quantity Grade Gold Metal Silver Metal\nGold Silver\nClassification Gold (g/t) ('000 t) (g/t) ('000 oz) (g/t) ('000 oz)\nMeasured 4.85 11 190.61 67 195.53 69\nIndicated 4.85 225 20.17 146 43.73 316\nTotal Measured +\n4.85 236 28.08 213 50.77 385\nIndicated\nInferred 4.85 385 19.64 243 42.82 530\nNotes:\n(1) Effective date of the Initial MRE is January 10, 2023.\n(2) Mr. William Lewis P.Geo, of Micon International Limited and Alan S J San Martin, AusIMM(CP), of Micon International Limited have\nreviewed and validated the Initial MRE, and are independent \"Qualified Persons\" as defined in NI 43-101.

The east Tintic district has been a prolific mining area throughout most of its history with several past\nproducers located within the boundaries of the Corporation's Tintic Project.\nThe exploration, compilation and development work on the Trixie deposit conducted by ODV since its acquisition\nhave resulted in a better understanding of the geology and mineralization. Based upon the work, the Corporation has\nbeen able to undertake an initial mineral resource estimate for the Trixie deposit, which remains open at depth and\nalong strike.\nPage D-23\nMicon QPs have reviewed and validated the programs conducted by ODV which are the basis for the initial mineral\nrecourse estimate, as well as the mineral resource itself. It is Micon's QPs opinion that the underlying exploration\nprograms have been conducted according to industry best practices as outlined by CIM. Therefore, Micon's QPs\nbelieve that the initial mineral resource estimate can be used as the basis for further exploration and development work\nto expand the mineral resources and to begin to conduct work leading to the undertaking of a PEA for the Trixie\ndeposit.\nExploration Budget and Further Recommendations\nExploration Budget and Other Expenditures\nThe tables below summarize the estimated costs for completing the recommended drilling and exploration program\ncontained in the recommendations further described below. The budget is a cost estimate and guideline to complete\nthe work. The budget is divided into a two-phase approach, with the second phase contingent on the successful\ncompletion of the first.\nTintic Project, Recommended Budget for Further Work - Phase 1 (USD)\nCost/ft\n(approx.) All\nType of Activity included Quantity Total (USD)\nInfill and Exploration Drilling on Existing Resource $260/ft. 20,000 ft. $5,200,000\nRegional Drilling $260/ft 20,000 ft. $5,200,000\nSurface geochemical Surveys, Surface and Underground $1,500,000\nSampling and Mapping, GIS Compilation\nLiDAR Survey $55,000\nOperational Permits $1,000,000\nEnvironmental Studies $1,000,000\nUpdate Mineral Resource Estimate $200,000\nMetallurgical Test Work $150,000\nProperty Wide Activities Subtotal $14,305,000\nContingency (~10%) $1,430,500\nTotal Phase 1 $15,735,500\nTintic Project, Recommended Budget for Further Work - Phase 2 (USD)\nCost/ft\n(approx.) All\nType of Activity included Quantity Total (USD)\nAdditional Infill and Exploration Drilling on Existing $260/ft. 20,000 ft. $5,200,000\nResource\nAdditional Regional Drilling $260/ft 20,000 ft. $5,200,000\nCompletion of a PEA $2,000,000\nUnderground development for exploration ramp $2,500/ft 10,000 ft. $25,000,000\nContingency (~10%) $3,740,000\nTotal Phase 2 $41,140,000\nTotal Phase 1 and 2 $56,875,500\nIt is the opinion of the Micon QPs that all of the recommended work is warranted and that only the amount of\nexploration drilling on new targets needs to be finalized. Micon and its QPs' appreciate that the nature of the programs\nPage D-24\nand expenditures may change as the further studies are undertaken, and that the final expenditures and results may not\nbe the same as originally proposed.\nThe Micon QPs are of the opinion that the ODV's recommended work program and proposed expenditures are\nappropriate, warranted and well thought out. The Micon QPs believe that the proposed budget reasonably reflects the\ntype and amount of the activities required to advance the Trixie deposit.\nFurther Recommendations\nBased on the results of the Initial MRE, Micon's QPs recommend further exploration and development mineral\nresource estimate of Trixie deposit. It is recommended that ODV continues with underground exploration drilling at\nTrixie 625 L, together with continued face sampling and mapping along strike and down dip of the mineral resource\nand to infill areas currently defined as containing inferred resources. It is also recommended that, since the continued\nunderground face sampling has been beneficial to the development of the Tintic Project, exploration development\ncontinue in order to improve underground access from surface to the deeper levels of the mine. In addition to\nexploration at Trixie, it is recommended that ODV continue its exploration program on the other mineral targets on\nthe Tintic Property with continued surface mapping and sampling, data compilation and surface drilling of regional\nhigh sulphidation, CRD and porphyry targets.\nIt is recommended that ODV move to a PEA at Trixie, by conducting additional metallurgical work, along with further\nengineering studies on mining and reconciliation, continuing with environmental, permitting and community\nengagement and conducting a detailed economic analysis.\nIn summary, the following work program is recommended.\n1. Exploration work:\n(a) Conduct an additional approximately 6,000 m (20,000 ft.) of underground diamond drilling for\nexploration and delineation at Trixie, with primary focus on the T2 and T4 deposits.\n(b) Continue to develop a structural model with underground face and back mapping at Trixie.\n(c) Incorporate the remaining 2022 drill results and 2023 drill results into an updated Mineral Resource\nEstimate.\n(d) Continue generative work within the greater Tintic Project including geophysical interpretation,\nhistoric data compilation, and geologic modelling of high sulphidation targets at North Lily and\nEureka Standard, CRD targets at Tintic Standard and Burgin, and porphyry targets at Big Hill and\nSilver Pass areas.\n(e) Commence surface drilling of regional targets to potentially add further mineral resources in\nsecondary deposits.\n(f) Perform a LiDAR survey on the property for collection of surface imagery and for aiding in\nstructural interpretation.\n(g) Investigate the acquisition of a Bazooka drill to conduct short <25 m (<82 ft) drill holes in\nconjunction with development underground. This is separate from longer underground exploration\nholes from a set drilling station.\n(h) Investigate the use of conducting sludge sampling to investigate the lateral extent of the grade\napproximately up to 3.5 m in each wall of the drift as development progresses.\n(i) Conduct further density sampling for each of the geological domains.\nPage D-25\n(j) Continue construction of the Trixie ramp to make exploration more accessible and continue to\nimprove access to deeper levels for continuous face sampling.\n2. Burgin Onsite Assay Laboratory\n(a) Continue to undertake bi-annual independent inspections of the onsite assay laboratory. Depending\non the results of the inspections the time between reviews can be reassessed.\n(b) Have the onsite laboratory participate in independent assay round robins as part of its QA/QC\npractices.\n(c) Conduct regular screen metallic assays for all gold samples above a pre-determined grade, possibly\none ounce of gold per short ton.\n3. Metallurgical Testwork:\n(a) Leaching tests to optimize conditions in terms of precious metal recovery, capital costs and\noperating costs.\n(b) Comparative testwork and techno-economic study to compare heap, VAT and agitation leaching\ntechnologies.\n(c) Geochemical characterization testwork on representative feed and residue samples.\n(d) Appropriate additional comminution testing, depending on the most likely process flowsheet.\n(e) Variability testwork.\n4. Preliminary economic assessment:\n(a) Complete independent metallurgical testwork at the Trixie Test Mine. Conduct variability testwork\nand separate recoverability testwork for each zone. If the zones exhibit notable or significant\ndifferences in recoveries, incorporate into updated resource model.\n(b) Complete further geotechnical work.\n(c) Identify further permitting considerations and potential environmental studies for the Project\n(d) Continue with further community engagement and social license management.\n(e) Undertake further detailed economic analysis based upon engineering and metallurgical trade-off\nstudies.\nPage D-26"

The total amount of\ngross proceeds from the three tranches of Non-Brokered Subscription Receipts was approximately US$119.4 million. The gross\nproceeds of the Non-Brokered Offering were held in escrow pending, among other things, the completion of the listing of the Common\nShares on the NYSE (the “Non-Brokered Escrow Release Condition”), which was contingent upon Osisko Development meeting\nthe listing requirements of the NYSE and involved, among other things, a consolidation of the Common Shares. The Consolidation\nwas effective May 4, 2022 and the Common Shares began trading on the NYSE on May 27, 2022.\nOn February 9, 2022, Osisko Development announced a bought deal brokered private placement of initially an aggregate 9,000,000\nsubscription receipts of Osisko Development (the “Brokered Subscription Receipts”) and/or units of Osisko Development (the\n“Brokered Units” and, together with the Brokered Subscription Receipts, the “Brokered Offered Securities”) at a price of $4.45 per\nBrokered Offered Security (the “Brokered Offering”). Later on February 9, 2022, Osisko Development announced an up-size of the\nBrokered Offering to an aggregate of 20,225,000 Brokered Offered Securities at the same price, for aggregate gross proceeds of\n$90,001,250. Each Brokered Unit was comprised of one (1) pre-Consolidation Common Share and one (1) Warrant (a “Brokered\nWarrant”). A Brokered Warrant holder will be required to exercise three (3) whole Brokered Warrants in order to purchase one whole\npost-Consolidation Common Share for a total price of $22.80 for a period of 60 months following the closing date of the Brokered\nOffering. Each Brokered Subscription Receipt entitled the holder thereof to receive, upon the satisfaction of the Brokered Escrow\nRelease Condition , and without payment of additional consideration, one (1) Brokered Unit. Osisko Development granted the\nunderwriters under the Brokered Offering an option, exercisable in whole or in part up to 48 hours prior to the closing of the Brokered\nOffering, to purchase up to an additional aggregate amount of 3,033,750 Brokered Subscription Receipts and/or Brokered Units for\nadditional gross proceeds of up to $13,500,187.50. On March 2, 2022, Osisko Development announced the completion of the\nBrokered Offering of an aggregate of (i) 13,732,900 Brokered Subscription Receipts and (ii) 9,525,850 Brokered Units for aggregate\ngross proceeds of approximately $103.5 million, including the full exercise of the underwriters’ option. The gross proceeds from the\nsale of the Brokered Subscription Receipts, net of expenses of the underwriters and 50% of the commissions payable to the\nunderwriters in respect of the Brokered Subscription Receipts, were placed into escrow and released immediately prior to the\ncompletion of the acquisition by Osisko Development of Tintic (the “Brokered Escrow Release Condition”). On May 30, 2022, the\nBrokered Escrow Release Condition was met, and the gross proceeds of the Brokered Offering and accrued interest thereon, net of\nthe commission (including accrued interest thereon) and expenses payable to the underwriters of the Brokered Offering, were\nreleased to the Corporation and the Brokered Subscription Receipts were converted into the underlying securities.\nShare Consolidation\nOn May 4, 2022 the Corporation announced that, pursuant to a special resolution passed by shareholders on April 26, 2022, and to\nthe consolidation ratio subsequently approved by the Board, the consolidation of all of its issued and outstanding common shares on\nthe basis of one (1) post-Consolidation Common Share for every three (3) pre-Consolidation Common Shares was taking effect as of\nthe same day.\n14\nThe exercise price and number of Common Shares of the Corporation issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options,\nwarrants or other convertible securities was proportionately adjusted to reflect the Consolidation in accordance with the terms of the\nsecurities.\nNYSE Listing\nOn May 23, 2022, Osisko Development announced that it had been approved to list its Common Shares on the NYSE. The Common\nShares commenced trading on the NYSE on May 27, 2022 under the trading ticker symbol “ODV”.

The Corporation’s objective is to become a North American intermediate\nproducer of precious metals, through curating and advancing a portfolio of development projects and investments with potential for\nvalue creation. Its flagship mining asset is the Cariboo Gold Project, located in the District of Wells, British Columbia, Canada. Osisko\nDevelopment’s project pipeline is complemented by the Tintic Project, located in Utah, United States and the San Antonio Project,\nlocated in Sonora, Mexico. For further details regarding the material mineral projects of the Corporation, see “Schedule A – Technical\nInformation – Cariboo Gold Project” and “Schedule A – Technical Information – Tintic Project”.\n16\nAs of the date of this AIF, the Corporation considers the Cariboo Gold Project and the Tintic Project to be its only material mineral\nproperties for the purposes of NI 43-101. The board of directors has recently authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Project,\nwhich includes exploring the potential for a financial or strategic partner in the asset or for a full or partial sale of the asset. The\nCorporation has engaged a financial advisor in connection with such strategic review.\nIn addition, the Corporation’s assets include a portfolio of shares, mainly of Canadian publicly traded exploration and development\nmining companies. The Corporation may, from time to time and without further notice, except as required by law or regulations,\nincrease or decrease its investments at its discretion.\nThe following table presents the main investment of the Corporation in marketable securities as at March 31, 2023:\nCompany Number of Shares Held Ownership\nFalco Resources Ltd. 46,885,240 17.3%\nReorganizations\nWithin the three (3) most recently completed financial years, the Corporation completed the Reverse Takeover Transaction, which\nconstitute a material reorganization of the Corporation. See “General Development of Business – Three Year History – Fiscal Year\nEnded December 31, 2020 – Launch of Osisko Development Corp.”.\nSocial and Environmental Policies\nThe Corporation views sustainability as a key part of its strategy to create value for its shareholders and other stakeholders. The\nCorporation focuses on the following key areas: (i) promoting the mining industry and its benefits to society; (ii) maintaining strong\nrelationships with the Federal, Provincial, Municipal and First Nations governments where the Corporation has activities and projects;\n(iii) supporting the economic development of regions where it operates; (iv) promoting diversity throughout the organization and the\nmining industry; and (vi) encouraging investee companies to adhere to the same areas of focus in sustainability.\nFurther, the Corporation’s Code of Ethics provides basic guidelines setting forth the ethical behavior expected from every employee of\nthe Corporation with respect to the use of Corporation time and assets, protection of confidential information, conflicts of interest,\ntrading in the Corporation’s securities and other matters. The Code of Ethics specifically requires, among other things, that all\nemployees follow all applicable laws and regulations wherever the Corporation does business, work safely in accordance with\nregulatory and other industry standards, treat everyone fairly and equitably, work in an environmentally responsible manner and\nrespect the cultures and rights of communities where the Corporation operates its business. Strict adherence to the Code of Ethics is\na condition of employment with the Corporation and any breach thereof is cause for appropriate disciplinary action, which may include\ndismissal. The Corporation respects and supports the dignity, well-being and rights of its employees, their families and the\ncommunities in which it operates. The Corporation also sets out to build enduring relationships with its neighbours that demonstrate\nmutual respect, active partnership, and long-term commitment. The Corporation respects the diversity of Indigenous peoples\nacknowledging the unique and important interests that they have in the land, waters and environment as well as their history, culture\nand traditional ways.\nEnvironment and Sustainability Committee\nThe Environmental and Sustainability Committee is a committee of the Board to which the Board delegates its responsibility to\noversee certain health, safety, corporate social responsibility and environmental matters and to recommend to the Board the steps to\nbe taken in connection with these areas of activity.\n17\nThe Environmental and Sustainability Committee has the general mandate to: (i) review the corporate policies and guidelines,\nsystems and controls that are prepared and/or implemented by management in connection with the activities of the Corporation in\nrespect of the work environment (occupational health, safety and training matters), the human environment (corporate social\nresponsibility matters) and the physical environment (environmental matters); and (ii) deal with all matters relating to these three (3)\nareas of activities, including, without restriction, evaluating the Corporation’s overall performance in respect of the above-described\nareas of activities as well as how the work, human and physical environments affect the Corporation, make relevant\nrecommendations to the Board in respect of any of the foregoing, and oversee the implementation and administration thereof. The\nEnvironmental and Sustainability Committee held three (3) meetings during the financial year ended December 31, 2022.\nBusiness Cycles\nThe mining business is subject to global macro-economic cycles which affect the marketability of products derived from mining.\nForeign Operations\nOne of Osisko Development’s material projects, the Tintic Project, is located in Utah, United States. In addition, the San Antonio\nProject is also located in Mexico. See “Risk Factors – Risk Factors Related to the Corporation – Enforcing Judgments ”.\nSpecialized Skills\nThe Corporation’s business requires specialized skills and knowledge in the areas of geology, mining, mineral processing,\nenvironmental management, permitting, First Nations relations and the global commodity markets. To date, the Corporation has been\nable to locate and retain such professionals in Canada, the United States and Mexico, and believes it will be able to continue to do so.\n18\nEconomic Dependence\nThe Corporation’s business is not dependent on any contract to sell a major part of its products or to purchase a major part of its\nrequirements for goods, services or raw materials, or on any franchise or license or other agreement to use a patent, formula, trade\nsecret, process or trade name upon which its business depends. It is not expected that the Corporation’s business will be affected in\nthe current financial year by the renegotiation, amendment or termination of contracts or subcontracts.\nEmployees\nAs at December 31, 2022, the Corporation had 256 employees.\nCompetitive Conditions\nThe Corporation competes with other companies that focus on the discovery and acquisition of properties considered to have\ncommercial potential. The Corporation also competes with other precious metals focused companies for capital and human\nresources.\nSee “Risk Factors – Risk Factors Related to the Corporation – Competition”.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation’s business, being the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties in Canada and worldwide, is\nspeculative and involves a high degree of risk. The risk factors listed below could materially affect the Corporation’s financial condition\nand/or future operating results, and could cause actual events to differ materially from those described in Forward-Looking\nInformation relating to or made by the Corporation.\nIn evaluating the Corporation and its business, the readers should carefully consider the risk factors which follow and the risks set\nforth in the Corporation’s continuous disclosure documents filed on SEDAR and EDGAR. These risk factors may not be a definitive\nlist of all risk factors associated with an investment in the Corporation or in connection with its business and operations.\nThe risks described herein and in other documents forming part of the Corporation’s disclosure record are not the only risks facing the\nCorporation. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Corporation, or that the Corporation currently deems\nimmaterial, may also materially and adversely affect its business. Prospective purchasers or holders of Common Shares should give\ncareful consideration to all risk factors enumerated below.\n19\nRisk Factors Related to the Corporation\nMineral Exploration and Development\nMineral exploration and development is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. While the discovery of an ore body may result\nin substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are commercially mineable and ultimately developed into producing mines.\nThere is no assurance that any exploration properties will be commercially mineable.\nShould any mineral resources exist, substantial expenditures will be required to confirm mineral reserves which are sufficient to\ncommercially mine and to obtain the required environmental approvals and permitting required to commence commercial operations.\nThe decision as to whether a property contains a commercially viable mineral deposit and should be brought into production will\ndepend upon the results of exploration programs, preliminary economic assessment and/or feasibility studies, and the\nrecommendations of duly qualified engineers and/or geologists, all of which involves significant expense. This decision will involve\nconsideration and evaluation of several significant factors including, but not limited to: (a) costs of bringing a property into production,\nincluding exploration and development work, preparation of, if applicable, preliminary economic assessment and production feasibility\nstudies and construction of production facilities; (b) availability and costs of financing; (c) ongoing costs of production; (d) metal\nprices; (e) environmental compliance regulations and restraints (including potential environmental liabilities associated with historical\nexploration activities); and (f) political climate and/or governmental regulation and control. Development projects are also subject to\nthe successful completion of engineering studies, issuance of necessary governmental permits, and availability of adequate financing.\nDevelopment projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow.\nMining Operations\nMining operations are and will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration, development and production\nof mineral resources and mineral reserves including unusual or unexpected geological formations, geotechnical challenges and other\nconditions such as formation pressures, fire, power outages, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain\nsuitable machinery, equipment or labour, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property, and possible\nenvironmental damage that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate or adequately\nmitigate. The Corporation may be subject to liability for pollution, cave-ins or hazards against which it cannot insure or against which it\nmay elect not to insure. The payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Corporation.\nMajor expenditures are required to develop metallurgical processes and to construct mining and processing facilities at a particular\nsite. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are: the particular\nattributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which are highly volatile; and governmental\nregulations, including those relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, allowable production, importing and exporting of\nminerals and environmental protection.\nOperations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\nCertain operations of the Corporation including the test mining at Bonanza Ledge II Project, processing of the stockpile at the San\nAntonio Project (Sapuchi mine), and the small-scale test mining carried out at the Tintic Project, have been operated without the\nbenefit of a feasibility study including mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result, there may be\nincreased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. Historically, such projects\nhave a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that commercial production will commence,\ncontinue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to commence or continue production\nwould have a material adverse impact on the Corporation’s ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to\nachieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation’s cash flow and potential\nprofitability. In continuing current operations at Bonanza Ledge II Project and at the Tintic Project as well as commencing processing\nat San Antonio Project (Sapuchi mine), the Corporation will not be basing its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility\nstudy of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.\n20\nUnanticipated Metallurgical Processing Problems\nUnanticipated metallurgical processing problems may occur during operations, including, without limitation, mechanical problems with\nmilling or extraction equipment, unexpected grade anomalies in processed material, contaminants in processing or processed\nmaterial, and the inability to operate tested processes at scale which can lead to lower metallurgical recoveries than expected and\ndelay and impede operations, which may affect the potential profitability of the Corporation's material mineral properties. In addition,\nfurther metallurgical testing or operations may determine that the metals cannot be extracted as economically as anticipated.\nIndustry Conditions\nThe exploration for and development of mineral deposits involve significant risks and while the discovery of an ore body may result in\nsubstantial rewards, few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. All of the Corporation's\nproperties are in the development or exploration stage and the Corporation is presently not commercially exploiting any of its\nproperties and its future success will depend on its capacity to generate revenues from an exploited property.\nThe discovery of mineral deposits depends on a number of factors, including the professional qualification of its personnel in charge\nof exploration. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are the\nparticular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure, as well as metal prices which are highly cyclical\nand government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of\nminerals and environmental protection. In the event that the Corporation wishes to commercially exploit one of its properties, the\nexact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in the Corporation not\nreceiving an adequate return on invested capital. The Corporation's operations will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally\nencountered in the exploration and development of mineral deposits. Mining operations generally involve a high degree of risk,\nincluding unusual and unexpected geological formations.\nUncertainty of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates\nMineral resource and mineral reserve figures are only estimates. Mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates have inherent\nuncertainty. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on knowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results and\nindustry practices. While the Corporation believes that the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, as applicable, in respect\nof properties in which the Corporation holds a direct interest reflect best estimates, the estimating of mineral resources and mineral\nreserves is a subjective process and the accuracy of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates is a function of the quantity and\nquality of available data, the accuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting\navailable engineering and geological information. There is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource and mineral reserve\nestimate and the actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from estimates. Estimated\nmineral resources and mineral reserves may have to be re-estimated based on changes in prices of gold or other minerals, further\nexploration or development activity or actual production experience. This could materially and adversely affect estimates of the\nvolume or grade of mineralization, estimated recovery rates or other important factors that influence such estimates. In addition,\nmineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resource estimate will ultimately be\nreclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated\neconomic viability.\nNegative Operating Cash Flow\nFor the financial years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had negative operating cash flow of $50.3 million and\n$41.4 million, respectively, and also reported a net loss of $192.5 million and $133.3 million, respectively. For the same ending\nperiods, the Corporation had approximately $19.1 million and $13.6 million, respectively, in outstanding debt mainly related to leasing\nobligations. As a result of the expected expenditures to be incurred by the Corporation for the development of the Corporation's\nmaterial projects, the Corporation anticipates that negative operating cash flows will continue for the foreseeable future. There can be\nno assurance that the Corporation will generate positive cash flow from operations in the future. The Corporation will require\nsubstantial additional capital in order to fund its future exploration and development activities for its material projects. To the extent\nthat the Corporation continues to have negative operating cash\n21\nflow in future periods, it may need to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to fund such negative cash flow. Furthermore, significant\nadditional financing, whether through the issue of additional securities and/or debt, will be required to continue the development of the\nCorporation's material projects and there is no assurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available or that\nthese financings will be on terms at least as favourable to the Corporation as those previously obtained, or at all. Any failure to obtain\nadditional financing or failure to achieve profitability and positive operating cash flows will have a material adverse effect on its\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nNo Earnings and History of Losses\nThe business of developing and exploring resource properties involves a high degree of risk and, therefore, there is no assurance that\ncurrent exploration and test mining programs will result in profitable operations. The Corporation has not determined whether any of\nits properties contain economically recoverable reserves of mineralized material and currently has minimal or no revenues from its\nprojects; therefore, the Corporation does not generate sufficient cash flows from its operations. There can be no assurance that\nsignificant additional losses will not occur in the future. The Corporation’s operating expenses and capital expenditures may increase\nin future years with advancing exploration, development, and/or production from the Corporation’s properties. The Corporation does\nnot anticipate to receive sufficient revenues from operations to offset operational expenditures in the foreseeable future and expects\nto incur losses until such time as one or more of its properties enters into commercial production and generates sufficient revenues to\nfund continuing operations. There is no assurance that any of the Corporation’s properties will eventually graduate to commercial\noperation. There is also no assurance that new capital will become available, and if it is not, the Corporation may be forced to\nsubstantially curtail or cease operations.\nFinancing Risks and Additional Financing\nThe Corporation's operations are subject to financing risks and additional financing may result in dilution or partial sale of assets. At\nthe present time, the Corporation has exploration and development assets which may generate periodic revenues through test\nmining, but has no mines in the commercial production stage. The Corporation cautions that test mining at its operations could be\nsuspended at any time. The Corporation's ability to explore for and find potential economic projects, and then to bring them into\nproduction is highly dependent upon its ability to raise equity and debt capital in the financial markets. Any projects that the\nCorporation develops will require significant capital expenditures. Currently, the Corporation does not have any producing projects\nand no sources of revenue and any projects it develops will require significant capital expenditures. As a result, the Corporation may\nbe required to seek additional sources of debt and equity financing in the near future. To obtain such funds, the Corporation may sell\nadditional securities including, but not limited to, the Corporation's shares or some form of convertible security, the effect of which\ncould result in a substantial dilution of the equity interests of the Corporation's shareholders. Alternatively, the Corporation may also\nsell a part of its interest in an asset in order to raise capital. There is no assurance that the Corporation will be able to raise the funds\nrequired to continue its exploration programs and finance the development of any potentially economic deposit that is identified on\nacceptable terms or at all. The failure to obtain the necessary financing could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's\ngrowth strategy, results of operations, financial condition and project scheduling. The development of the Corporation's material\nmineral properties remains subject to, among other things, Osisko Development securing adequate financing on conditions\nacceptable to it.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Corporation’s activities are subject to governmental laws and regulations. These activities can be affected at various levels by\ngovernmental regulation governing prospecting and development, price control, taxes, labour standards and occupational health,\nexpropriation, mine safety, compliance with securities matters and other matters. Exploration and commercialization are subject to\nvarious federal, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws impose high\nstandards on the mining industry to monitor the discharge of wastewater and report the results of such monitoring to regulatory\nauthorities, to reduce or eliminate certain effects on or into land, water or air, to progressively rehabilitate mine properties, to manage\nhazardous wastes and materials and to reduce the risk of worker accidents.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions,\nincluding orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective\n22\nmeasures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could result in significant expenditures. The\nCorporation may also be required to compensate private parties suffering loss or damage by reason of a breach of such laws,\nregulations or permitting requirements. It is also possible that future laws and regulations, or more stringent enforcement of current\nlaws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or\nsuspensions of the Corporation’s activities and delays in the exploration and development of the projects and properties.\nAmendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies, or more stringent\nimplementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation and cause increases in capital expenditures or\ndevelopment costs or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties.\nAlso, no assurance can be made that the Canada Revenue Agency and provincial agencies will agree with the Corporation’s\ncharacterization of expenses as Canadian exploration expenses or Canadian development expenses or the eligibility of such\nexpenses as Canadian exploration expenses under the Tax Act or any provincial equivalent.\nTaxation Laws or Reviews\nThe Corporation has operations and conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and it is subject to the taxation laws of each such\njurisdiction. These taxation laws are complicated and subject to change. The Corporation may also be subject to review, audit and\nassessment in the ordinary course. Any such changes in taxation law or reviews and assessments could result in higher taxes being\npayable or require payment of taxes due from previous years, which could adversely affect the Corporation’s liquidities. Taxes may\nalso adversely affect the Corporation’s ability to repatriate earnings and otherwise deploy its assets.\nChanges in Economic and Political Conditions and Regulations\nThe economics of the exploration and development of mining projects are affected by many factors, including the costs of exploration\nand development, variations of grade of mineralized material discovered, fluctuations in metal prices, foreign exchange rates and the\nprices of goods and services, applicable laws and regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production and\nimporting and exporting goods and services. Depending on the price of minerals, the Corporation may determine that it is neither\npotentially profitable nor advisable to acquire or develop properties.\nThe Corporation’s mineral properties are located in Canada, the United States and Mexico. Economic and political conditions in these\ncountries could adversely affect the business activities of the Corporation. These conditions are beyond the Corporation’s control, and\nthere can be no assurance that any mitigating actions by the Corporation will be effective.\nChanging laws and regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions may increase the costs related to the\nCorporation’s activities including the cost of maintaining its properties. Operations may also be affected to varying degrees by\nchanges in government regulations with respect to restrictions on exploration and development activities, price controls, export\ncontrols, income taxes, royalties, expropriation of property, environmental legislation (including specifically legislation enacted to\naddress climate change) and mine safety. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted. Economic instability could result\nfrom current global economic conditions and could contribute to currency volatility and potential increases to income tax rates, both of\nwhich could significantly impact the Corporation’s potential profitability.\nThe Corporation’s activities are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing worker health and safety, employment standards,\nwaste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine development, protection of endangered and protected species\nand other matters. Regulators have broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations\nor standards.\nRisk factors specific to certain jurisdictions are described throughout, including specifically “Security in Mexico”. The occurrence of the\nvarious factors and uncertainties related to economic and political risks of operating in the Corporation’s jurisdictions cannot be\naccurately predicted and could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation.\n23\nEnforcing Judgments\nAs the Corporation is a Canadian corporation and most of its directors and officers reside in Canada, it may be difficult or impossible\nfor investors in the United States to effect service or to realize on judgments obtained in the United States predicated upon the civil\nliability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. A judgment of a U.S. court predicated solely upon such civil liabilities may be\nenforceable in Canada by a Canadian court if the U.S. court in which the judgment was obtained had jurisdiction, as determined by\nthe Canadian court, in the matter. Investors should not assume that Canadian courts: (i) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts\nobtained in actions against the Corporation or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities\nlaws or the securities or blue-sky laws of any state within the United States, or (ii) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against\nthe Corporation or such persons predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or any such state securities or blue-sky laws.\nSimilarly, some of the Corporation’s directors and officers are residents of countries other than Canada and all or a substantial portion\nof the assets of such persons are located outside Canada and some of the Corporation’s mineral assets, including the Tintic Project,\nare located outside of Canada and are held indirectly through foreign affiliates. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for\nCanadian investors to initiate a lawsuit within Canada against these persons or to enforce judgments in Canada against such assets.\nIn addition, it may not be possible for Canadian investors to collect from these persons or assets judgments obtained in courts in\nCanada predicated on the civil liability provisions of securities legislation of certain of the provinces and territories of Canada. It may\nalso be difficult or impossible for Canadian investors to succeed in a lawsuit in the United States based solely on violations of\nCanadian Securities Laws.\nPermits, Licences and Approvals\nThe operations of the Corporation require licences and permits from various governmental authorities. The Corporation believes it\nholds or is in the process of obtaining all necessary licences and permits to carry on the activities, which it is currently conducting\nunder applicable laws and regulations. Such licences and permits are subject to changes in regulations and in various operating\ncircumstances. There can be no guarantee that the Corporation will be able to obtain all necessary licences and permits that may be\nrequired to maintain its business operations, mining activities, construct mines or milling facilities and commence operations of any of\nits exploration properties. In addition, if the Corporation proceeds to production on any exploration property, it must obtain and comply\nwith permits and licences which may contain specific conditions concerning operating procedures, water use, the discharge of various\nmaterials into or on land, air or water, waste disposal, spills, environmental studies, abandonment and restoration plans and financial\nassurances. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to obtain such permits and licences or that it will be able to\ncomply with any such conditions.\nLocal Communities, Indigenous Peoples and First Nations\nIndigenous title claims, rights to consultation/accommodation and the Corporation’s relationship with local communities may affect the\nCorporation’s existing exploration and development projects. Governments in many jurisdictions must consult with Indigenous\npeoples and First Nations with respect to grants of mineral rights or surface rights and the issuance or amendment of project\nauthorizations. Consultation and other rights of Indigenous peoples and First Nations may require accommodations, including\nundertakings regarding employment, royalty payments and other matters. This may affect the Corporation’s ability to acquire, within a\nreasonable time frame, effective mineral titles or surface rights in these jurisdictions, including in some parts of Canada, Mexico and\nthe United States, in which Indigenous or local communities’ titles are claimed, and may affect the timetable and costs of development\nof mineral properties in these jurisdictions. The risk of unforeseen Indigenous title claims also could affect exploration and\ndevelopment projects. These legal requirements may also affect the Corporation’s ability to transfer existing projects or to develop\nnew projects.\nThe Corporation’s relationship with the communities in which it conducts activities are critical to ensure the future success of its\nexisting activities and the exploration and development of its projects. There is an increasing level of public concern relating to the\nperceived effect of mining activities on the environment and on communities impacted by such activities. Adverse publicity relating to\nthe mining industry generated by non-governmental organizations and others could have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s\nreputation or financial condition and may impact its relationship with the communities in which it conducts activities. While the\nCorporation is committed to working in a socially responsible manner, there is no guarantee that the Corporation’s efforts in this\nregard will mitigate this potential risk.\n24\nThe inability of the Corporation to maintain positive relationships with local communities may result in additional obstacles to\npermitting, increased legal challenges, or other disruptive operational issues at any of the Corporation’s projects, and could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the Corporation’s share price and financial condition.\nEnvironmental Risks and Hazards\nThe Corporation is subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations mandate, among\nother things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the general,\ntransportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will\nrequire stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental\nassessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and\nemployees. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect the Corporation's\noperations. Environmental hazards may exist on the properties which are unknown to the Corporation at present and which have\nbeen caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the properties. Reclamation costs are uncertain and planned\nexpenditures estimated by management may differ from the actual expenditures required.\nCompetition\nThe Corporation’s activities are directed towards the exploration, evaluation and development of mineral deposits. There is no\ncertainty that the expenditures to be made by the Corporation will result in discoveries of commercial quantities of mineral deposits.\nThere is aggressive competition within the mining industry for the discovery and acquisition of properties considered to have\ncommercial potential. The Corporation will compete with other interests, many of which have greater financial resources than it will\nhave, for the opportunity to participate in promising projects. Significant capital investment is required to achieve commercial\nproduction from successful exploration efforts, and the Corporation may not be able to successfully raise funds required for any such\ncapital investment.\nAnti-Bribery Laws\nThe Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other\njurisdictions where the Corporation does business, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for\nthe purposes of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. The Corporation’s policies mandate compliance with\nthese anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. The Corporation operates in jurisdictions that have experienced\ngovernmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws\nmay conflict with certain local customs and practices. There can be no assurances that the Corporation’s internal control policies and\nprocedures will always protect it from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by the Corporation’s affiliates, employees or\nagents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nManagement\nThe Corporation is dependent on certain members of its management, particularly its Chief Executive Officer. The loss of their\nservices could adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to grow its business, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Corporation’s business and financial condition. The Corporation is dependent on the services of key\nexecutives and other highly skilled personnel focused on advancing its corporate objectives as well as the identification of new\nopportunities for growth and funding. The loss of these persons or its inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees\nrequired for its activities may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business and financial condition. Further, while\ncertain of the Corporation’s officers and directors have experience in the exploration, development and operation of mineral\nproperties, the Corporation remains highly dependent upon contractors and third parties in the performance of their exploration and\ndevelopment activities. There can be no guarantee that such contractors and third parties will be available to carry out such activities\non behalf of the Corporation or be available upon commercially acceptable terms.\n25\nImplementation of Business Strategy\nThere can be no assurance that Osisko Development's management team will be successful in implementing its strategy (including\nas set out in this AIF) or that past results will be reproduced going forward. The management team may experience difficulties in\neffecting key strategic goals such as the growth and investment in tier one assets, tier two assets and strategic assets, the sale of\nnon-core assets or the development of exploration projects. The performance of the Corporation's operations could be adversely\naffected if its management team cannot implement the stated business strategy effectively.\nConflicts of Interest\nCertain directors and officers of the Corporation also serve as directors and officers of other companies involved in natural resource\nexploration and development. Consequently, there is a possibility that such directors and officers will be in a position of conflict of\ninterest. Any decision made by such directors and officers involving the Corporation will be made in accordance with their duties and\nobligations to deal fairly and in good faith with the Corporation and such other companies. In addition, such directors will declare, and\nrefrain from voting on, any matter in which such directors may have a material conflict of interest.\nFactors Beyond the Control of Osisko Development\nThe potential profitability of mineral properties is dependent upon many factors beyond the Corporation’s control. For instance, world\nprices of and markets for minerals are unpredictable, highly volatile, potentially subject to governmental fixing, pegging and/or\ncontrols and respond to changes in domestic, international, political, social and economic environments. Another factor is that rates of\nrecovery of minerals from mined mineralized material (assuming that such mineral deposits are known to exist) may vary from the\nrate experienced in tests and a reduction in the recovery rate will adversely affect potential profitability and, possibly, the economic\nviability of a property. Profitability will also depend on the costs of operations, including costs of labour, equipment, electricity,\nenvironmental compliance or other production inputs. Such costs will fluctuate in ways the Corporation cannot predict and are beyond\nthe Corporation’s control, and such fluctuations will impact on profitability and may eliminate the Corporation’s ability to achieve\nprofitability altogether, or if achieved, its ability to maintain profitability. Additionally, due to worldwide economic uncertainty, (i) the\navailability and cost of funds for development and other costs have become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to project; and (ii)\nglobal supply chain may also be negatively affected. These changes and events may materially affect the financial performance of the\nCorporation and they may also negatively impact the project schedule.\nLack of Insurance Coverage\nThe Corporation may be subject to liability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards against which it does not or cannot\neconomically insure, taking into consideration the importance of the premiums or other reasons. Mining is capital intensive and\nsubject to a number of risks and hazards, including environmental pollution, accidents or spills, industrial and transportation\naccidents, labour disputes, changes in the regulatory environment, natural phenomena (such as inclement weather conditions,\nearthquakes, pit wall failures and cave-ins) and encountering unusual or unexpected geological conditions. Such risk and hazards\nmight impact the Corporation’s business. Consequently, many of the foregoing risks and hazards could result in damage to, or\ndestruction of, the Corporation’s mineral properties or future processing facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage,\ndelays in or interruption of or cessation of their exploration or development activities, delay in or inability to receive required regulatory\napprovals, or costs, monetary losses and potential legal liability and adverse governmental action. The Corporation may be subject to\nliability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards against which it does not or cannot insure or against which it may reasonably\nelect not to insure because of the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could result in material economic harm to the Corporation.\nFluctuation in Market Value\nThe price of the Common Shares has been and may continue to be volatile. For example, the price per Common share peaked at a\nhigh price of $26.59 per Common Share in February, 2021, shortly following the completion of the Reverse Takeover Transaction, and\nhas since declined significantly, reaching a low of $3.98 per Common Share in April 2022 2022 ($6.55 per Common Share on March\n30, 2023), all on a post-Consolidation basis. Securities markets have a high level of\n26\nprice and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations in price,\nincluding as a result of factors outside of such companies’ control. The price of the Common Shares is affected by the Corporation’s\nfinancial conditions or results of operations as reflected in its liquidity position and earnings reports. The price of the Common Shares\nmay also be affected by factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the Corporation, including macroeconomic\ndevelopments in North America, Mexico and globally, and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries, which may\nincrease the volatility of Common Share prices. These include the risks described elsewhere in this AIF.\nOther factors which may influence the price of the Corporation’s securities, including the Common Shares, include, but are not limited\nto: worldwide economic conditions; changes in government policies; investor perceptions; movements in global interest rates and\nglobal stock markets; variations in operating costs; the cost of capital that the Corporation may require in the future; metals prices; the\nprice of commodities necessary for the Corporation’s operations; recommendations by securities research analysts; issuances of\nCommon Shares or debt securities by the Corporation; exploration and development successes and, if applicable, the share price\nperformance of the Corporation’s competitors; the addition or departure of key management and other personnel; significant\nacquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Corporation or\nits competitors; news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other\nrelated industry and market issues affecting the mining sector; publicity or other third party statements or coverage about the\nCorporation (including its prospects and strategy) and its personnel; loss of a major funding source; and all market conditions that are\nspecific to the mining industry. There can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not affect the price and liquidity of the\nCorporation’s securities. In addition, a substantial decline in the price of the Common Shares that persists for a significant period of\ntime could cause the Corporation’s securities to be delisted from the NYSE and/or the TSX-V, further reducing market liquidity.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their\nsecurities. The Corporation may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and\ndamages and divert management’s attention and resources.\nFurther, the Corporation’s public disclosure record is available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) and, to\nthat end, the Corporation does not endorse, and provides no assurance in respect of, any third party statements or coverage about\nthe Corporation.\nCompletion of Announced Transactions\nFrom time to time the Corporation may enter into binding transactions to acquire assets such as mining companies, metals or mineral\nprojects and properties. There can be no assurances the Corporation will successfully complete any announced transactions as a\nvariety of conditions may exist that need to be waived or satisfied prior to completion. There can be no certainty that proposed\nbenefits of transactions to acquire such assets will be realized as anticipated.\nExploration for metals and minerals is a speculative venture necessarily involving substantial risk. There is no certainty that the\nexpenditures on any given project will result in discoveries of commercial quantities of minerals.\nIf mineable deposits are discovered, substantial expenditures are required to establish reserves through drilling, to develop processes\nto extract the resources and, in the case of new properties, to develop the extraction and processing facilities and infrastructure at any\nsite chosen for extraction. Although substantial benefits may be derived from the discovery of a major deposit, no assurance can be\ngiven that resources will be discovered in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for\ndevelopment can be obtained on terms acceptable to the Corporation or at all.\nMergers, Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Integration\nFrom time to time, Osisko Development examines opportunities to acquire, merge and joint venture assets and businesses or\nconduct any other type of transaction. Global landscape has changed and there are risks associated to such transactions due to\nliabilities and evaluations with the aggressive timelines of closing transactions from increased competition. There is also a risk that the\nreview and examination process might be inadequate and cause material negative outcomes. Any transaction that the Corporation\nmay choose to complete may be of a significant size, may change the scale of the Corporation's business and operations, and may\nexpose it to new or greater geographic, political, operating, financial, legal\n27\nand geological risks. The Corporation's success in its acquisition activities depends on its ability to identify suitable acquisition\ncandidates, negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and integrate the acquired operations successfully with those of the\nCorporation. Any transactions would be accompanied by risks, including those related to changes in commodity prices after the\nCorporation has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; an ore body being\nbelow expectations; difficulty integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies (which may be\ncompounded by geographical separation, unanticipated costs, and the loss of key employees), realizing anticipated synergies and\nmaximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies, procedures\nand controls across the organization; integration of the acquired business or assets diverting the attention of management or disrupt\nthe Corporation's ongoing business and its relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and contractors; dilution of the\nCorporation's interests in its assets, including by the decision to grant interests to a joint venture partner; an acquired business or\nassets having unknown liabilities which may be significant. In the event that the Corporation chooses to raise debt capital, it may\nreduce its financial flexibility as the Corporation services interest and debt repayments. If the Corporation chooses to use equity as\nconsideration for any such transaction, existing shareholders may suffer dilution. In addition, many companies in the mining industry\nhave recently seen substantial downward pressure on their equity values after announcing significant transactions. There is a risk that\nif Osisko Development was to announce a significant acquisition, the value of the Common Shares could decrease over the short-,\nmedium- and/or long-term. The Corporation cannot assure that it can complete any transaction that it pursues, or is pursuing, on\nfavorable terms, or that any transactions completed will ultimately benefit the Corporation's business. There can be no assurance that\nthe Corporation would be successful in overcoming the risks noted above or any other problems encountered in connection with such\ntransactions or joint ventures. There may be no right for shareholders to evaluate the merits or risks of any future transaction or joint\nventure undertaken except as required by applicable laws and regulations.\nPotential Fraud and Corruption\nThe Corporation is subject to risks related to potential to gain benefits from improper transactions and financial reporting to hide\noperational deficiencies or enhance remuneration. Other risks include the potential for fraud and corruption by suppliers, personnel or\ngovernment officials and which may implicate the Corporation, and its compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws. The\nCorporation’s internal controls might not be sufficient or sophisticated enough to identify adequately all potential fraud and corruption.\nSecurity in Mexico\nIn recent years, criminal activity and violence have increased and continue to increase in certain parts of Mexico. The mining sector\nhas not been immune to the impact of criminal activity and violence, including in the form of kidnapping for ransom and extortion by\norganized crime, direct armed robberies of mining operations and the theft and robbery of supply convoys, including specifically for\ndiesel. The Corporation takes measures to protect employees, property and production facilities from these and other security risks.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that security incidents, in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nLabour Relations\nThe Corporation is dependent on its ability to maintain positive relationships with its employees and there can be no assurance that\nthe Corporation will be able to continue to do so in the future. In addition, relations between the Corporation and its employees may\nbe impacted by regulatory or governmental changes introduced by the relevant authorities in whose jurisdictions the Corporation\ncarries on business as well as by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse changes in such legislations or in the relationship between the\nCorporation and its employees could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nSignificant Influence of Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd.\nAs of the date hereof, Osisko Gold Royalties owns 33,333,366 Common Shares, representing approximately 39.9% of the\noutstanding Common Shares. As a significant shareholder of the Corporation, Osisko Gold Royalties may exercise significant\ninfluence over all matters requiring approval of the shareholders of the Corporation, including the election of directors, determination\nof significant corporate actions, amendments to the Corporation's articles of incorporation and the\n28\napproval of any business combinations, mergers or takeover attempts, in a manner that could conflict with the interests of other\nshareholders of the Corporation.\nUncertainty of Ownership Rights and Boundaries of Resource Properties\nThere is no assurance that the rights of ownership and other rights in concessions held by the Corporation are not subject to loss or\ndispute, particularly because such rights may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers or other land claims and may\nbe affected by defects and adverse laws and regulations which have not been identified by the Corporation. There is no guarantee\nthat title to the properties will not be challenged or impugned. The Corporation’s property interest may be subject to prior unregistered\nagreements or transfers or native land claims and title may be affected by undetected defects.\nThird Party Approvals\nThe Corporation may require the consent or approval of third parties in order to enter into or complete certain agreements or\ntransactions necessary in the course of its operations. There can be no assurance that such third parties, which may include\nshareholders, regulatory bodies or entities with an interest in the applicable property or others (including water supply management\nand availability), will provide the required approval or consent or enter into such agreement in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to\nobtain such third party approval may result in a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations and financial condition.\nCommunity Relations, Social License and Land Claim\nMaintaining a positive relationship with the communities in which the Corporation operates is critical to its business operations and the\ndevelopment of the Cariboo Project and Tintic Project.\nThe Corporation may come under pressure to demonstrate that other stakeholders (including employees, communities surrounding\noperations and their respective countries) benefit and will continue to benefit from its commercial activities, and/or that it operates in a\nmanner that will minimize any potential damage or disruption to the interests of those stakeholders.\nErosion of social licence or activities of third parties seeking to call into question social licence may have the effect of slowing down\nthe development of new projects and potentially may increase the cost of constructing and operating these projects. Productivity may\nbe reduced due to restriction of access, proceedings initiated or delays in permitting, and there may also be extra costs associated\nwith improving the relationship with the surrounding communities.\nWhile the Corporation is committed to operating in a socially responsible manner and working towards entering into agreements in\nsatisfaction of such requirements there is no guarantee that its efforts will be successful, in which case interventions by third parties\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial position and operations.\nReliance on Historical Data\nAlthough the Corporation’s normal data verification procedures have been employed in connection with the calculations of the mineral\nresource estimation on the Cariboo Project and sampling, analytical and test data underlying the estimated mineral resources have\nbeen verified by qualified persons, an extensive amount of historical data and records on the Cariboo Project was relied on in\nestablishing these calculations. The Corporation cannot provide any comfort that it can rely upon, verify or necessarily authenticate\nsuch historical information in connection with its exploitation of the Cariboo Project. The Corporation cannot guarantee that the\nhistorical records that are available are free from material errors or inaccuracies. While the Corporation believes that the mineral\nresource and mineral reserve estimates in respect of its Cariboo Project reflect best estimates, the estimating of mineral resources is\na subjective process and the accuracy of mineral resource estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, the\naccuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting available engineering and\ngeological information. There is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource estimate, and the actual deposits encountered and the\neconomic viability of a deposit may differ materially from estimates.\n29\nReputational Risks\nReputational risk is the risk that an activity undertaken by an organization or its representatives will impair its image in the community\nor lower public confidence in it, resulting in loss of revenue, legal action or increased regulatory oversight and loss of valuation and\nshare price. Possible sources of reputational risk could come from, but are not limited to, operational failures, non-compliance with\nlaws and regulations or leading an unsuccessful financing. In addition to its risk management policies, controls and procedures, the\nCorporation has a formal Code of Ethics to help manage and support Osisko Development’s reputation.\nInfrastructure, Supplies and Inflation\nThe availability of skilled labour, electricity and other necessary supplies at an economic cost cannot be assured. These are integral\nrequirements for exploration, development and production facilities on mineral properties. Prices for goods and services will fluctuate\nin relation to the level of investment in the mining sector; it is reasonable to expect that increased demand could impact the\nCorporation’s future economic projections and competitiveness, as it may entail a meaningful increase in costs for various goods and\nservices.\nImprovements in the economic conditions for the mining industry as a whole will typically result in increases to both the costs of\nplanned exploration and development activities, which must also be factored into economic models used in projections for future\ndevelopment and potential operations. Increased demand for, and costs of, goods or services could result in delays if they cannot be\nobtained in a timely manner due to inadequate availability, and may cause scheduling difficulties and delays due to the need to\ncoordinate their availability, any of which could materially increase project exploration, development and/or construction costs. These\nfactors could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation’s operations and financial results.\nCybersecurity Threats and Information Technology Systems\nOsisko Development is dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of its operations. The Corporation could be\nadversely affected by network disruptions from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches,\ncyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity threats include attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or\nautomated network systems and the manipulation or improper use of information technology systems.\nA failure of any part of the Corporation’s information technology systems could, depending on the nature of such failure, materially\nadversely impact the Corporation’s reputation, financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation is subject to\ncybersecurity attacks and related threats from time to time. Although to date the Corporation has not experienced any material losses\nrelating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that it will not incur such losses in the\nfuture. The risk and exposure to these matters cannot be fully mitigated because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these\nthreats. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Corporation may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or\nenhance protective measures or to investigate and remediate any system vulnerabilities. In addition, the Corporation’s insurance\ncoverage for cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses it may experience as a result of a cyber incident. The\nCorporation and its third party service providers also collects, uses, discloses, stores, transmits and otherwise processes customer,\nsupplier and employee and others’ data as part of its business and operations, which may include personal data or confidential or\nproprietary information. There can be no assurance that any security measures that the Corporation or its third-party service providers\nhave implemented will be effective against current or future security threats. If a compromise of such data were to occur, the\nCorporation may become liable under its contracts with other parties and under applicable law for damages and incur penalties and\nother costs to respond to, investigate and remedy such an incident. Depending on the facts and circumstances of such an incident,\nthese damages, penalties, fines and costs could be significant. Any such event could harm the Corporation’s reputation and result in\nlitigation against it.\nThe Corporation’s operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment information\ntechnology systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risk of failure. Any of these or other events could\nresult in information system failures, delays and/or increases in capital expenditures. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature\nand scope of information technology disruptions, the Corporation could potentially be\n30\nsubject to production downtimes, operational delays, destruction or corruption of data, any of which could have a material adverse\neffect on the Corporation’s cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. From time to time, Osisko\nDevelopment pursues investments and initiatives to improve the productivity and efficiency of existing systems and operations,\nincluding through investments in digital technologies. There can be no certainty that some or any of such investments and initiatives\nwill meet the Corporation’s capital allocation objectives. In addition, certain of such investments and initiatives are still in the early\nstages of evaluation, and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact. Further, there can be no\ncertainty as to the time required for the Corporation to extract value from these investments or initiatives, or that the Corporation will\nachieve any anticipated savings or efficiency improvements.\nEquipment Shortages and Access Restrictions\nThe Corporation’s interest in its material mineral properties will require adequate infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and sources of\npower and water, for future exploration and development activities. The lack of availability of these items on terms acceptable to the\nCorporation or the delay in availability of these items could prevent or delay exploitation or development of the Corporation’s mineral\nproperties. Natural resource exploration, development, processing and mining activities are dependent on the availability of mining,\ndrilling and related equipment in the particular areas where such activities are conducted. A limited supply of such equipment or\naccess restrictions may affect the availability of such equipment to the Corporation and may delay exploration, development or\nextraction activities. Certain equipment may not be immediately available, or may require long lead time orders. A delay in obtaining\nnecessary equipment could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations and financial results.\nLitigation, the Causes and Costs of Which Cannot Be Known\nThe Corporation is subject to litigation arising in the normal course of business and may be involved in disputes with other parties in\nthe future which may result in litigation. The causes of potential future litigation cannot be known and may arise from, among other\nthings, business activities, environmental laws, volatility in stock price or failure or alleged failure to comply with disclosure\nobligations. The results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Corporation is unable to resolve litigation favourably,\neither by judicial determination or settlement, it may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial performance and\nresults of operations.\nIn the event of a dispute involving the foreign operations of the Corporation, the Corporation may be subject to the exclusive\njurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in Canada. The\nCorporation’s ability to enforce its rights could have a material adverse effect on its future cash flows, earnings, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nDividend Policy\nNo dividends on the Common Shares have been declared or paid to date. The Corporation anticipates that, for the foreseeable future,\nit will retain future earnings and other cash resources for the operation and development of its business. Payment of any future\ndividends will be at the discretion of the Board after taking into account many factors, including the Corporation’s earnings, operating\nresults, financial condition, and current and anticipated cash needs and any restrictions in financing agreements, and the Corporation\nmay never pay dividends.\nSales by Existing Shareholders\nSales of a substantial number of Common Shares in the public market by existing shareholders could occur, including by our largest\nshareholder, Osisko Gold Royalties, which held approximately 39.9% of our Common Shares as of the date hereof. These sales, or\nthe market perception that the holders of a large number of Common Shares intend to sell Common Shares, could reduce the market\nprice of the Common Shares. This could impair the Corporation’s ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities.\nPublic Company Obligations\nAs a dual-listed public corporate entity, the Corporation is subject to evolving rules and regulations promulgated by a number of\ngovernmental and self-regulated organizations, including the Canadian Securities Administrators, the TSX-V, the SEC, the NYSE and\nthe International Accounting Standards Board, which govern corporate governance and public disclosure\n31\nregulations. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating many new requirements, which increase\ncompliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. The Corporation’s efforts to comply with these rules and obligations could result in\nincreased general and administration expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from financing, development,\noperations and, eventually, revenue-generating activities. See also “U.S. Public Company Costs” below.\nImpairment of Assets\nIFRS requires that the Corporation review for indicators of impairment of the carrying value of its mining assets, and to test for\nimpairment when those indicators are present. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective\nimpairment reviews, production data, economics and other factors, the Corporation may be required to record additional write downs\nof its mining assets. The Corporation reviews and evaluates the carrying amount of its mining assets for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that such a mining asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value\nexceeds the estimated recoverable amount of such mining asset, the Corporation would record an impairment charge for any excess\nof the carrying value of the mining assets over the estimated fair value of such assets. Factors used to estimate fair value may include\nestimates of mineral resources and reserves, expected recoverable ore reserves, grade per ounce, recovery rates, future commodity\nprices, future production estimates and a commensurate discount rate. The Corporation recorded an impairment of assets related to\nthe Corporation's San Antonio and Cariboo Gold Projects during the year ended December 31, 2022. The risk that the Corporation\nwill be required to recognize additional impairments of its mining assets increases during periods of low commodity prices, high\nindustry cost pressures and high inflation. Moreover, additional impairments would occur if the Corporation were to experience\nsufficient downward adjustments to its estimated mineral resources or reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues.\nAn impairment recognized in one period may be reversed in a subsequent period. The Corporation may incur additional impairment\ncharges in the future, which could materially adversely affect its results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nCompliance with Listing Standards\nThe Corporation must meet continuing listing standards to maintain the listing of the Common Shares on the TSX-V and the NYSE,\nincluding minimum price of such Common Shares. If the Corporation fails to comply with listing standards and the TSX-V or NYSE\ndelists the Common Shares, the Corporation and its Shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a\nlimited availability of market quotations for the Common Shares; reduced liquidity for the Common Shares; a determination that the\nCommon Shares are “penny stock,” which would require brokers trading in the Common Shares to adhere to more stringent rules and\npossibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the Common Shares; a limited amount of news\nabout the Corporation and analyst coverage; and a decreased ability for the Corporation to issue additional equity securities or obtain\nadditional equity or debt financing in the future.\nU.S. Public Company Costs\nAs a public company in the United States, the Corporation incurs additional legal, accounting, NYSE, reporting and other expenses\nthat it did not incur as a public company in Canada. The additional demands associated with being a U.S. public company may\ndisrupt regular operations of the Corporation’s business by diverting the attention of some of its senior management team away from\nrevenue-producing activities to additional management and administrative oversight, adversely affecting the Corporation’s ability to\nattract and complete business opportunities and increasing the difficulty in both retaining professionals and managing and growing its\nbusiness. Any of these effects could harm the Corporation’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Corporation’s efforts to comply with new U.S. laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or\ngoverning bodies, such regulatory bodies or third parties may initiate legal proceedings against the Corporation and its business may\nbe adversely affected. As a public company in the United States, it is more expensive for the Corporation to obtain director and officer\nliability insurance, and the Corporation is and will be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to\ncontinue its coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for the Corporation to attract and retain qualified directors.\n32\nThe U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002, as amended (the “U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), requires that the Corporation maintain effective\ndisclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct (“Section 404”), the Corporation is required to furnish a report by its management on the Corporation’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting (“ICFR”), which, if or when the Corporation is no longer an emerging growth company, must be accompanied by an\nattestation report on ICFR issued by the Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nTo achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, the Corporation will document and evaluate its ICFR, which is\nboth costly and challenging. In this regard, the Corporation needs to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage\noutside consultants and maintain a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of the Corporation's ICFR, continue\nsteps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and\nimplement a continuous reporting and improvement process for ICFR. Despite the Corporation's efforts, there is a risk that neither it\nnor its independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that the Corporation's\nICFR is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in a determination that there are one or more material weaknesses in\nthe Corporation's ICFR, which could cause an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of\nthe Corporation's consolidated financial statements. In addition, in the event that the Corporation is not able to demonstrate\ncompliance with the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is perceived as\ninadequate, or that the Corporation is unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in its\noperating results and the price of the Common Shares may decline. In addition, if the Corporation is unable to continue to meet these\nrequirements, the Corporation may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE.\nForeign Private Issuer\nThe Corporation is a \"foreign private issuer\" as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended,\nand is permitted, under a multijurisdictional disclosure system adopted by the United States and Canada, to prepare its disclosure\ndocuments filed under the U.S. Exchange Act, in accordance with Canadian disclosure requirements. Under the U.S. Exchange Act,\nthe Corporation is subject to reporting obligations that, in certain respects, are less detailed and less frequent than those of U.S.\ndomestic reporting companies. As a result, the Corporation will not file the same reports that a U.S. domestic issuer would file with the\nSEC, although it will be required to file or furnish to the SEC the continuous disclosure documents that it is required to file in Canada\nunder Canadian Securities Laws. In addition, the Corporation's officers, directors, and principal Shareholders are exempt from the\nreporting and \"short swing\" profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the U.S. Exchange Act. Therefore, the Corporation's\nShareholders may not know on a timely basis when the Corporation's officers, directors and principal Shareholders purchase or sell\nshares, as the reporting deadlines under the corresponding Canadian insider reporting requirements are longer.\nAs a foreign private issuer, the Corporation is exempt from the rules and regulations under the U.S. Exchange Act related to the\nfurnishing and content of proxy statements. The Corporation is also exempt from Regulation FD, which prohibits issuers from making\nselective disclosures of material non-public information. While the Corporation expects to comply with the corresponding\nrequirements relating to proxy statements and disclosure of material non-public information under Canadian Securities Laws, these\nrequirements differ from those under the U.S. Exchange Act and Regulation FD and Shareholders should not expect to receive in\nevery case the same information at the same time as such information is provided by U.S. domestic companies.\nIn addition, as a foreign private issuer, the Corporation has the option to follow certain Canadian corporate governance practices,\nexcept to the extent that such laws would be contrary to U.S. Securities laws, and provided that the Corporation discloses the\nrequirements it is not following and describes the Canadian practices the Corporation follows instead. For example, the Corporation\ndoes not intend to follow the minimum quorum requirements for shareholder meetings as well as certain shareholder approval\nrequirements prior to the issuance of securities under NYSE listing standards, as permitted for foreign private issuers. As a result, the\nCorporation's Shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of U.S. domestic companies that are subject\nto all U.S. corporate governance requirements.\n33\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Corporation is an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. The Corporation\nwill remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the Corporation has a\ntotal annual gross revenue of US$1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the first\nsale of equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement occurs; (iii) the date on which the Corporation has issued more\nthan US$1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period; or (iv) the date the Corporation qualifies as a\n\"large accelerated filer\" under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of the Common Shares held by non-affiliates\nexceeds US$700 million as of the last business day of the Corporation's most recently completed second fiscal quarter after it has\nbeen a reporting company in the United States for at least 12 months. For so long as the Corporation remains an emerging growth\ncompany, it is permitted to and intends to rely upon exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other\npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor\nattestation requirements of Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nThe Corporation may take advantage of some, but not all, of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies. The\nCorporation cannot predict whether investors will find the Common Shares less attractive if the Corporation relies on these\nexemptions. If some investors find the Common Shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the\nCommon Shares and the price of the Common Shares may be more volatile.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nClimate Change\nThe Corporation recognizes that climate change is as much an international concern as it is a community concern which may affect its\nbusiness and operations, directly or indirectly. The continuing rise in global average temperatures has created varying changes to\nregional climates across the globe, resulting in risks to equipment and personnel. Governments at all levels are moving towards\nenacting legislation to address climate change by regulating carbon emissions and energy efficiency, among other things. Where\nlegislation has already been enacted, regulation regarding emission levels and energy efficiency are becoming more stringent. The\nmining industry, as a significant emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, is particularly exposed to these regulations. Costs associated\nwith meeting these requirements may be subject to some offset by increased energy efficiency and technological innovation; however,\nthere is no assurance that compliance with such legislation will not have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and its share price.\nExtreme weather events (such as prolonged drought or freezing, increased flooding, increased periods of precipitation and increased\nfrequency and intensity of storms) have the potential to disrupt operations and transport routes. Extended disruptions could result in\ninterruption to production which may adversely affect the Corporation’s business, results of operations, financial condition and its\nshare price.\nClimate change is perceived as a threat to communities and governments globally. Stakeholders may increase demands for\nemissions reductions and call upon mining companies to better manage their consumption of climate-relevant resources\n(hydrocarbons, water etc.). This may attract social and reputational attention towards operations, which could have an adverse effect\non the Corporation’s business, results of operations, financial condition and its share price.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) and Public Health Crises\nThe Corporation may face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could significantly\ndisrupt its operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and financial conditions.\nAlthough the Corporation’s current operations are not being significantly impacted by COVID-19, the Corporation continues to monitor\nthe developments and impact of COVID-19 and any pandemic diseases as they may arise. The Corporation cannot estimate whether,\nor to what extent, any future outbreak of epidemics or pandemics or other health crises may have an impact on the business,\noperations and financial condition of the Corporation. The outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, may result in volatility and disruptions in the supply and demand for gold and other metals and minerals, global\nsupply chains and financial markets, as well as declining trade and market\n34\nsentiment and reduced mobility of people, all of which could affect commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings, credit risk, share\nprices and inflation. The risks to the Corporation of such public health crises also include risks to employee health and safety, a\nslowdown or temporary suspension of operations in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak, increased labor and fuel costs,\nregulatory changes, political or economic instabilities or civil unrest as well as the Corporation’s ability to service its debt obligations.\nAs such, the impacts of such crises may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition and the market price of the Common Shares. There can be no assurance that the Corporation’s personnel or its\ncontractors’ personnel will not be impacted by these pandemic diseases and ultimately see its workforce productivity reduced or incur\nincreased safety and medical costs / insurance premiums as a result of these health risks.\nPrecious and Base Metal Prices\nThe development of the Corporation’s properties is dependent on the future prices of minerals and metals. As well, should any of the\nCorporation’s properties eventually enter commercial production, the Corporation’s profitability will be significantly affected by\nchanges in the market prices of minerals and metals.\nThe price of precious and base metal prices can fluctuate widely and is affected by numerous factors including demand, inflation,\nstrength of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold sales by the central banks, forward sales by producers, global or\nregional political or financial events, and production and cost levels in major producing regions. In addition, prices are sometimes\nsubject to rapid short-term changes because of speculative activities. Even if the Corporation discovers commercial amounts of\nmetals on its properties, it may not be able to place the property into commercial production if precious and base metal prices are not\nat sufficient levels.\nCurrency Fluctuations\nThe Corporation is subject to currency risks. The Corporation's functional currency is the Canadian dollar, which is exposed to\nfluctuations against other currencies. The Corporation's activities are located in Canada, the United States and Mexico, and as such\nmany of its expenditures and obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos. The Corporation maintains its principal\noffice in Montreal, Québec, Canada, and maintains cash accounts in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos and has\nmonetary assets and liabilities in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos.\nThe Corporation's assets and liquidities are significantly affected by changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar and Canadian/Mexican peso\nexchange rates. Most expenses are currently denominated in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos. Exchange rate\nmovements can therefore have a significant impact on the Corporation's costs. The appreciation of non-Canadian dollar currencies\nagainst the Canadian dollar can increase the costs of the Corporation's activities.\nDIVIDENDS\nSince its incorporation, Osisko Development has not declared or paid any cash dividends on Common Shares. Any future dividend\npayment will depend on Osisko Development’s financial needs to fund its exploration programs and its future financial growth and any\nother factors that the Board deems necessary to consider in the circumstances. It is highly unlikely that any dividends will be paid in\nthe next financial year. Under the CBCA, the discretion of the Board to declare or pay a dividend on the Common Shares is restricted\nif reasonable grounds exist to conclude that the Corporation is, or after payment of the dividend would be, unable to pay its liabilities\nas they become due, or that the realizable value of its assets would, as a result of the dividend, be less than the aggregate sum of its\nliabilities and the stated capital of the Common Shares. See “Risk Factors”.\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nCommon Shares\nOsisko Development is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Common Shares without nominal or par value.\n35\nThe rights, privileges, conditions and restrictions attaching to the Common Shares, as a class, are equal in all respects, set out in the\nCorporation’s articles of continuance, by-laws, and in the CBCA and its regulations, and include the following rights.\nDividends\nThe holders of the Common Shares shall have the right to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board, any dividend on such dates\nand for such amounts as the Board may from time to time determine.\nParticipation in Case of Dissolution or Liquidation\nThe holders of the Common Shares shall have the right, upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Osisko Development, to\nreceive the remaining property of Osisko Development pro-rata among all holders of Common Shares.\nRight to Vote\nThe holders of the Common Shares shall have the right to one (1) vote per share at any meeting of the Shareholders of Osisko\nDevelopment.\nAs of March 31, 2023, 83,498,638 Common Shares were issued and outstanding.\nMARKET FOR SECURITIES\nTrading Price and Volume\nCommon Shares\nThe Common Shares are traded in Canada on the TSX-V, and in the U.S. on the NYSE.

As a result of the Consolidation that took\neffect on May 4, 2022 of three (3) pre-Consolidation Common Shares for one (1) post-Consolidation Common Share, each Listed\nWarrant entitles the holder to purchase one-third (1/3) of a post-Consolidation Common Share. Accordingly, a Listed Warrant holder\nwill be required to exercise three (3) whole Listed Warrants in order to purchase one whole post-Consolidation Common Share.\nThe Listed Warrants were issued pursuant to four warrant indentures dated (i) October 29, 2020, as supplemented on December 30,\n2020, between the Corporation, Osisko Development Holdings Inc. and the Warrant Agent; (ii) December 30, 2020 between the\nCorporation and the Warrant Agent; (iii) January 8, 2021 between the Corporation and the Warrant Agent; and (iv) February 5, 2021\nbetween the Corporation and the Warrant Agent. In connection with the listing of the Listed Warrants on the TSX-V, each of the\naforementioned warrant indentures were amended by a supplemental warrant indenture dated September 30, 2021 to merge all of\nthe outstanding Listed Warrants from the warrant indenture to the new warrant indenture with the effect of treating the outstanding\nListed Warrants as a single class for purposes of the listing of the Listed Warrants on the TSX-V and as a single mandate for the\nWarrant Agent.\n37\nPrior Sales - Securities Not Listed or Quoted on a Marketplace\nThe only securities of the Corporation that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 but not listed or quoted on a marketplace are\nthe Unlisted Warrants, the Options, the RSUs and the DSUs.\nThe price at which such securities have been issued by Osisko Development during the most recently completed financial year, the\nnumber of securities of the class issued at that price and the date on which such securities were issued are detailed hereinbelow.\nUnlisted Warrants\nThe following table sets forth the number of Unlisted Warrants issued during the most recently completed financial year, the date of\nthe issue and the exercise price thereof.\nNumber of\nUnlisted Warrants\nDate of Issue (Post-Consolidation Basis) Exercise Price Per Warrant\nMarch 2, 2022 3,175,283 $14.75(1)\nMay 27, 2022 11,363,933 US$10.70(2)\nMay 30, 2022 4,577,633 $14.75(1)\nMarch 2, 2023 7,841,850 $8.55\nNotes:\n(1) On the date of issue, these Warrants had an exercise price of $22.80 per Common Share, on a post-Consolidation basis.

Reference should be made to the full text of the\nCariboo Technical Report, which is available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under ODV’s issuer profile.\nThe Cariboo Technical Report is subject to certain assumptions, qualifications and procedures described therein.\nScientific or technical information in respect of the Cariboo Gold Project contained in this AIF was prepared by or under the\nsupervision of Maggie Layman, Vice President Exploration of the Corporation, who is a “qualified person” for purposes of NI 43-101.\nProperty Description and Ownership\nThe Cariboo Gold Project is located in ODV’s Cariboo Gold Project Main Block, a group of claims located in the historical Wells-\nBarkerville mining camp of British Columbia (“BC”) that extends for approximately 77 kilometres (“km”) from northwest to southeast.\nThe Cariboo Gold Project falls within the Cariboo Regional District, a division of the local government system in BC, and Wells, BC.\nWells is situated 74 km east of Quesnel, approximately 115 km southeast of Prince George, and approximately 500 km north of\nVancouver.\nODV’s land holdings consist of 415 mineral titles totalling 155,088.69 hectares (“ha”) across two contiguous property blocks known as\nthe Cariboo Main Block and the Quesnel River Mill (“QR Mill”) site. These mineral titles include mineral claims, mineral leases, placer\nclaims, and placer leases.\nThrough its 100% owned subsidiary Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd. (“BGM”), ODV holds 100% interest in 56 Cariboo Main Block placer\ntitles, 35 QR Mill Property mineral claims, the QR Mill mineral lease No. 320752, and 362 of the 379 Cariboo Main Block mineral and\nplacer claims and placer leases. 17 mineral claims are jointly owned with other companies and individuals: ODV holds a 97.5%\ninterest in six mineral claims, an 85% interest in two mineral claims, and a 50% interest in the other nine mineral claims.\n58\nA map showing mineral title distribution and ownership is presented below:\nMineral Title and Ownership Map for the Cariboo Gold Project\nThe Cariboo Gold Project also contains 546 private land parcels from Crown-granted mineral claims (3,330.20 ha) that overlap many\nof the mineral titles where BGM is the registered owner on the title of the surface and/or undersurface rights to the parcels. A net\nsmelter return (“NSR”) royalty of 5% payable to Osisko Gold Royalties is the only royalty that applies to the Cariboo Gold Project.\nFor a summary of permitting and regulatory approvals required on the Cariboo Gold Project, please refer to the section\n“Environmental and Permitting” below.\n59\nAccessibility, Climate and Infrastructure\nThe Cariboo Gold Project is located in Wells, BC, approximately 74 km east of the City of Quesnel. The Cariboo Gold Project is\naccessible via Highway 26, which branches off Provincial Highway 97 at Quesnel. A network of gravel roads provides access to Cow,\nIsland, and Barkerville Mountains. The Cariboo Gold Project offices and related facilities are located in the town of Wells. The QR Mill\nis a wholly-owned and fully permitted milling and tailings facility approximately 110 km from Wells. An all season forest service road\nprovides access (500 Nyland Lake Road).\nThe City of Quesnel is the primary supply and service centre for natural resource industries and has the closest regional hospital.\nManpower is also available in the region. The Cariboo Gold Project has sufficient power and water to support a mining operation.\nCanadian National Railway provides rail access from Quesnel to the Port of Vancouver.\nODV has sufficient surface rights in the Cariboo Gold Project area for mineral exploration and development operations. These rights\nare generally conveyed by ODV’s Crown-granted mineral claims or by specific permits, such as those related to tailings and waste\ndisposal areas, or water and timber use, and the mineral lease currently being applied for.\nODV holds seven water licences: one (1) for Willow River, three (3) at the QR Mill, one (1) at the Ballarat temporary work camp, one\n(1) unused licence on Island Mountain, and one (1) for a well at the geological compound and field offices at Lowhee Creek. The\nclimate allows for year-round mining operations, and there is enough readily available water to conduct diamond drilling.\nThe Cariboo Region experiences a dry continental climate due to the coastal mountains influencing the westerly flow of winds and\nmoisture coming from the Pacific Ocean. The climate at the site is characterized by relatively cold winters and mild summers. The\nannual precipitation is moderate and there is comparatively little variation over the year in monthly precipitation. The Cariboo Gold\nProject is able to operate 365 days a year.\nHistory\nThe Cariboo Gold Project contains several historical mines, including Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine, Aurum Mine/Island Mountain Mine,\nand Mosquito Creek Mine.\nAll “reserves” and “resources” estimates provided in this section are historical in nature and should not be relied upon. The qualified\nperson has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. It is unlikely\nthey comply with current NI 43-101 requirements or follow Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”) Definitional\nStandards, and their relevance and reliability have not been verified. They are included in this section for illustrative purposes only\nand ODV and BGM are not treating the historical estimate as current mineral reserves. For the purposes of this section, the term “ore”\nis being used in a historical context.\nHistorical Mines\nCariboo Gold Quartz Mine\nFred Wells purchased the Rainbow claim group from A.W. Sanders and formed Cariboo Gold Quartz Mining Company Ltd. (“Cariboo\nGold Quartz Mining”) in 1927. The Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine operated from 1927 to 1959 at Cow Mountain.\nIn 1959, in its 33rd annual report, the company reported book reserves of 95,265 tonnes of mineralized material, including a 1952\nreserve write-down of 42,275 tonnes of 9.26 grams per tonne (“g/t”) gold (“Au”) and another 52,990 tonnes of 12.69 g/t Au scattered\nin 51 mineralized material remnants through 13 levels and across a distance of 10,500 ft (3,200 metres (“m”)).\nThe Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine continued operating using feed from the Aurum Mine until March 1967. During the period between\n1933 and 1967, a total of 1,951,944 tonnes of mineralized material were mined, yielding 863,307 oz of gold and 91,652 oz of silver\n(MINFILE number 093H 019). The average recovery during that period was 95.3%.\n60\nIsland Mountain Mine (Aurum Mine)\nIn 1925, C.J. Seymour Baker acquired the original five Crown-granted mineral claims (later known as the Aurum Group) (the “Aurum\nGroup”), at which he worked until 1932. In 1932, Newmont Mining Corporation (“Newmont”) acquired the Aurum Group and eight\nadjacent claims to form Island Mountain Mines Company Ltd.\nUnder Newmont’s ownership, production from the mine was 699,536 tonnes from which 333,705 oz of gold and 48,130 oz of silver\nwere recovered (MINFILE number 093H 006). The mill also recovered 531 lbs of zinc and 134 lbs of lead.\nCariboo Gold Quartz Mining purchased the mine and equipment from Newmont in 1954 for a sum of $305,000. Underground\nworkings extending northwest from the Island Mountain Mine into the Mosquito Group are formally known as the Aurum Mine.\nMosquito Creek Mine\nAndrew H. Jukes, of Calgary, acquired the Mosquito Creek claim group and formed Mosquito Creek Gold Mining Company Ltd.\n(“Mosquito Creek Gold”) in 1971 to explore the ground above the Aurum Mine. Surface exploration drilling and underground\ndevelopment from 1971 to 1975 were financed by a joint venture agreement with the Home Oil Company Ltd. of Calgary (the “Home\nOil Company”). They conducted an extensive surface and underground exploration and development program on the property. In\n1975, Mosquito Creek Gold purchased all of Home Oil Company’s interest in the property. Subsequently, Peregrine Petroleum Ltd.\n(“Peregrine”) entered into a joint venture agreement with Mosquito Creek Gold, whereby it ultimately earned a 50% working interest\nin the property.\nA total of 27,384 oz of gold were recovered from 86,248 tonnes of mostly pyrite-type mineralized material milled during the main\nproduction period (1980 to 1983). The operation failed due to low initial reserves and a low discovery rate of new mineralized\nmaterial. The latter was the result of insufficient development at depth and northwest of the Mosquito Fault.\nIn 1984, Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd. (“Hudson Bay”) optioned the property but dropped it after earning a 10% interest.\nHudson Bay sold its interest back to Mosquito Creek Gold and Peregrine sold its 50% interest to Mosquito Creek Gold.\nIn 1986, the property was optioned by Hecla Mining Company of Canada Ltd. who conducted underground exploration work and then\ndropped their interest in the company.\nMining operations were intermittent until 1987 when Mosquito Creek Gold became Mosquito Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd\n(“Mosquito Consolidated Gold”). After the gold price dropped, and new ore became hard to find, the mine closed in 1987. During\nthe period between 1980 and 1987, a total of 92,826 tonnes of ore were mined from which 35,054 oz of gold and 9,750 oz of silver\nwere recovered (MINFILE number 093H 010).\nIn 1988, Lyon Lake Mines Ltd optioned the property and earned a 50% interest after performing underground exploration.\nSurface Work Programs\nCariboo Gold Quartz Mining Company Ltd (1968)\nIn 1968, Dolmage Campbell and Associates Ltd carried out 5 km of bulldozer trenching on behalf of Cariboo Gold Quartz Mining. A\ntotal of 17 trenches approximately 2 m to 2.5 m deep were excavated across the Baker-Rainbow contact over a strike length of 1.6\nkm on Island Mountain. Pyritic mineralization, 6 m long by 1 m wide, was discovered in Trench J.\nWharf Resources Ltd (1980-1981)\nIn 1972, Cariboo Gold Quartz Mining amalgamated with Coseka Resources Ltd (“Coseka Resources”) to form a company with the\nname of the latter. In April 1973, Wharf Resources Ltd (formerly Plateau Metals and Industries) amalgamated with French Exploration\nLtd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coseka Resources) (“Wharf Resources”). Wharf Resources carried out surface drilling programs\nin 1980 and 1981 to search for near-surface ore on the Cariboo and Island Mountain claim groups. A total of 7,010 m of percussion\ndrilling and 1,219 m of diamond drilling were completed in 1980 and 1981.\n61\nBlackberry Gold Resources Inc. (1988)\nIn 1987, Blackberry Gold Resources Inc. completed several work programs on the ARCH 1-4 claim group located on Cow and\nRichfield mountains. The objective of the work was to discover gold mineralization associated with the system of north-striking fault\nstructures. Very low frequency electromagnetic geophysical surveys were used to define conductors inferred to be the strike\nextension of major faults on the Cariboo Group of Crown-granted mineral claims. Four strong conductive trends were tested along six\nfences of percussion drill holes for a total of 2,424 m of drilled in 79 holes. This was followed by 2,465 m of diamond drilling in 19\nholes.\nPan Orvana Resources Inc. (1989-1991)\nOn July 12, 1985, Mosquito Creek Gold purchased the Cariboo and Island Mountain claim groups from Wharf Resources, Pan\nOrvana Resources Ltd (“Pan Orvana”) signed the Cariboo Gold Option Agreement on May 20, 1988, obtaining the right to earn a\n50% interest in the Cariboo Group, but terminated the agreement in 1991 without exercising the option. Pan Orvana excavated 20\nsurface trenches, drilled four holes and conducted ground geophysical surveys, geochemical sampling programs and geological\nmapping.\nGold City Mining Corp. (1994-1995)\nIn 1994 and 1995, Gold City Mining Corp. (“Gold City Mining”) assembled a large land position consisting of 13,000 ha of mineral\ntitles between Mount Tom and the Cariboo Hudson Mine to form the Welbar Gold Project.\nDoing so involved seven option agreements, including one that covered the Mosquito Creek, Island Mountain and Cariboo claim\ngroups. The latter was subject to the Cariboo Option Agreement between Mosquito Consolidated Gold and International Wayside\nGold Mines Ltd. (“IWGM”). Intera Information Technologies Corp. flew a synthetic aperture radar survey in July 1995. DIGHEM I\nPower completed a regional airborne radiometric- Mag-EM survey of 1,280 line-kilometres, as well as trenching and diamond drilling\non some of their properties, including one drill hole on the Mosquito Creek Group.\nFrom October 1 to November 30, 1995, Gold City Mining conducted a 13-hole (1,865 metres) diamond drilling program on the\nCariboo-Hudson Property. Gold City Mining optioned the Cariboo-Hudson Property from Cathedral Gold Corp. in 1994. In November\n1995, Gold City Mining sunk four diamond drill holes (560 metres) on the Williams Creek Property. That same month, Gold City\nMining drilled two holes (390 metres) on the Island Mountain Property.\nInternational Wayside Gold Mines Ltd\n1999-2014\nFrom 1999 to 2014, IWGM drilled 66 holes totaling 8,602 m in surface diamond drilling on the Island Mountain Project.\n1995-2009\n1995-1999 Work Programs\nIWGM worked the Cariboo Gold Project area continuously from May 1, 1995. Most of the work was carried out on the main mine\ntrend, either from the surface or underground from the 1,200-level adit. In 1998 and 1999, a secondary target, the BC Vein, was\nexplored over a strike length of 384 m by 31 surface drill holes totaling 2,245.2 m. Between 1995 and 1999, IWGM’s drilled 104 holes\ntotaling 7,349.4 m in surface diamond drilling, 17 holes totaling 654.1 m in underground diamond drilling and 135 holes totaling\n5,739.9 m in underground percussion drilling over the Rainbow, Pinkerton, Sanders, Butts and BC Vein zones.\nIn the summer of 1997, IWGM carried out a geochemical and prospecting program to find new mineralized showings and generate\ntargets for further exploration. The geochemical surveys yielded 1,079 soil samples, 59 stream sediment samples and 121 rock\nsamples.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, IWGM drilled a total of 104 surface diamond drill holes (7,349.4 metres), 17 underground diamond drill holes\n(654.1 metres) and 135 underground percussion drill holes (5,739.9 metres).\n62\n2000-2009 Work Programs\nIWGM carried out extensive work from 2000 to 2009. During this period, IWGM drilled 336 holes totaling 49,121.5 m in surface\ndiamond drilling and 76 holes totaling 6,177.4 m in underground diamond drilling over the Bonanza Ledge zone.\nBarkerville Gold Mines Ltd.\n2010-2014\nFrom 2010 to 2014, BGM engaged in surface diamond drilling on the Cariboo Gold Project and drilled a total of 318 holes (73,700.1\nm).\n2015-2022\nBGM as it operated from 2015-2022, will be referred to as ODV. Current ODV management has been in place since 2015 and on\nNovember 21, 2019, Osisko Gold Royalties acquired the Cariboo Gold Project through the acquisition of BGM. The Cariboo Gold\nProject was part of the Contributed Osisko Assets that created ODV on November 25, 2020.\nDuring 2015, ODV milled 11,275 tonnes of Bonanza Ledge ore at an average head grade of 10.14 g/t Au, a recovery rate of 94%, and\nan average net operating cost of $877/oz. Based on the results as of February 28, 2015, management decided to cease production\nand place Bonanza Ledge under care and maintenance.\nIn 2016, ODV mandated InnovExplo Inc. (“InnovExplo”) to complete a NI 43-101 technical report and Mineral Resources Estimate\n(the “2017 MRE”) for the Barkerville Mountain deposit. GEOVIA GEMS was used for modelling purposes and the estimation\napproach, which consisted of 3D block modelling and the ordinary kriging interpolation method. The close-out date of the database\nwas July 18, 2016, and the effective date of the 2017 MRE was March 21, 2017.\nIn January 2017, ODV began commissioning its wholly-owned QR Mill using the low-grade stockpile at the Bonanza Ledge open pit.\nMaterial sorting was done at the stockpile, producing relatively high-grade pre-concentrate. By the end of February 2017, ODV had\ntransported 2,860 tonnes of ore to the QR Mill for an average grade of 2.94 g/t Au. During the second quarter of 2017, ODV began\nportal and underground development at the Bonanza Ledge Mine to prepare for the processing of in-situ Bonanza Ledge material. A\ntotal of 470 m of underground development was completed in 2017, resulting in the processing of approximately 7,000 tonnes of both\nlow-and higher-grade development material at the QR Mill for commissioning and training purposes.\nIn 2017, ODV mandated InnovExplo to update the 2017 MRE and perform a review and validation of the maiden mineral resource\nestimate for the Cow Mountain and Island Mountain deposits combined. The close-out date of the database was December 31, 2017,\nand the effective date for the 2018 mineral resource estimate was May 2, 2018 (the “2018 MRE”). Test Mining at Bonanza Ledge was\ncompleted in December 2018. The objective was to gain technical information and train personnel to aid in future studies, permitting,\nand future mining. A total of 1,900 m of development took place at the Bonanza Ledge Mine in 2018. Approximately 120,000 tonnes\nof ore was extracted and processed at an average grade of 5.94 g/t Au. Bonanza Ledge Mine was placed on care and maintenance\nin December 2018.\nIn 2019, ODV mandated InnovExplo to review, validate and update the 2018 MRE. Based on the mineral resource estimate\ncompleted in 2019, ODV mandated BBA Engineering Ltd. to prepare a technical report and preliminary economic assessment for the\nCariboo Gold Project (the “Cariboo 2019 PEA”). The effective date of the Cariboo 2019 PEA was August 18, 2019. The Cariboo 2019\nPEA provided a base case assessment for developing the Cariboo Gold Project as a 4,000 tpd underground mine, with a\nconcentrator located at the Mine Site at Wells and further processing at the QR Mill. The mine life was estimated to be 11 years.\nIn 2020, ODV mandated InnovExplo to complete an NI 43-101 technical report to present an updated mineral resource estimate and\ngeological model (the “2020 MRE”) for the Cariboo Gold Project. In 2022, a PEA was completed for the Cariboo Gold Project (the\n“2022 PEA”). The effective date of the 2022 mineral resource update was May 17, 2022.\nThe Bonanza Ledge Mine resumed development in mid–2019 and in 2020, 3,268 tonnes of ore was extracted at an average grade of\n2.58 g/t Au. In 2020, the underground focus was the development of drifts to access the BC Vein. In 2021, 98,786\n63\ntonnes of ore was extracted at an average grade of 4.48 g/t Au (as of December 31, 2021). In 2022, 170,652 tonnes of ore was\nextracted at an average grade of 5.16 g/t Au. Development of a new portal to access and develop a bulk sample at the Cow Mountain\nportion of the mineral resource was completed in December 2021. The Bonanza Ledge Mine was placed on care and maintenance\nagain in June 2022.\nGeology and Mineralization\nThe Cariboo Gold Project lies within the Kootenay Terrane of the Omineca Tectonic Belt in the south-central Canadian Cordillera. The\nOmineca rocks were complexly deformed by Middle Jurassic to Early Tertiary compressional tectonics, and by Tertiary transtension\nand extension. The Kootenay Terrane in the vicinity of the Cariboo Gold Project is subdivided into the eastern Cariboo and western\nBarkerville subterranes. The Cariboo Subterrane is juxtaposed on the Barkerville Subterrane by the east-dipping Pleasant Valley\nThrust.\nThe Snowshoe Group, central to the Barkerville Subterrane, hosts the Cariboo Gold Project. The Barkerville and Cariboo Subterranes\ncomprise metamorphosed equivalents of continent-derived siliciclastic protoliths with interlayered marble units and granitic\northogneiss. The subterranes are pericratonic in character and are thought to have formed near the current western margin of\nLaurentia. Various authors suggest that both Barkerville and Cariboo Subterranes share the same tectostratigraphic position and\ndepositional environment.\nThe principal gold-producing areas in the Barkerville Subterrane are hosted in rocks metamorphosed to lower-greenschist facies\n(sub-biotite isograd); amphibolite-facies rocks are locally found on the Cariboo Gold Project but are not associated with any significant\nmineralization. The S1 and S2 fabrics are defined by phyllosilicate minerals (sericite and chlorite); they generally define foliation\nsuggesting that peak metamorphic temperature coincided with the formation of cleavage.\nLode-gold mineralization in the Wells-Barkerville mining camp (Cariboo Gold District) shares many characteristics with an orogenic\ngold deposit model. Gold mineralization is associated with orogenic silica-carbonate-sericite-pyrite stable fluids moving along\nsecondary permeability controlled by metamorphic fabrics, vein arrays, faults, lithologic contacts, and rheological contrasts. Deposit\ntypes on the Cariboo Gold Project consist of vein and replacement-type mineralization grouped into five inter-related styles:\n1. Fault-fill breccia veins subparallel to foliation (S1), hosted in carbonaceous mudstone;\n2. Vertical northeast-trending extensional veins dominantly hosted in sandstone units in S3 cleavages;\n3. Fractured moderately dipping east-northeast-trending shear veins, hosted in sandstone units;\n4. Gold bearing sulphide replacements hosted in fold hinges of calcareous sandstone units; and\n5. Gold-bearing sulphide replacement mineralization hosted in fault-bounded calcareous siltstone units.\nDeposit Types\nThe Cariboo Gold Project shares many characteristics with an orogenic gold deposit model. This class of deposit is typified by\ndeformed and metamorphosed mid-crustal blocks and major structures, inherent products of orogenesis. Orogenic gold deposits span\nthe entire breadth of the province of British Columbia, occurring predominantly within two main belts. The westerly belt is associated\nwith accreted pericratonic terranes linked to Late Cretaceous to Paleocene movement on crustal-scale dextral strike-slip fault systems\nalong the western margin of the Stikine terrane, and eastern Coast Belt. The easterly belt is crudely cospatial with the Jurassic to\nCretaceous accretion of the Intermontane terranes and autochthonous strata of the ancestral North American. Orogenic deposits\nhave significant economic importance, as they are known to host auriferous mineralization as high-grade vein deposits, low-grade\nbulk-tonnage lode deposits, and are intimately linked with substantial placer accumulations.\nMost orogenic gold deposits in metamorphic terranes, such as the Barkerville terrane, are found adjacent to first-order, deep-crustal\nfault zones, which show complex structural histories and may extend along strike for hundreds of kilometres with widths of as much\nas a few thousand metres. Most orogenic gold deposits occur in greenschist facies rocks, but significant orebodies can be present in\nboth lower and higher-grade rocks. Hydrothermal fluids are generated from\n64\nmetamorphic dehydration reactions along deepcrustal fault zones, driven by episodes of major pressure fluctuations during seismic\nevents. Gold mineralization is associated with orogenic silica-carbonate-sericite-pyrite stable fluids moving along secondary\npermeability controlled by metamorphic fabrics, vein arrays, faults, lithologic contacts, and rheological contrasts. Gold deposits form\nas simple to complex networks of gold-bearing, laminated quartz-carbonate shear veins along second and third-order faults,\nparticularly at jogs or changes in strike along major deformation zones.\nMineralization styles vary from stockworks and breccias in shallow, brittle regimes, through laminated crack-seal veins and sigmoidal\nvein arrays in brittle-ductile crustal regions, to replacement- and disseminated-type orebodies in deeper, ductile environments.\nMineralization is syn- to late-deformation and typically post-peak metamorphism, and commonly associated with silica-carbonate-\nsericite-pyrite alteration. Gold is largely confined to the quartz-carbonate vein network, but may also be present in significant amounts\nwithin iron-rich sulphidized wall-rock selvages, or within silicified and sulphide-rich replacement zones. One of the key structural\nfactors for gold mineralization emplacement is often a late strike-slip movement event that reactivates earlier-formed structures within\nthe developing orogen.\nInter-related vein systems are the principal source of gold and silver within the Barkerville trend and are a key fluid pathway for\nsulphide mineralization. Axial planar (“AXPL”) quartz veins represent the dominant vein system hosting gold-and-silver-rich sulphide\nmineralization for the Mosquito Creek, Shaft, Valley, Cow Mountain, Lowhee, and KL zone deposits.\nVeins range in width from millimetres to several metres and are termed vein corridors when highly concentrated over 2 m in width and\nup to hectometres in strike. Vein corridors are planar structures, typified as steeply dipping, striking N020-N050, 100 m–700 m\ndowndip and extending 100 m–300 m along strike. The principal aims of exploration and infill drilling programs involve testing the\nextent and concentrations of AXPL vein corridor deposits, with targeting based in part on proximity to identifiable large-scale F3 hinge\nzones.\nReplacement-style gold mineralization contains the most consistently high gold grades in the Cariboo Gold Project and were the main\ntarget for the historic underground Mosquito Creek Mine on Island Mountain. Semi-massive replacement style mineralization\nobserved at the historically mined Bonanza Ledge is fault-bounded in the footwall of the BC Vein shear. The replacement deposits\nobserved at Island Mountain and Mosquito Creek are thought to be structurally controlled in the hinges of F2 folds and the formation\nof L-tectonites and considered contemporaneous with the AXPL veining.\nSteep, orogen-parallel, D2-parallel faults, and damage zones act as fluid pathways for crustal fluids. The BC Vein is a poly-deformed,\nsteeply-dipping, and S1 strike-parallel shear zone of unknown relative offset. The structure is internally characterized by strongly\ncarbonaceous to graphitic siltstone fault breccia, discontinuous pods of brecciated milky white quartz and later stage grey quartz\nwhich has, in places, annealed the breccia matrix. Fine-grained pyrite and gold are associated with the annealing late-stage grey\nquartz. The Wells Shear is interpreted as the offset Cow Mountain equivalent of BC Vein owing to its similar strike, deformational\nstyle, and position within tectonostratigraphic sequence. The BC Vein-Wells Shear structure is highly variable in thickness both along\nstrike and down dip. The close geographic association between this structure and the locations of highest density axial planar veining\nas well as the highest gold grades in both soil and rock geochemical assays is taken to reflect its importance as a fluid pathway at the\ntime of mineralization.\nExploration\nODV’s exploration team executed a systematic methodology to the exploration program on the Cariboo Gold Project. The program\nincluded geological mapping, channel, soil, underground sampling, and diamond drilling.\nThe exploration team has continued its geological mapping across the Cariboo Gold Project’s area to identify lithologic contacts,\ndefine alterations and geochemical signatures, record micro- and macro-scale structural data, and to collect select rock samples. The\ntargeted deposit types within the Cariboo Gold Project are structurally and/or geochemically controlled, thus the mapping data\ncontinues to play a vital role in refining the geologic model of the area and defining mineralized zones.\n2015-2019 Geochemical and Mapping Programs\nFrom 2015 to 2019, ODV executed a systematic approach with surface mapping and geochemical sampling. From 2015 to 2017,\nsampling efforts specifically targeted the Barkerville Trend, a major deep-seated shear that trends 60 km northwest-southeast through\nthe centre of the Cariboo Gold Project area, called the Cariboo Break at the time. In 2018 and 2019, the\n65\nfocus shifted to the northwest and southeast extensions of known mineralization around the Wells area within the Barkerville Trend.\nFurther exploration was conducted along the parallel Lightning Creek Trend.\n2016 Magnetic and VTEM Survey Program\nIn 2016, a helicopter-borne Magnetic and VTEM Survey was conducted by Geotech Ltd. over ODV’s Cariboo Gold Project. The\nsurvey was flown in southwest to northeast lines spaced 200 m apart. A total of 7,024 line-km of data was acquired. The data was\ncorrected against a base station. The program resulted in 1,308 km2 of geophysical data that confirmed a northwest-southeast\nanomaly associated with magnetic anomalies.\n2020 Geochemical and Mapping Programs\nGeological surface mapping took place on the Burns Mountain prospect from June 22 to August 4, 2020. Geochemical surveying\ncoincided with mapping on the Yanks Peak prospect from August 18 to September 10, 2020. The geochemical survey then moved to\nBurns Mountain from September 10 to 29, 2020. The objective at Yanks Peak prospect was designed to expand upon the results\nderived from the 2017 and 2018 geochemical survey completed by ODV. The grid at the Burns Mountain prospect was designed to\ninfill a gap in the geochemical grid and expand to the south of Lightning Creek to Chisholm Creek.\nThe 2020 geochemical sampling program was designed to primarily test for soil geochemical signatures in an area known to host\nseveral mineral occurrences which lay within a quartzite dominant lithology. A secondary objective was to collect stratigraphic and\nstructural geologic information with emphasis on structural control and the structural relation to mineralization on the properties. A\ntotal of 429 soil samples and seven (7) rock samples were collected on the Burns Mountain prospect; 1,187 soil samples and 56 rock\nsamples were collected on the Yanks Peak prospect in 2020.\nThe principal aims of the 2020 mapping program were to refine the understanding of local stratigraphy and structure, with emphasis\non the structural controls on mineralization. Additionally, another goal of the program was to delineate highly prospective target areas\nfor future brownfields exploration and provide recommendations for targeting methodology. The program consisted of detailed\ngeologic mapping at a 1:2000 scale at the Burns Mountain, Yanks Peak and Cunningham Creek prospects. A total of 43 rock samples\nwere collected at the Burns Mountain prospect, 12 rock samples at the Cunningham Creek prospect and 42 rock samples at the\nYanks Peak prospect. The 2020 program collected an additional 3,060 structural measurement at 905-point locations on the Burns\nMountain prospect, 1,036 structural measurements at 341-point locations on the Cunningham Creek prospect, and 2,318 structural\nmeasurements at 706-point locations on Yanks Peak prospect. The anomalous gold-in-soil values along with the data gleaned from\nthe geologic mapping program on these prospects indicated stratigraphy and veining similar to those which are gold-bearing in the\nWells-Barkerville area.\n2021 Geochemical and Mapping Programs\nGeological surface mapping took place on the Burns Mountain prospect from June 1 to July 25, 2021, and September 18 to October\n3, 2021, and on the Cunningham Creek prospect from August 12 to October 21, 2021. The geochemical survey took place on the\nBurns Mountain, Cow Mountain, and Mount Agnes prospects from June 26 to July 21, 2021 and July 25 to August 31, 2021.\nThe primary objective of the 2021 Soil program was to connect the Burns Mountain and Yanks Peak soil sampling grids along the\nLightning Creek Trend. A secondary objective was to begin closing the gap in the soil data between Cow Mountain and Burns\nProspects, following up on anomalies seen in the eastern portion of Burns Mountain and western portion of Cow Mountain. In total,\n651 soil samples were collected on the Burns Mountain prospect, 682 on the Mount Agnes prospect and 20 on the Cow Mountain\nprospect areas. In addition, a total of eight (8) rock samples were collected on the Mount Agnes prospect and eight on the Burns\nMountain prospect by the geochemical sampling team in 2021. The 2021 Geologic mapping programs principal aims were to\ndelineate and provide detailed exploration strategies for greenfield-brownfield exploration targets within both Burns Mountain and\nCunningham Creek prospects. The focus of the mapping efforts in the Burns Mountain area was on Mount Nelson and Oregon Gulch.\nThe efforts on Mount Nelson were in following up on geochemical anomalies found in previous years’ soil programs. Oregon Gulch\nhas many historic showings that suggest mineralization in a style comparable to what ODV is targeting. On the Cunningham Creek\nprospect mapping was focused on the historic Cariboo-Hudson Mine and along the trend of it. Detailed geologic mapping was\nconducted at a 1:2000 scale. A total of 244\n66\nrock samples were collected on Burns Mountain, eight (8) rock samples on Mount Agnes, and 97 rock samples on the Cunningham\nCreek prospects. The 2021 mapping team collected an additional 3,509 structural measurements at 844-point locations on the Burns\nMountain prospect, and 1,390 structural measurements at 407-point locations on the Cunningham Creek prospect. The anomalous\ngold-in-soil values along with the data collected from the geologic mapping program on both prospects indicated stratigraphy and\nveining similar to those which are gold-bearing in the Wells-Barkerville area.\nDrilling\nFrom 2015 to 2022, BGM/ODV drilled a total of 2,280 diamond drill holes, totalling 695.08 km of drill core. While surface data\ncontinues to inform the geologic model, diamond drill core is the primary source of geological information for the Cariboo Gold\nProject.\nThe objectives for the 2020 and 2021 diamond drilling programs (the “2020 Program” and the “2021 Program”) were to test new\nbrownfields targets adjacent to known deposits, infill high-grade vein corridors modelled from the Cariboo 2019 PEA classified as\nInferred and explore the depth potential of known deposits. The focus of the 2022 diamond drilling program (the “2022 Program”)\nwas the infill of a proposed underground bulk-sampling area, the continued category conversion from Inferred to Indicated status of\nmodelled vein corridors, and the delineation of additional vein corridors. The 2022 Program started on March 25, 2022, and was\ncompleted on July 6, 2022.\nDrilling Methodology\nDrills are aligned using a Suunto compass. Drill alignments are confirmed using Minnovare’s Azimuth Aligner (it was used for a part of\nthe 2021 drilling campaign and all of the 2022 drilling campaign). The downhole dip and azimuth are surveyed using a REFLEX EZ-\nTRAC too. Collar locations are determined using a Trimble DGPS. The first survey was usually measured 9 m below the casing, and\nreadings were then taken every 30 m downhole. A survey was also taken at the bottom of the hole if the end of hole (“EOH”) depth\nwas 15 m or more from the previous test. The instrument was handled by the drilling contractors, and survey information was digitally\nrecorded using IMDEX’s IMDEXHUB-IQ, as well as transcribed and provided in paper format to ODV geologists.\nAt the drill rig, the drill helpers placed core into core boxes and marked off every 3 m drill run using a labeled wooden block. The drill\nhelpers were also responsible for marking orientation information on the core using either the REFLEX ACT IIITM tool or the Devico\nDeviHead orientation tool. All holes were drilled in NQ diameter unless noted otherwise in the Cariboo Technical Report.\nAll drill hole casings collared at an elevation similar to Jack of Clubs Lake were cemented into bedrock. Special consideration was\ngiven to the Valley Zone due to the local groundwater conditions, whereby a cementing procedure was deployed to ensure no\ngroundwater would escape the drill hole once plugged: A first hole was drilled through the overburden and cased (HWT size) 6 m to 9\nm into competent bedrock. HQ drill rods were then drilled 1 m beyond casing. Once the geologist and drill foreman inspected the rock\nto ensure the rock was competent bedrock, casing was reamed to the bottom of the hole and cemented with the drill foreman present.\nA PQ displacement plug was then pushed downhole until cement came up around the casing, leaving it to set. After at least 24 hours,\n250 pounds per square inch (“psi”) of water pressure was applied to the drill hole. If, during the pressure test, the pressure decreased\nand water was able to escape the cement, the drill hole was either abandoned or recemented. If no issues were experienced during\nthe pressure test, drilling would then commence, and this process was repeated for any additional holes. Upon completion of the drill\nhole, a safety plug was placed 24 m past the shoe and the hole cemented. The HQ drill rods were then removed, and a displacement\nplug was pumped down the hole. One additional batch of cement was then pumped downhole, and a wait time of 45 minutes was\nobserved, ensuring that no water was seen exiting the hole.\nCore Logging Procedures\nThe drill core was transported to ODV’s facility in the District of Wells, British Columbia where it was cleaned of drilling additives and\nmud, and the metres were marked before collecting the data. Recovery for each 3 m drill run was noted. When recovery was less\nthan 2.5 m (>0.5 m of loss), loss was recorded on a separate block as a “lost core interval”.\nGeotechnical data collection included Rock Quality Designation (“RQD”), Intact Rock Strength (“IRS”), and fracture counts at 1–3 m\nintervals. Magnetic susceptibility data were not collected because it was concluded that such data are not relevant\n67\nto the deposit. Downhole orientation lines were connected where possible, and orientation off-set measurements were recorded. All\ndata (lithology, alteration, mineralization, structures, interval structures, and veins less and greater than 5 centimetres “cm”) were\nrecorded using Datamine DHLogger software. Sample intervals and pertinent information regarding lithology, mineralization and\nalteration were marked on the core.\nAfter recording the sampling information, drill core samples were cut in half using a diamondblade table mounted rock saw. Half the\nsample was bagged and labelled, then packaged for shipment to an assay lab. Numbered security tags were applied to lab shipments\nfor chain of custody requirements. Samples were then shipped to the laboratory of ALS Minerals (“ALS”) in North Vancouver, BC, for\nanalysis. The remaining half-core samples are stored on-site in a secured location for future reference.\nThe qualified persons (“QP”) have not identified drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and\nreliability of the results. In the opinion of the QPs, the core logging and sampling procedures used by ODV are consistent with\ngenerally accepted industry best practices and are, therefore, adequate for an advanced exploration project.\n2015 to 2019 Drilling\nIn 2015, drilling was focused on Barkerville Mountain with 180 holes drilled on the BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge deposit, totalling\n35,848.5 m; eight (8) drill holes on the KL Zone totalling 1,675 m, and 12 dill holes on the Barkerville Mountain deposit totalling\n3,626.7 m. The 2015 diamond drill program was designed to drill the BC Vein structure at a spacing of 25 m to 50 m to a depth of 250\nm from surface, and a spacing of 100 m down to a depth of 450 m below surface.\nIn 2016, drilling on Barkerville Mountain consisted of 53 holes on the BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge deposit, totalling 8,605.5 m, and\n10 holes on the KL Zone deposit, totalling 2,621.18 m. The BC Vein area was drilled to infill high-grade areas at 12.5 m to 25 m\nspacing while the KL Zone was drilled to test an 800 m-long gold-in-soil (“Au-in-soil”) anomaly. Cow Mountain drilling produced 233\ndrill holes on the Cow prospect, and drill holes on the Valley Zone prospect, totalling 31,157.07 m and 1,023.5 m, respectively. The\n2016 campaign tested depths of approximately 300 m. Drill holes were completed on approximately 50 m centres in selected areas.\nDrilling in the Valley Zone tested the lateral extents of AP veins and refined the stratigraphic model. Results showed denser than\nexpected vein occurrences. As a result, three more rigs were added to the program and collar locations were stepped out to expand\nthe intersected vein corridors. On Island Mountain, 33 holes were drilled on the Shaft Zone prospect, and 50 holes on the Mosquito\nCreek prospect, totalling 11,289.5 m and 16,026.75 m, respectively. Drilling on Island Mountain was conducted in order to understand\nthe structural and lithological controls on gold mineralization, as well as to test the down-plunge extent of sulphide replacement\nzones.\nIn 2017, drilling was again conducted on Barkerville Mountain (BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge, KL Zone, and Barkerville Mountain\ndeposits), Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley Zone deposits), and Island Mountain (Shaft Zone and Mosquito Creek deposits).\nBarkerville Mountain drilling produced 25 holes at BC Vein, seven at Bonanza Ledge, and one (1) drill hole at KL Zone, totalling\n4,412.7 m, 3,388 m, and 530.15 m, respectively. The 2017 drilling program on Barkerville Mountain explored the Au-in-soil anomaly\nadjacent to the KL Zone, investigating the 2016 identified targets. Cow Mountain had a total of 17 drill holes at the Cow prospect, and\n80 drill holes at the Valley Zone prospect, totalling 6,034.7 m, and 38,872.96 m, respectively. Cow Mountain drilling continued the\ngoals of the 2016 drilling program. Island Mountain had a total of 211 holes at the Shaft Zone prospect, and 44 dill holes at the\nMosquito Creek prospect, totalling 93,733.12 m and 13,455.7 m, respectively.\n68\nIn 2018, drilling was conducted on Barkerville Mountain (BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge deposits), Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley\nZone deposits), and Island Mountain (Shaft Zone and Mosquito Creek deposits). Barkerville Mountain had a total of ten (10) drill holes\non the BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge deposits totalling 1,683.8 m. The aim of the 2018 Program at Barkerville Mountain was to provide\ninfill data on the BC Vein. In addition, the program expanded upon data collected in 2017 and also targeted vein mineralization\nconcentrated within the hanging wall of the BC Vein. Cow Mountain had a total of 246 drill holes on the Cow prospect, and two (2) drill\nholes on the Valley Zone prospect, totalling 67,715.05 m and 401.9 m, respectively. The aim of the 2018 Program at Cow Mountain\nwas to infill and expand the high-grade gold-bearing vein corridors. Drilling on Island Mountain produced 168 drill holes on the Shaft\nZone prospect, and 20 drill holes on the Mosquito Creek prospect, totalling 53,731.29 m and 4,597 m, respectively. The 2018\nProgram at Island Mountain focused on targets generated by underground mapping and sampling data, as well as historical data\ncompiled from smaller scale mapping, trenching, soil sampling and drilling programs. The program aimed to demonstrate continuity\nand expand on known mineralized vein corridors. Infill drilling was designed to intercept modelled vein corridors with a 25 m spacing\nat depth in order to convert Inferred resources to the Indicated category.\nIn 2019, drilling was conducted on Barkerville Mountain (BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge, KL Zone, Williams Creek, and Lowhee Zone\ndeposits), Cow Mountain (Cow prospect), and Island Mountain (Shaft Zone, Mosquito Creek, and Willow prospects) (the “2019\nProgram”). Barkerville Mountain had a total of 36 drill holes on the BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge deposit, 73 on the KL Zone, four (4)\non Williams Creek, and 24 holes on the Lowhee zone, totalling 7,974.2 m, 31,974.62 m, 1,572 m, and 8,422 m, respectively. The\n2019 Program on Barkerville Mountain focused on exploration for mineralized vein corridors analogous to those on Cow Mountain\nand Island Mountain within the prospective sandstone unit, with drilling on BC Vein to increase confidence in the block model. Cow\nMountain had a total of 72 drill holes on the Cow prospect, totalling 16,136.6 m and was primarily focused on infill drilling and testing\ndown dip extents of mineralized vein corridors. Island Mountain had a total of 26 drill holes on the Shaft Zone prospect, 15 on the\nMosquito Creek prospect, and six on the Willow prospect, totalling 12,032.45 m, 8,258.89 m, and 3,078.9 m, respectively. The\nobjective of the 2019 Program on Island Mountain was to infill high-grade areas currently classified as Inferred on the Mosquito and\nShaft Zones and to test the strike and depth extent of the mineralized vein corridors. Exploration to the northwest of Mosquito Creek\nalso occurred on what is known as the Willow Target, an Au-in-soil geochemical anomaly identified from 2018 soil sampling.\nAdditionally, the Proserpine property had a total of six (6) holes drilled, totalling 2,676.25 m. This program was aimed at testing Au-in-\nsoil anomalies and historical gold occurrences, as well as historical underground workings.\n2020 Drilling Program\nThe 2020 Program was conducted between January 16, 2020, and December 14, 2020, by Smithers, B.C. based Hy-Tech Drilling\nLtd. (“Hy-Tech”) and its primary focus was delineating the Cow-Island-Barkerville corridor. A total of 57,078.8 m was drilled in 201\nsurface holes. The objective of this program was to delineate mineralized vein corridors further within all deposits and intercept veins\nwith a 25 m spacing from previously drilled holes in order to convert Inferred resources to the Indicated category. The below table\nprovides a summary of BGM’s 2020 Program:\nNumber of\nDeposit Drill Holes Metres Drilled\nBC Vein and Bonanza Ledge 3 560.60\nLowhee Zone 24 10,144.50\nCow Mountain 48 12,596.05\nValley Zone 56 17,558.85\nShaft Zone 15 3,909.00\nMosquito Creek 50 9,392.40\nProserpine 5 2,917.40\nTotal 201 57,078.80\nOverall, visual inspection of the 2020 drilling results demonstrated that the thickness and the grade of the mineralized zones were in\nthe same order of magnitude as the 2020 MRE. The 2020 drilling continued to confirm the geological and grade continuities that were\ndemonstrated in the 2020 MRE.\n69\n2021 Drilling Program\nThe 2021 Program was conducted by Hy-Tech between January 4, 2021 and October 20, 2021. The 2021 Program also saw the\naddition of Paycore Drilling, based in Valemount, British Columbia, between August 18, 2021, and October 16, 2021.\nThe 2021 Program at Island Mountain focused on Shaft Zone with 60,990.8 m drilled in 162 holes, and Mosquito Creek totalling\n10,710.65 m drilled in 42 holes, further continuing the category conversion work from Inferred to Indicated status within known vein\ncorridors.\nThe 2021 Program at Cow Mountain was primarily focused in the Valley Zone to continue category conversion work and expand\nknown mineralized vein corridors with a total of 47,484.92 m drilled in 108 holes. Minor drilling on Cow Mountain was conducted,\ntotalling 1,988.5 m drilled in six (6) holes. The purpose of this drilling was to conduct metallurgical testing of modelled vein corridors.\nThe 2021 Program at Lowhee Zone continued to define the prospect, targeting mineralized vein corridors within the prospective\nsandstone unit analogous to those on Cow Mountain and Island Mountain. A total of 29,860.9 m was drilled in 95 holes. Drill hole\nspacing along the modelled vein corridors was kept to a distance of 25 m.\n2022 Drilling Program\nThe 2022 Program was conducted by Hy-Tech at the Lowhee Zone on Barkerville Mountain. The 2022 Program started on March 25,\n2022, and was completed on of July 6, 2022. The focus of the 2022 Program at the Lowhee Zone was the infill of a proposed\nunderground bulk sampling area, the continued category conversion from Inferred to Indicated status of modelled vein corridors, and\nthe delineation of additional vein corridors.\nAssay results from 27 drill holes were received after April 6, 2022, representing 6,563.9 m of assays, and, as such, are excluded from\nthe 2022 FS MRE (as defined herein). Overall, the visual inspection of the 2022 drilling results demonstrated that the thickness and\nthe grade of the mineralized zones are in the same order of magnitude as the 2022 FS MRE. The 2022 drilling continues to confirm\nthe geological and grade continuities that were demonstrated in the 2022 FS MRE.\nSample Preparation, Analyses and Security\nThe following paragraphs describe the sample preparation, analysis and security procedures of the 2020 and 2021 Programs\nincluded in the current resource estimate in the Cariboo Technical Report. The QPs reviewed the quality assurance-quality control\n(“QA/QC”) procedures and results completed only on gold assay results.\nCore Handling, Sampling and Security\nCore handling, sampling, and security procedures as detailed in this section are managed by ODV personnel.\nThe drill core is placed into wooden core boxes at the drill site with the end of each drill run marked with a small wooden block\ndisplaying the depth of the hole. Box labels indicate the hole and box numbers. The boxes are racked and covered at the drill,\nsecured with ratchet straps, and then transported daily from the drill site to ODV’s core storage and logging facility in the District of\nWells, British Columbia. The boxes are labelled in permanent marker with the hole and box number (e.g., GR-15-01 Bx 1). The core is\ntransported by truck during the drilling programs. There are two secure core storage areas, one in Wells near the core logging facility\nand a second is located near the Ballarat Camp, approximately 5 km east of Wells.\nUpon receiving a load of core from the drill crew, the core is brought into the logging room. Meterage blocks are checked for errors,\nthe core is oriented in the box and cleaned, and the metre marks are drawn on the core before logging begins. The geological and\ngeotechnical core logging data is collected with Datamine’s DHLogger software.\n70\nThe sample intervals are between 0.5 m and 1.5 m in length and do not cross geological contacts. A line is drawn with a pencil along\nthe length of the core to indicate where the core will be sawed. Each sampling ticket is divided into three tags. One tag is stapled to\nthe core box at the beginning of the interval to record the drill hole number and sample interval recorded. The second tag is placed in\nthe sample bag, which is sent to the laboratory; this tag does not reference the drill hole or meterage. The last tag remains in the\nsample ticket book with the hole number and recorded intervals. All samples are assigned a unique sample number.\nAfter the core boxes with tags are photographed, the core boxes are moved to the cutting station. The core is cut lengthwise by\ndiamond saw, with half the core submitted as the primary sample and the remaining half core retained in the core box for future\nreference.\nThe samples are individually bagged with the corresponding tag. The tag number is written on the bag and each bag is sealed. The\nbags are then placed in rice bags and the rice bags are sealed with numbered security tags for the chain of custody requirements. If\nany tampering with security tags is suspected, the laboratory will communicate with ODV. Samples are transported to the ALS\nlaboratory in Vancouver, BC and the remaining drill core is subsequently stored on site at ODV’s secure facilities in Wells and at a\nsecond location near the Ballarat Camp.\nSample Preparation and Assay\nSample Preparation\n● Samples are sorted and logged into the ALS LIMS program;\n● Samples are dried and weighed;\n● Samples are crushed to +70% passing 2 millimetres (“mm”) (CRU-31);\n● The crushed sample split of up to 500 grams (“g”) is pulverized to +85% passing 75 microns (“μm”) screen (PUL 32m);\n● Samples containing visible gold or cosalite mineralization are assayed by metallic screen method; a crushed sample split of\n1,000 g is pulverized (method PUL-32) to pass 100 μm (Tyler 150 mesh) stainless steel screen to separate the oversize\nfractions (method SCR-21).\nGold Assaying\n● A 50 g pulp aliquot is analyzed by Au-AA26: fire assay followed by aqua regia digestion (HNO3-HCl) with an atomic\nabsorption spectroscopy finish (“AAS”);\n● When assay results are higher than 100 g/t Au, a second 50 g pulp aliquot is analyzed by Au-GRA22: fire assay (“FA”),\nparting with nitric acid (HNO3) with a gravimetric finish;\n● All samples containing visible gold or cosalite mineralization are assayed by the metallic screen method (method Au-SCR21).\nAt the request of ODV, any sample exceeding 100 g/t Au (Au-AA26) is rerun with the screen method following the procedure\nbelow;\n● For visible gold assays or cosalite mineralization, the +100 μm fraction (Au+) is analyzed in its entirety by fire assay with\ngravimetric finish. The 100 μm fraction (minus) is homogenized and two subsamples are analyzed by FA with AAS (Au-AA25)\nor gravimetric finish (AuGRA21). The average of the two minus fraction subsamples are taken and reported as the Au-\nfraction result. The gold content is then determined by the weighted average of the Au+ and Au- fractions.\nMulti-Element Assaying\n● Some samples are analyzed by trace-level multi-element method ME-MS61: a 0.25 g aliquot is digested by four-acid\ndigestion (HNO3-HClO4-HF-HCl) and HCl leach (method GEO-4A01) and analyzed by ICP-AES;\n71\n● Following this analysis, the results are reviewed for high concentrations of bismuth, mercury, molybdenum, silver, and\ntungsten and diluted accordingly. Samples meeting these criteria are then analyzed by ICP-MS. Results are corrected for\nspectral interelement interferences.\nSpecific Gravity Measurements\n● Before crushing and pulverizing, the specific gravity of selected samples is determined by the bulk sample method (water\ndisplacement, OA GRA08).\nQuality Assurance and Quality Control\nA total of 49,243 and 111,361 samples (including QA/QC samples) were assayed during 2020 and 2021, respectively. The 2020 and\n2021 QA/QC programs included a routine insertion of standards and blanks to monitor gold assay results. ODV included one\nstandard in every 20 samples and one blank in every 40 samples. The 2020 and 2021 QA/QC programs did not include field or\ncoarse reject duplicates.\nAccuracy is monitored by adding standards at the rate of one certified reference materials (“CRM”) for every 20 samples. Standards\nare used to detect assay problems with specific sample batches and any possible long-term biases in the overall dataset. ODV’s\ndefinition of a quality control failure is when:\n● Assays for a CRM are outside plus or minus three standard deviations (±3SD) or ±10%; or\n● Assays for two consecutive CRMs are outside ±2SD, if one of them is outside ±3SD.\nConclusions\nA total of 564 holes from the 2020 and 2021 Programs were included in the current resource. The QP is of the opinion that the\nsample preparation, analysis, QA/QC, and security protocols used for the Cariboo Gold Project follow generally accepted industry\nstandards, and that the data is valid. The QP recommends the implementation of QA/QC on the silver assay results for future\nprograms.\nData Verification\nThe QPs verified the ODV diamond drill hole databases used for the 2022 MRE (the “ODV Databases”) and reviewed and validated\ngeological models of each deposit, and reviewed information on mined-out areas and the data for selected drill holes (assays, QA/QC\nprogram, downhole surveys, lithologies, alteration, and structures). The QP also reviewed and validated the resource estimation\nprocess followed by Daniel Downton, P.Geo., of ODV, including all parameters, geological interpretation, basic statistics, variography,\ninterpolation parameters, block model construction, scripts that run the model, volumetric report, and the validation process.\nThe ODV Databases contain the 4,064 completed and validated diamond drills holes used for the 2022 FS MRE for the Cariboo Gold\nProject. They are divided among four databases covering the eight (8) deposits as follows:\n● Cow Mountain database for the Cow and Valley deposits (1,473 holes);\n● Island Mountain database for the Shaft and Mosquito deposits (1,851 holes);\n● Barkerville Mountain database for the BC Vein and Splays, the KL, and the Lowhee deposits (578 holes);\n● Bonanza Ledge database (162 holes).\nSince the 2020 MRE, no drilling has been carried out on the KL, BC Vein, and the Bonanza Ledge deposits. The block model\ncompleted for the 2020 MRE for the Bonanza Ledge deposit as published in the 2020 technical report remains current for the 2022\nFS MRE. The block model completed for the BC Vein deposit for the 2022 Mineral Resource Estimate dated May 17, 2022 (the “2022\nPEA MRE”) remains current for the 2022 FS MRE. Other block models for the remaining six (6) deposits were updated.\n72\nA site visit was conducted from November 1 to 5, 2021 by the QP, Vincent Nadeau-Benoit. The site visit included a visit and review of\nthe core logging facilities, drill pads, and mineralized outcrops. The QP also examined core samples from drill holes from the 2020\nProgram and 2021 Program. Core logging and sampling procedures were discussed with ODV’s geologists. Discussions covered\ncollar locations, drilling protocols, downhole surveys, logging protocols, oriented core, structural measurements, sampling protocols\nand QA/QC protocols. Nadeau-Benoit, QP, is of the opinion that the site visit and validation exercises demonstrated the validity of the\nprotocols in place and their use during the 2020 Program and 2021 Program.\nCarl Pelletier, QP, also previously conducted site visits; from February 1 to 4, 2016, and from May 3 to 12, 2016. The first included the\nBonanza Ledge pit, the Cow Mountain area, and the Island Mountain area. The second involved a visit to the core logging facilities\nand several drill hole collars.\nMineral Resource Estimate\nThe 2022 Feasibility Mineral Resource Estimate for the Cariboo Gold Project (the “2022 FS MRE”) encompasses updated resources\nfor the deposits of Cow Mountain (Cow Zone and Valley Zone), Island Mountain (Shaft Zone and Mosquito Zone), and Barkerville\nMountain (Lowhee Zone and KL Zone). The updates were prepared by Daniel Downton, P.Geo., of ODV, and reviewed and validated\nby Carl Pelletier, P.Geo., and Vincent Nadeau-Benoit, P.Geo., both of InnovExplo, using all available information. Since the 2022 PEA\nMRE, no new gold assay results were added to the databases for the Mosquito, Cow, and KL Zone deposits, but gold resources in a\ndilution halo and silver mineralization estimates in the vein corridors were added to the models. No changes are reported for the\nBonanza Ledge or BC Vein (Barkerville Mountain) deposits. To report the 2022 FS MRE for the Cariboo Gold Project, conceptual\n“potential mining shapes” were used as constraints to demonstrate mineralized continuity and to show that the “reasonable prospects\nfor eventual economic extraction” criteria is met, as defined in the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves and\nthe CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines. The Mineral Resource updates for Shaft,\nValley, and Lowhee Zones include new information from the end of the 2021 exploration program. The dilution halos and silver\nestimate additions contain data from all previous drilling campaigns, including previously validated historic information.\nThe 2022 FS MRE covers all the deposits in the Cow-Island-Barkerville Mountain Corridor. The resource area for the Cow\nMountain/Island Mountain segment covers a strike length of 3.7 km and a width of approximately 700 m, down to a vertical depth of\n600 m below surface. The estimate for the Barkerville Mountain segment covers a strike length of 3 km and a width of approximately\n700 m, down to a vertical depth of 500 m below surface.\nTwo diamond drill hole databases cover the Cariboo Gold Project: Bonanza Ledge and BM-CM-IM (Barkerville Mountain including the\nBC Vein, KL, and Lowhee deposits, Cow Mountain including the Cow and Valley deposits, and Island Mountain including the Shaft\nand Mosquito deposits). These databases were filtered by deposit (Cow, Shaft, Valley, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, or Lowhee) before the\nwork in Datamine. A subset of drill holes was used to generate the 2022 FS MRE database for each deposit, as follows:\n● The Cow deposit contains 1,219 validated drill holes;\n● The Valley deposit contains 254 validated drill holes;\n● The Shaft deposit contains 1,010 validated drill holes;\n● The Mosquito deposit contains 641 validated drill holes;\n● The Lowhee deposit contains 113 validated drill holes;\n● The BC Vein and KL Zone deposits contain 420 validated drill holes.\nThe QP data verification included the ODV Databases used for the 2022 FS MRE, as well as the review and validation of the\ngeological models of each deposit, the review of information on mined-out areas, and the data for selected drill holes (assays, QA/QC\nprogram, downhole surveys, lithologies, alteration and structures).\n73\nThe QPs also reviewed and validated the resource estimation process followed by ODV, including all parameters, geological\ninterpretation, basic statistics, variography, interpolation parameters, block model construction, scripts that run the model, volumetric\nreport, and the validation process.\nHistorical work subject to verification consisted of the holes used for the 2022 PEA MRE. Basic cross-check routines were performed\nbetween the current ODV Databases and the previously validated database for the 2022 PEA MRE.\nThe QPs were granted access to the assay certificates for all holes in the 2021 drilling programs. Assays were verified for 5% of the\ndrill holes. No discrepancies were found.\nOverall, the QPs data verification demonstrates that the data, protocols, and estimation process for the Cariboo Gold Project are\nacceptable. The QPs consider the ODV databases to be valid and of sufficient quality to be used for the Mineral Resource Estimate\nherein.\nODV updated, in 2022, the geological models for the Valley, Shaft, and Lowhee deposits using historical data, the data from the\n2015–2019 drilling programs, and new holes from the 2020–2021 drilling programs. The KL and BC Vein deposit were not drilled in\n2021 and the Mosquito and Cow deposits had no new data since the May 17, 2022 update, though the geological models were\nreviewed by the QPs. The Bonanza Ledge geological model, initially from Brousseau et al. (2017), was reviewed and validated by the\nQPs.\nA total of 482 geological solids were created and/or updated for all the deposits.\nThe QPs have classified the 2022 FS MRE as Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources based on data density, search\nellipse criteria, drill hole density, and interpolation parameters. The 2022 FS MRE is considered to be reliable and established on\nquality data and geological knowledge. The Mineral Resource Estimate follows the 2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral\nResources and Reserves.\n74\nTable 1 displays the results from the 2022 FS MRE, exclusive of the reserves, for the Cariboo Gold Project for all eight (8) deposits:\nCow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, KL, Lowhee, BC Vein, and Bonanza Ledge.\nTable 1: Cariboo Gold Project 2022 FS MRE Reported at a 2.0 g/t Au Cut-Off Grade\n(Except for Bonanza Ledge Reported at a 3.5 g/t Au Cut-Off Grade)\nTonne Au Grade Au Ounce Ag Grade Ag Ounce\nCategory Deposit ‘000 (Au g/t) ‘000 (Ag g/t) ‘000\nMeasured Bonanza Ledge 47 5.06 8\nBonanza Ledge 32 4.02 4\nBC Vein 1,030 3.12 103\nKL 386 3.18 39\nLowhee 1,368 3.18 140 0.23 10\nIndicated Mosquito 1,288 3.68 152 0.08 3\nShaft 4,781 3.39 523 0.06 9\nValley 2,104 3.14 213 0.09 6\nCow 3,644 3.31 388 0.09 11\nTotal Indicated Mineral Resources 14,635 3.32 1,564 0.09 39\nBC Vein 461 3.55 53\nKL 1,918 2.75 169\nLowhee 445 3.34 48 0.10 1\nInferred Mosquito 1,290 3.55 147 0.01 0\nShaft 6,468 3.84 800 0.01 1\nValley 2,119 3.30 225 0.02 1\nCow 2,769 3.03 270 0.00 0\nTotal Measured and Indicated\nMineral Resources 14,682 3.33 1,571 0.09 39\nTotal Inferred Mineral Resources 15,470 3.44 1,712 0.01 4\nMineral Resource Estimate notes:\n(1) The independent and qualified persons for the Mineral Resource Estimates, as defined by NI 43-101, are Carl Pelletier, P.Geo.,\nand Vincent Nadeau Benoit, P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.). The effective date of the 2022 FS MRE is November 11, 2022.\n(2) These Mineral Resources, exclusive of the reserves, are not Mineral Reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic\nviability.\n(3) The Mineral Resource Estimate follows the 2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves and the 2019\nCIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines.\n(4) A total of 481 vein zones were modelled for the Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley), Island Mountain (Shaft and Mosquito),\nBarkerville Mountain (BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee) deposits and one gold zone for Bonanza Ledge. A minimum true thickness of\n2.0 m was applied, using the gold grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed.\n(5) The estimate is reported for a potential underground scenario at a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au, except for Bonanza Ledge at a cut-\noff grade of 3.5 g/t Au. The cut-off grade for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee deposits was calculated\nusing a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD: CAD exchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $54.32/t; a processing and\ntransport cost of $22.29/t; a G&A plus Environmental cost of $15.31/t; and a sustaining CapEx cost of $31.19/t. The cut-off grade\nfor the Bonanza Ledge deposit was calculated using a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27; a global\nmining cost of $79.13/t; a processing and transport cost of\n75\n$65.00/t; and a G&A plus Environmental cost of $51.65/t. The cut-off grades should be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing\nmarket conditions (metal prices, exchange rate, mining cost, etc.).\n(6) Density values for Cow, Shaft, Lowhee, and BC Vein were estimated using the ID2 interpolation method, with a value applied for\nthe non-estimated blocks of 2.80 g/cm3 for Cow, 2.78 g/cm3 for Shaft, 2.74 g/cm3 for Lowhee, and 2.69 g/cm3 for BC Vein.\nMedian densities were applied for Valley (2.81 g/cm3), Mosquito (2.79 g/cm3), and KL (2.81 g/cm3). A density of 3.20 g/cm3 was\napplied for Bonanza Ledge.\n(7) A four-step capping procedure was applied to composited data for Cow (3.0 m), Valley (1.5 m), Shaft (2.0 m), Mosquito (2.5 m),\nBC Vein (2.0 m), KL (1.75 m), and Lowhee (1.5 m). Restricted search ellipsoids ranged from 7 g/t Au to 50 g/t Au at four different\ndistances ranging from 25 m to 250 m for each deposit. High-grades at Bonanza Ledge were capped at 70 g/t Au on 2.0 m\ncomposited data.\n(8) The gold Mineral Resources for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee vein zones were estimated using\nDatamine StudioTM RM 1.9 software, using hard boundaries on composited assays. The silver Mineral Resources and the\ndilution halo gold mineralization were estimated using Datamine StudioTM RM Pro 1.11. The Ordinary Kriging (“OK”) method was\nused to interpolate a sub-blocked model (parent block size = 5 m x 5 m x 5 m). Mineral Resources for Bonanza Ledge were\nestimated using GEOVIA GEMSTM 6.7 software using hard boundaries on composited assays. The OK method was used to\ninterpolate a block model (block size = 2 m x 2 m x 5 m).\n(9) Results are presented in situ. Ounce (troy) = metric tons x grade / 31.10348. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes, g/t,\netc.). The number of tonnes was rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.\nRounding followed the recommendations as per NI 43-101.\n(10)The qualified persons responsible for the MRE section of the Cariboo Technical Report are not aware of any environmental,\npermitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the\nMineral Resource Estimate.\nMineral Reserve Estimate\nMineral Reserves were classified in compliance with the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. As\nsuch, the Mineral Reserves are based on Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources and do not include any Inferred Mineral\nResources. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are exclusive of proven and probable reserves. Mineral Reserves are the\nestimated tonnage and grade of ore that is considered economically viable for extraction. Mineral Reserves for the Cariboo Project\ndeposit incorporate dilution and mining recovery factors based on the selected mining method and design. In addition, economic\nanalyses were completed to validate the profitability of particular areas of the reserves. The following sources of information were\ninstrumental in the Mineral Reserve estimation process: the resource blocks model (last updated September 8, 2022); the 2022 PEA\nMRE; the current 3D model of existing underground workings and historical stope outlines; the litho-structural model of the site.\n76\nThe different cut-off grade calculations are based on parameters from benchmarks derived from the previous 2022 PEA MRE, as well\nas ODV and InnovExplo estimates. Due to the variation in metallurgical recoveries along the deposit, four (4) cut-off grades were\nused for the stope optimization. The parameters used in these calculations are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 2: Cut-Off Grade Calculation Parameters\nPhase 1 (1,500 tpd) Phase 2 (4,900 tpd)\nGeneral Marginal General Marginal\nEconomic blocks at Economic blocks at\nInput Parameters Assessment vicinity Assessment vicinity\nGold Price $US/oz 1,700 1,700 1,700 1,700\nExchange Rate $CAD/$US 1.27 1.27 1.27 1.27\nRoyalty % 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00%\nRefining Cost $/oz 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0\nProcessing Cost and transport $/t treated 66.34 66.34 22.29 22.29\nMetallurgical Recovery % 92.30% 92.30% 92.10% 92.10%\nMining Recovery % 94.00% 94.00% 94.00% 94.00%\nMining Dilution % 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00%\nMining Cost $/t treated 71.90 71.90 54.32 54.32\nSustaining Cost $/t treated 50.00 0.00 31.19 0.00\nEnvironment $/t treated 14.45 14.45 4.93 4.93\nGeneral and Administration $/t treated 17.35 17.35 10.38 10.38\nCut-Off Grade g/t 4.00 3.10 2.30 1.70\nTable 3: Cariboo Gold Statement of Mineral Reserves as of December 6, 2022\nTonnage Grade Contained Gold Grade Contained Silver\nCategory (t) Au (g/t) (oz) Ag (g/t) (oz)\nProven\n- — — — — —\nProbable\nCow 4,126,955 3.41 452,941 0.08 11,018\nValley 3,444,914 3.70 409,887 0.14 15,059\nShaft 7,962,448 3.87 989,757 0.02 4,473\nMosquito 602,591 4.93 95,479 0.03 619\nLowhee 566,547 4.56 83,088 0.21 3,786\nTotal P & P 16,703,454 3.78 2,031,152 0.07 34,955\nNotes:\n(1) The Qualified Person for the Mineral Reserve Estimate is Eric Lecomte, P.Eng.

The external dilution is estimated to be\n8%. The average mining recovery factor was set at 93.6% to account for mineralized material left in each block in the margins of\nthe deposit.\n77\nMining Methods\nThe Cariboo Gold Project consists of three (3) main zones (Cow, Shaft, and Valley) with two (2) smaller satellite zones (Lowhee and\nMosquito). The rate of exploitation of each deposit will change over time, while the overall steady state production rate is 4,900 tpd. In\n2024, production will begin at 1,500 tpd (pending permitting) for 2.75 years and will ramp up to 4,900 tpd (pending permitting) in 2027\nfor 8.5 years.\nThe selected mining method is mainly long hole longitudinal retreat with some stopes using a modified long hole longitudinal retreat\nmethod. Primary materials handling fleet will comprise of 10 tonne Load Haul Dump (“LHD”) and 50 t haul trucks.\nPre-production of the underground workings is set to begin in 2023 with 1,500 tpd achieved in September 2024 and full production of\n4,900 tpd at the Mine Site Complex (“MSC”) in Q4 2027. Underground mine life is set to last until January 2036.\nA hydrogeological investigation program was completed to provide key groundwater related inputs to the FS, namely, to estimate\npotential mine dewatering rates, to understand further the regional groundwater flow regime, and to characterize potential impacts of\nmine dewatering on groundwater and surface water systems.\nGeotechnical Evaluation\nSRK undertook two geotechnical field investigation programs on the Cariboo Gold Project designed to characterize the rock\ngeotechnical conditions and support the underground mine and infrastructure designs. These investigations also supported structural\ngeology reviews, detailed evaluation of geotechnical design domains, and the development of geotechnical design guidelines within\neach of these domains. These guidelines included excavation design parameters, estimates of dilution, as well as support\nrequirements.\nThe 2018 geotechnical field data acquisition program included drilling and logging of 13 dedicated geotechnical drill holes. The 2021\ngeotechnical field data acquisition program included drilling and logging of five (5) dedicated geotechnical drill holes. During both\nprograms, representative rock core samples from each geotechnical domain were collected from the geotechnical drill holes for\nlaboratory testing.\nA review of photographs taken of exploration drill holes was undertaken from 2020 to 2022 to build a broader geotechnical\nunderstanding of the rock mass conditions across the Cariboo Gold Project site to optimize the geotechnical design. A total of 83,047\nm of photo-logging has been conducted to date.\nIn addition to the 3D structural model created by ODV to represent the major Regional Fault structures on the Cariboo Gold Project\nproperty, SRK also provided a 3D fault model that was created for the secondary structures.\nThe geotechnical evaluation focused on a qualitative drill-hole-based assessment of the rock mass forming the immediate hanging\nwall and footwall of the proposed mineable stopes in each vein. Planned stopes in each major vein corridor, in each mining zone were\nindividually assessed based on the lithology logging data provided by ODV, the regional structural model provided by ODV, the\nsecondary structural model provided by SRK, the current understanding of existing historic mine workings, the geotechnical data\nacquired from the field program, and qualitative photographic review of drill holes intercepting the planned stopes.\nExcavation stability assessments have been completed using well-established empirical and semi-empirical relationships and\nengineering experience. The design procedure involves two steps: the quality of the rock mass is rated using a pre-defined\nclassification system, and then the expected performance of the underground openings is predicted using an empirically derived\nstability correlation with the rock mass quality.\nSub-level open stoping with a sub-level spacing of 30 m is achievable in rock mass Class 1 to Class 3 lower by varying the open\nstrike length and the use of two-phase backfill in the Class 3 lower rock mass in the Shaft Zone where stope widths are less than 5 m.\n78\nMining Method Description\nThe long hole mining method was primarily selected due to the sub vertical geometry of mineralized vein corridors and the relatively\nlower cost. This method involves driving two drifts longitudinally along the mineralized vein corridors to define a stope. The top access\nserves as a drilling platform while the bottom access allows for mucking of drilled then blasted material. Once empty, these stopes are\nthen backfilled with either paste fill or cemented rockfill. Stopes are mined retreating towards the access. This method allows for\nsimultaneous mining of stopes along different vein corridors as well as along the same corridor if a pillar exists between active levels.\nA modified longitudinal method will also be used to a lesser extent (10% of the tonnage). That method essentially follows the same\napproach as the first one, except that the mucking and backfilling are done in two steps to limit the size of the exposed walls. This\nmethod will only be used for stopes located in poor ground during Phase 2, since paste backfill is required.\nThe minimum designed stope width for all zones is 3.7 m and the sill to sill stope height for all zones is 30 m. The maximum\npermissible strike length (the distance along strike that can be mined before backfilling is required) is a function of geotechnical\nconstraints and differs by zone.\nMine Design\nThere will be two (2) portals accessing underground ramps. The Cow Portal will allow access to the Lowhee, Shaft, and Mosquito\nzones in the earlier stages of the Cariboo Gold Project. The Valley portal will be built during the expansion to develop the Main ramp\nconnecting the previous zones to the new Cow and Valley Zones. The Valley Portal will be used as the main services access. The\nzones are accessed by main ramps connecting to haulage drifts, and each individual zone has an internal ramp system. The\nMosquito Zone is further west, connected to Shaft Zone by a 1,150 m long haulage drift.\nEach zone is planned to be mined with the longitudinal retreat long hole method, except for the Shaft Zone and Mosquito Zone that\nwill be mined using both mining methods. Sublevels for all zones are 30 m sill to sill and a combination of Cemented Rock Fill and\npaste fill are planned to backfill mined stopes. Stope strike lengths vary by zone based on geotechnical assessments of each zone.\nAll zones are capped by a crown pillar (15 m for Cow and Valley and 20 m for Shaft and Mosquito) and vary in depth.\nUnderground Infrastructure\nA major piece of underground infrastructure for the Phase 2 of the Cariboo Gold Project is the underground crushing system. This\ncrusher is located below the services building in a location that has been identified as geotechnically favourable for long-term\ninfrastructure. Ore will be brought to the crusher by underground trucks from all mining zones.\nOre will ultimately be brought to surface using a vertical conveyor to be pre-concentrated by sorting and flotation. The material\nrejected by the sorter will be transferred back underground using a wastepass raise and then it will either be used as backfill material\nor hauled to the Bonanza Ledge Waste Rock Storage Facility (“WRSF”) using automated trucks.\nThe mine will include haulage drifts connecting the five (5) separate zones, an underground garage, and pumping stations. The Valley\nPortal will provide access for material and the labour force.\nDevelopment Schedule\nThe development schedule has been created with a combination of traditional jumbo development and roadheaders. The\nroadheaders are scheduled to provide a lateral advance of 200 m per month in single heading conditions and will be concentrated on\nthe ramps and level access development. The jumbos will provide an average overall lateral advance of 300 m per month per jumbo\ncrew when multiple active headings are available. Lateral development will rely on contractors for the initial pre-production phase,\nwith a handover to mine personnel with the initiation of production.\nElectrical Distribution and Networks\nDuring Phase 1, electrical power will be delivered to the mine through the Cow Portal from a 13.8 kilovolt (“kV”) overhead power line\noriginating from Bonanza Ledge Site. At Phase 2, power will be delivered from the main electrical room at the\n79\nMSC to Valley Portal, while the power connection at Cow Portal will remain as a redundant power connection. Underground\nsubstations will transform the power to 600 volt (“V”) or 1,000 V depending on need or equipment to be supplied.\nFiber optics will be used to provide a data backbone to the mine. The mine network will then rely on 4G provided by radiant cables.\nThis will allow for communication, automation of equipment, as well as ventilation-on-demand.\nMine Automation and Monitoring Systems\nThe layout of mine levels was designed to facilitate the automation of mucking and hauling. Each level will have one load out, which\nwill allow for tele-remote loading of haulage trucks or loading of dumped waste material. Automation, or tele-operation of haulage\ntrucks will be limited to dedicated drift or between shifts only. Automation and tele-remote for LHD will be available any time as\nproduction levels will be isolated with barricades. By the end of 2027, all mucking operation on the production levels will be fully\nautomated, with one operator for two LHD’s.\nPermanent Mine Pumping Network\nThe mine dewatering network was designed to handle 10,666 cubic metres per day (“m3/day”). This system will also contribute to the\ndewatering of historic excavations.\nVentilation\nThe ventilation system has been designed to comply with British Columbia regulations. The airflow required to ventilate diesel\nengines was compiled using a 0.06 cubic metres per second (“m3/s”)/ kilowatt (“kW”) rate.\nThe system will be comprised of four (4) independent intake fresh air raises, one exhaust raise and remaining exhaust through the\nmain ramps and the Cow Portal. The total estimated airflow required to meet production is 715,000 cubic feet per minute (“cfm”) (337\nm3/s).\nProduction Rate\nBeginning in 2024, the total production rate will be 1,500 tpd (Phase 1), ramping up in 2027 to 4,900 tpd (Phase 2) (ore), with each\nzone contributing a different ratio to production over time.\nProduction Plan\nThe life of mine plan (“LOM”) has a 12-year mine life at maximum production rates from 1,500 tpd to 4,900 tpd. Production ramps-up\nto steady state of 4,900 tpd is achievable by the end of 2027, the third production year, with completion of the flotation circuit. The\noverall mine plan comprises 16.7 million tonnes (“Mt”) of ore that will be processed with an average grade of 3.8 g/t Au. The mine will\nproduce 7.1 Mt of waste from the development over the LOM.\n80\nTable 4: Ore Produced Per Year\nYear 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029\nLowhee t 4,823 178,373 382,498 854 — — —\ng/t 4.37 4.68 4.51 5.19 — — —\nCow t — — — — — 87,289 315,430\ng/t — — — — — 3.55 4.05\nValley Upper t — — — 4,615 8,503 163,792 164\ng/t — — — 3.09 4.00 3.16 1.70\nValley Lower t — — — — — 200 170,592\ng/t — — — — — 4.36 4.11\nShaft t — — 155,885 535,687 676,495 1,308,353 1,302,626\ng/t — — 4.48 4.37 3.54 3.53 3.79\nMosquito t — — — 8,368 358,879 235,344 —\ng/t — — — 4.34 5.31 4.36 —\nYear 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036\nLowhee t — — — — — — —\ng/t — — — — — — —\nCow t 102,785 108,332 111,743 424,534 1,431,941 1,520,129 24,774\ng/t 4.28 3.86 2.67 3.59 3.39 3.21 3.20\nValley Upper t 73,178 55,075 401,230 333,481 — — —\ng/t 3.35 3.66 3.63 3.57 — — —\nValley Lower t 413,547 733,222 670,563 307,727 86,442 22,581 —\ng/t 4.30 3.69 3.69 3.50 3.35 3.02 —\nShaft t 1,200,306 891,828 611,251 723,113 271,700 248,599 36,605\ng/t 4.23 4.07 3.91 3.85 3.50 3.41 3.09\nMosquito t — — — — — — —\ng/t — — — — — — —\nMine Equipment and Personnel\nDuring pre-production, all development will be conducted by contractors. These contractors will provide the equipment used to\ndevelop lateral advance except for the roadheaders. ODV will take over the development and production work at the beginning of the\nproduction phase, gradually integrating its own equipment according to the needs of the operation.\nThe mine will operate 365 days/year with three different rosters for office and hourly personnel. A total of 298 employees related to\nunderground mining for operation and maintenance services for Phase 2 are anticipated in Wells.\nMineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing\nA preliminary metallurgical testwork program was previously undertaken to determine the metallurgical response on samples\nprepared from drill holes obtained from the Shaft, Cow, and Valley deposits. The testwork consisted of an investigation into the\namenability of mineral sorting to pre-concentrate the run of mine (“ROM”) prior to milling, chemical characterization, a preliminary\nevaluation of comminution characteristics, a series of gravity, flotation and leaching tests, cyanide destruction testing, as well as\npreliminary thickening and rheology tests. The average metallurgical recovery per site is reported in Table 5 below. Based on testwork\nresults and the proposed mine plan at the time, the overall projected gold recovery is 92.1%. The annual recovery projections are\nexpected to differ from the average testwork results according to the final mine proportions of ore zones.\n81\nTable 5: Average Gold Recovery and Process Step\nProcess Step Average Au Stage Recovery (%)\nBonanza Site 96.3\nMine Site Complex 95.3\nQR Mill – Phase 1 96.6\nQR Mill – Phase 2 96.5\nOverall Au Recovery – Phase 1 93.0\nOverall Au Recovery – Phase 2 91.9\nOverall Au Recovery - LOM 92.0\nAdditional testwork on samples from the Lowhee deposit was performed during and after the 2022 PEA. The testwork on samples\nfrom the Shaft, Cow and Valley Zones consisted of metallurgical testing on ore sorting test products, an extended gravity recoverable\ntest, a series of flotation and cyanide leaching testing, a feasibility past fill test, as well as a final dewatering and rheology test. The\nlatest testwork program was completed to characterize and understand the metallurgical response of materials from the Lowhee\ndeposit. The latest testwork included ore sorting tests, comminution tests, leaching tests, and cyanide destruction tests. In addition to\nmetallurgical testing, paste backfill test results are summarized in the Cariboo Technical Report. Paste backfill testwork programs\nwere completed to characterize ore sorter tailings and flotation tailings, to design the paste system, and to determine the backfill\nstrategy. Testwork data from the 2022 PEA, and new testwork with effective date on November 15, 2022 was considered for the\nprocess design.\nRecovery Methods\nThe Cariboo Gold Project will ramp up tonnage in two (2) phases, Phase 1 starting with a 1,500 tpd ore sorting and leaching\nflowsheet, followed by Phase 2 with a 4,900 tpd ore sorting, flotation, and leaching flowsheet.\nIn the first phase, the ore will be processed in two (2) stages at two (2) sites: the Bonanza Ledge Site located at the current Bonanza\nLedge Mine, and the QR Mill located 111 km from the MSC.\nFor the initial throughput, during Phase 1, of 1,500 tpd, a pre-concentrator, including mobile crushing and ore sorting, will be built at\nthe Bonanza Ledge Site. The use of the Bonanza Ledge Site will reduce the overall operation and transportation costs. The crushing\noperation will consist of a two-stage crushing and screening. The crushed product will be processed in an ore sorting circuit. The\nconcentrate from the sorted concentrate will be crushed and then trucked to the QR Mill for further comminution, leaching, and\nrefining.\nThe QR Mill is an existing plant under care and maintenance with a daily capacity to treat 860 t of ore. The QR Mill will require\nrefurbishment of some areas before start-up. A filtration plant will be added to produce dry tailings.\nIn Phase 2, the ore will be processed in two (2) stages at two (2) sites: the MSC and the QR Mill located 111 km west of the MSC.\nFor the expanded throughput of 4,900 tpd, crushing will occur underground and will then be conveyed to the surface, where ore\nsorting, grinding and flotation will be conducted in a services building at the MSC. The MSC services building will serve as a pre-\nconcentration step to reduce the overall operation and transportation costs. The primary crushing operation will be located\nunderground, and the crushed product will be conveyed to the surface to feed a sizing screen. The sizing screen undersize will be\ndischarged into a fine storage bin and the oversize will be sent to the ore sorting circuit. The sorted concentrate will be combined with\nthe fine storage bin material to feed a grinding and flotation circuit. The flotation concentrate will be trucked to the QR Mill for further\ncomminution, leaching, and refining.\nThe QR Mill will be upgraded to process the higher concentrate feed grades in the second phase. Carbon in leach and the ADR\ncircuit will be replaced and the refinery will be upgraded.\n82\nInfrastructure, Permitting and Compliance Activities\nProject Infrastructure\nThe Cariboo Gold Project will include the following infrastructure:\nPhase 1\nBonanza Ledge\n● First phase of the WRSF;\n● Surface water management infrastructure;\n● Fuel systems (liquified natural gas (“LNG”) and diesel storage and distribution);\n● Natural gas power plant;\n● Ore crushing and sorting facility;\nQR Mill\n● Upgrades to the QR Mill to process ore sorting concentrate and a new tailings dewatering circuit;\n● Filtered stack tailings storage facility (“FSTSF”);\n● Water management infrastructure;\n● Relocation and upgrade of the propane system;\n● Improvements to the fire protection system.\nOffsite Infrastructure\n● Construction of an Integrated Remote Operational Centre (“IROC”).\nPhase 2\nMine Site Complex\n● Access roads, bridge, parking lots, security facilities and access gates;\n● Mine surface infrastructure including a portal and mine ventilation and heating infrastructure;\n● Concentrator;\n● Office complex including office space and mine dry facilities;\n● Surface water management infrastructure;\n● MSC water treatment plant and treated effluent discharge line;\n● Fuel systems (LNG and diesel storage and distribution)\n● 66 kV to 13.8 kV electrical substation;\n● Site electrical distribution and lighting;\n83\n● Fiber optic network;\n● Firewater pumping station and distribution piping system;\n● Potable water well, treatment plant and distribution system;\n● Sewage treatment system.\nBonanza Ledge\n● Second phase of the WRSF and associated surface water management infrastructure.\nQR Mill\n● Upgrades to the QR Mill to process high-grade flotation concentrate from the concentrator at the MSC;\n● Information technology (“IT”) and telecom upgrade to support remote process monitoring;\n● Potable water treatment plant and distribution system;\n● Sewage treatment system.\nOffsite Infrastructure\n● 66 kV power line connecting BC Hydro’s Barlow substation to the MSC 66 kV/13.8 kV substation;\n● Increase the number of rooms for worker accommodations;\n● Final expansion of the IROC in Quesnel.\nEnvironmental and Permitting\nRegulatory Context and Environmental Studies\nAn Environmental Assessment (“EA”) for the Cariboo Gold Project was initiated with the submission and acceptance of an Initial\nProject Description (“IPD”) in 2020, as per the BC Environmental Assessment Act (2018) (“BCEAA”), at a production rate of 4,750\ntpd. Submission of the revised application occurred in October 2022, and acceptance to the Effects Assessment Phase was issued by\nthe Environmental Assessment Office of British Columbia on November 30, 2022. Issuance of an Environmental Assessment\nCertificate (“EAC”) is expected after the successful review of the application.\nAs part of the EA Application for the Cariboo Gold Project, site-specific environmental baseline modelling and existing conditions\ncharacterization has been ongoing since 2016, with updates made to various reports following comments from the Technical Advisory\nCommittee, the Participating Indigenous nations and the Community Advisory Committee. ODV has prepared a preliminary list of key\nprovincial and federal authorizations, licenses, and permits that may be required for the Cariboo Gold Project, following the EA\nprocess. The QR Mill and Bonanza Ledge, constituent parts of the Cariboo Gold Project, are authorized under separate Mines Act\nand Environmental Management Act permits, and each have their own associated reclamation bonding and liability estimates.\nExtensive baseline data collection and monitoring occurred as part of permit amendment applications for these sites, and monitoring\ndata continues to be collected in support of site-specific environmental management and permit requirements.\n84\nEnvironmental baseline studies and modelling for the Cariboo Gold Project have been undertaken in the following areas: air quality,\nterrain and soils, vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat, climate and physiography, fisheries and aquatic resources, surface water,\nand groundwater. In addition, ODV has established environmental monitoring plans for a suite of valued components to respond to\nregulatory requirements and best management practices for the Cariboo Gold Project.\nConsiderations of Social and Community Impacts\nSince 2016, ODV has been undertaking meaningful and transparent engagement with Indigenous nations, the public, local\ncommunity members, provincial and local government agencies and other stakeholders, and this engagement is ongoing. Positive\nrelationships have been developed and maintained with three participating indigenous nations, Lhtako Dené Nation, Xatśūll First\nNation, Williams Lake First Nation, and ODV intends to maintain these relationships through all phases of the Cariboo Gold Project.\nMine Reclamation and Closure Plan\nODV has prepared various Reclamation and Closure Plans (“RCP”) for the Cariboo Gold Project to detail how the sites will be\nreclaimed to a safe, stable, and non-polluting condition. An updated RCP was provided as an appendix to the EA for the Cariboo Gold\nProject. RCPs will continue to be updated as mine plans evolve, regulatory guidelines change, and in accordance with permit\nrequirements. The Cariboo Gold Project footprint at each site has been divided into Master Areas to reflect disturbance type and\nproposed end land use. Detailed closure and reclamation prescriptions will be provided for each Master Area.\nPermitting and Required Approvals\nAs outlined above, the Cariboo Gold Project is currently undergoing an EA under the BCEAA given that it will have a production\ncapacity of > 75,000 tonnes per year of mineral ore. However, the Cariboo Gold Project is not subject to federal review under the\nImpact Assessment Act as it does not exceed the relevant threshold specified in the Schedule of Physical Activities specified in the\nfederal Physical Activities Regulations (SOR/2019-285.

The overall capital cost estimate developed in the Cariboo Technical Report generally meets the\nAmerican Association of Cost Engineers (“AACE”) Class 3 requirements and has an accuracy range of between -10% and +15%.\nThe capital cost estimate was compiled using mix of quotations and budgetary quotations, database costs, and database factors.\nItems such as sales taxes, land acquisition, permitting, licensing, feasibility studies, and financing costs are not included in the cost\nestimate.\nCosts are expressed in Q4 2022 Canadian dollars with an exchange rate of CAD 1.00 for USD 0.77 with no allowances for escalation,\ncurrency fluctuation or interest during construction.\nThe cumulative life of mine capital expenditures (“CAPEX”), including initial capital, expansion capital, sustaining capital, is estimated\nto be $1,055 million. The Cariboo Gold Project’s site reclamation and closure costs are estimated at $17.3 million and its salvage\nvalue is expected to be $56.2 million.\nTable 6: Project Capital Costs Summary\nInitial Capital Expansion Sustaining\nCost Capital Cost Capital Cost Total Cost\nWBS Cost Area ($million) ($million) ($million) ($million)\n000 Surface Mobile Equipment — 0.1 9.3 9.4\n200 Underground Mine 53.8 110.8 313.3 478.0\n300 Water and Waste Management 6.5 12.9 37.3 56.7\n400 Electrical and Communication 10.2 31.8 62.9 104.9\n500 Surface Infrastructure 1.8 33.0 2.7 37.5\n600 Process Plant - Wells 5.2 114.5 4.4 124.1\n600 Process Plant – QR Mill 17.5 25.7 — 43.2\n700 Construction Indirect Costs 10.6 55.6 1.1 67.3\n800 General Services 8.7 30.0 27.0 65.7\n900 Pre-production 12.7 — — 12.7\n999 Contingency 10.3 36.7 8.5 55.6\nTotal 137.3 451.1 466.6 1,055.0\nSite Reclamation and Closure — — 17.3 17.3\nSalvage Value — — (56.2) (56.2)\nTotal – Forecast to Spend 137.3 451.1 427.8 1,016.2\n87\nAll capital costs for the Cariboo Gold Project have been distributed against the development schedule to support the economic cash\nflow model. Figure 1 presents the planned annual and cumulative LOM capital cost profile.\nFigure 1: Annual and Cumulative Project Capital Costs\nOperating Costs\nThe operating cost estimate was based on multiple sources, such as budget quotations, in-house data, and ODV’s projected salary\nchart. The operating cost expenditure (“OPEX”) estimate is based on a combination of experience, reference projects, quotes, and\nbudgetary quotes and factors appropriate for an FS study. The target accuracy of the operating costs is ±10%. No cost escalation or\ncontingency has been included within the operating cost estimate.\nThe operating cost estimate includes the costs to mine, transport, and process the ore to produce gold doré. It also includes costs for\ntailings management, water treatment, and general and administration expenses (“G&A”).\nThe average operating cost over the 12-year mine life is estimated to be $102.6 per tonne mined. Total LOM and unit operating cost\nestimates are summarized and shown on a percentage basis in Table 7. Mining costs are presented inclusive of costs related to\nbackfilling, including paste backfilling. Processing costs are presented inclusive of the flotation circuit during Phase 2 of the Cariboo\nGold Project, as well as the costs related to ore sorting for both phases of the Cariboo Gold Project.\n88\nTable 7: Total Operating Cost Breakdown\nPhase 1 Phase 2 Annual\nunit cost unit cost Average LOM LOM average cost Average LOM OPEX\nArea Cost Area Description ($/t mined) ($/t mined) ($/tonne mined) ($million) ($million) ($/oz) (%)\n000 Mineralized material transport 17.3 3.5 4.8 79.5 7.0 42.5 5%\n200 Underground mining 77.6 51.1 53.6 894.9 78.4 478.7 52%\n300 Water and waste management 18.4 6.1 7.2 120.7 10.6 64.6 7%\nProcessing - Mine Site Complex\n600 and QR 37.1 25.3 26.4 440.4 38.5 235.6 26%\n800 General and administration 19.4 9.8 10.7 178.8 15.7 95.7 10%\nTotal 169.8 95.8 102.6 1,714.4 150.2 917.0 100%\nNote:\n(1) Water and waste management and G&A operating costs do not include a portion of the expenditures which have been\ncapitalized.

Inflation or cost escalation factors were not taken into account. The base case gold price is US$1,700/oz.\n89\nThe economic analysis presented in this section contains forward-looking information with regards to the Mineral Resource Estimates,\ncommodity prices, exchange rates, proposed mine production plan, projected recovery rates, operating costs, construction costs, and\nproject schedule. The results of the economic analysis are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other\nfactors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those presented here.\nThe input parameters used and results of the financial analysis are presented in Table 9.\nThe pre-tax base case financial model resulted in an internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 24.4% and a NPV of $691M using a 5% discount\nrate. The pre-tax payback period after start of operations is 5.8 years. On an after-tax basis, the base case financial model resulted in\nan IRR of 20.7% and a NPV of $502M using a 5% discount rate. The after-tax payback period after start of operations is 5.9 years.\nThe all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) including royalties over the LOM are US$968.1/oz.\nTable 9: Financial Analysis Summary\nDescription Unit Value\nTotal Tonnes Mined M tonne (Mt) 16.7\nAverage Diluted Gold Grade g/t 3.78\nTotal Gold Contained oz 2,031,153\nTotal Gold Payable oz 1,868,856\nAverage Annual Gold Produced Au oz per year 163,695\nTotal Initial Capital Cost $M 137.3\nTotal Expansion Capital Cost $M 451.1\nSustaining Capital $M 466.6\nSite Reclamation Cost $M 17.3\nSalvage Value $M 56.2\nOperating Costs $/t mined 102.6\nAll-in Sustaining Costs USD/oz 968.1\nTotal LOM NSR Revenue $M 4,126\nLOM Royalties $M 206.3\nTotal LOM Pre-Tax Cash Flow $M 1,191.7\nAverage Annual Pre-tax Cash Flow $M 104.4\nLOM Taxes $M 290.6\nTotal LOM After-Tax Free Cash Flow $M 901.1\nAverage Annual After-Tax Free Cash Flow $M 78.9\nValuation Summary\nPre-Tax NPV (at 5% Discount Rate) $M 691\nPre-Tax IRR % 24.4\nPre-Tax Payback (after start of operations) year 5.8\nAfter-Tax NPV (at 5% Discount Rate) $M 502\nAfter-Tax IRR % 20.7\nAfter-Tax Payback (after start of operations) year 5.9\nNote:\n(1) Not including sunk costs ($2.5 million) and pre-permit expenses ($64.8 million) totalling $67.3 million.\nA financial sensitivity analysis was conducted on the Cariboo Gold Project’s after tax NPV and IRR using the following variables:\ncapital cost (pre-production and sustaining) operating costs, USD:CAD exchange rate, and the price of gold.\nThe graphical representations of the financial sensitivity analysis on NPV and IRR are depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The\nsensitivity analysis reveals that the USD:CAD exchange rate and gold price have the most significant influence on both NPV and IRR\ncompared to the other parameters, based on the range of values evaluated. After the USD:CAD exchange rates and gold price, NPV\nwas most impacted by changes in operating costs and then, to a lesser extent, capital costs. It should be noted that the economic\nviability of the Cariboo Gold Project will not be significantly negatively impacted by variations in the capital cost, within the margins of\nerror associated with the FS capital cost estimate.\n90\nAfter the USD:CAD exchange rates and gold price, the Cariboo Gold Project’s IRR was most impacted by variation in capital costs,\nand to a lesser extent by the operating costs.\nOverall, the NPV and IRR of the Cariboo Gold Project are generally positive over most of the range of values used for the sensitivity\nanalysis when analyzed individually.\nFigure 2: After-Tax Sensitivity Analysis – Net Present Value (NPV)\nFigure 3: After-Tax Sensitivity Analysis – Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n91\nProject Schedule and Organization\nODV will assemble a team to manage the Cariboo Gold Project technical studies and the Cariboo Gold Project construction. All\nProject phases, including detailed engineering, procurement, pre-production, and construction activities will be under the direction of\nthe Chief Operating Officer of ODV. Permitting and Project financing will be supported and performed by ODV’s Project Development\nTeam and Financial teams, respectively.\nDuring Phase 1, the construction activities were planned in close coordination with pre-production activities with the aim of respecting\nthe existing lodging facilities in Wells and the existing camp at the QR Mill site. During Phase 2, given the substantially higher\nconstruction labour requirements at the MSC, the construction activities were planned to respect the new lodging capacity at Wells\nand the existing satellite facilities.\nThe preliminary on-site workforce requirement for construction, including infrastructure, concentrator, and development of the\nunderground mine is expected to be 635 construction personnel to ramp up the Cariboo Gold Project to 4,900 tpd for 2027.\nThe implementation of Phase 2 will be undertaken in such a way as to turn over key process components of Phase 2 during Phase 1\nprogressively, so that the concurrent operation availability is not dramatically impacted. As an example, at the QR Mill site, the\nschedule to implement the new carbon in pulp (“CIP”) circuit will be undertaken ahead of time to enable the dismantlement of the\nexisting CIP circuit of Phase 1 in the process building and allow for enough time for the construction of the elution circuit at that same\nlocation. Similarly during Phase 2, the ore sorters at Bonanza Ledge will be progressively dismantled and inserted in the services\nbuilding at the MSC during ramp-up to minimize the downtime of operations at QR Mill and the downtime of commissioning and ramp-\nup at the MSC.\nPending the completion of all studies and receipt of the required permits, the development of Lowhee Zone is scheduled to begin in\nQ4 2023 while the concentrator and MSC infrastructure construction is scheduled to begin in Q3 2025 with full capacity production\nbeginning in Q3 2027.\n92\nThe major Project activity milestones are presented in Table 10.\nTable 10: Key Milestones\nActivity Date\nPre-Permit Activities\nDetail engineering activities for Phase 1 Q1 2023\nStart of bulk sample Lowhee Zone Q1 2023\nStart of engineering to support permitting Q1 2023\nEnd of bulk sample Lowhee Zone Q4 2023\nWater drawdown commencement at TMF – QR Mill Site Q1 2023\nNew water treatment plant construction – QR Mill Site Q2 2023\nNew water treatment plant operation – QR Mill Site Q3 2023\nWater management infrastructure – Bonanza Ledge Site Q3 2023\nNew water treatment plant construction – Bonanza Ledge Site Q3 2023\nSanitary upgrades at Ballarat Camp Q3 2023\nNew water treatment plant operation– Bonanza Ledge Site Q4 2023\nWater drawdown Completion at TMF – QR Mill Site Q2 2024\nPhase 1\nCariboo Gold Project’s EAC application and reception of certificate Q1/Q2 2023\nConstruction of waste rock storage facility at Bonanza Ledge Q2 2023\nCommitment to equipment packages Q3 2023\nStart of dismantling activities as part of Care and Maintenance for Lowhee extraction Q4 2023\nStart of underground development Q4 2023\nWaste rock storage facility ready for storage at Bonanza Ledge Site Q1 2024\nStart of major construction at QR Mill – Phase 1 Q4 2023\nStart construction of ore sorting facility at Bonanza Ledge Q2 2024\nCommissioning of ore sorting facility at Bonanza Ledge Q3 2024\nCommissioning of QR Mill – Phase 1 Q3 2024\nRamp-up to 1,500 tpd Q4 2024\nPhase 1 commercial production achieved Q4 2024\nPhase 2\nTransmission line license of occupation Q3 2023\nExpansion of Ballarat Camp Q2 2025\nSite preparation at MSC Q2 2025\nStart of transmission line clearing and construction Q4 2025\nBC Hydro grid tie-in Q3 2026\nStart of Major Construction at MSC Q3 2025\nCommissioning WTP at MSC Q1 2026\nStart of construction at QR Mill Q3 2026\nCommissioning of QR Mill new process components Q3 2027\nCommissioning process plant at the MSC Q3 2027\nRamp up to 4,900 tpd Q3 2027\nPhase 2 commercial production achieved Q4 2027\nInterpretations and Conclusions\nThe Cariboo Technical Report was prepared to demonstrate the economic viability of developing the Cariboo Gold Project resources\nas an underground mine, and pre-concentrating the ore using an ore sorter circuit followed by flotation and transportation from the\nMSC to the QR Mill for further processing by gravity and leaching. The Cariboo Technical Report provides a summary of the results\nand findings from each major area of investigation. Standard industry practices, equipment, and processes were used. To date, the\nQPs are not aware of any unusual or significant risks or uncertainties that could materially affect the reliability or confidence in the\nCariboo Gold Project based on the information available.\n93\nThe results of the Cariboo Technical Report indicate that the proposed Cariboo Gold Project has technical and financial merit using\nthe base case assumptions. The QPs consider the FS results sufficiently reliable and recommend that the Cariboo Gold Project be\nadvanced to the next stage of development through the initiation of Phase 1 detailed engineering.\nThe following conclusions are based on the QPs detailed review of all pertinent information:\n● The results demonstrate the geological and grade continuities for all eight (8) gold deposits in the Cow-Island-Barkerville\nMountain Corridor.\n● In a potential underground scenario, the Cariboo Gold Project contains an estimated Measured Resource of 8,000 ounces of\ngold, and Indicated Resource of 3,463,000 ounces, and an Inferred Resource of 1,621,000 ounces.\n● The resource estimates for the Mosquito, Shaft, Valley, Cow, and Lowhee deposits were updated using the 2021 drill results.\nAdditional diamond drilling on multiple zones would likely increase the Inferred Resources and upgrade some of the Inferred\nResources to Indicated Resources.\n● The selected flowsheet for processing material from the deposits includes mineral sorting, grinding, flotation and leaching.\nThe process at the Mine Site Complex produces a pre-concentrate consisting of mineral sorting concentrate in Phase I and in\nPhase II mineral sorting and flotation concentrate both Phases concentrates are transported to the QR Mill for further milling\nand leaching. Based on the testwork results and the proposed mining plan at the time, the overall projected Au recovery is\n92.0%.\n● The Cariboo Gold Project mine layout demonstrates a development intensive stope access requirement and therefore has a\nhigh development meter per tonne of mineralized material ratio. These factors may pose a challenge to successful\nimplementation of the mine plan given the restrictive geotechnical parameters and intrinsically lower productivities of the\nmining method. However, through diligent planning and adherence to proper work procedures, sufficient active headings and\nstoping areas should meet daily production requirements.\n● The use of innovative technologies and techniques may improve productivity: Such as roadheaders, and the use of\nautonomous equipment.\n● The environmental baseline work completed to date is sufficient to support a FS. Further work is underway, as required, to\nsupport the Environmental Assessment process and permit applications for the Cariboo Gold Project.\n● The information and assumptions used in the design of the Mine Site Complex, Bonanza Ledge, and QR Mill infrastructure\nare sufficient to support a feasibility study. Further work is underway and recommended to support subsequent design\nphases.\n● The total capital costs (initial, expansion and sustaining) for the Cariboo Gold Project were estimated at $1,055.0 million, and\nthe average operating costs over the 12-year mine life is estimated to be $102.6/tonne mined. The AISC including royalties\nover the LOM are US$968.1/oz.\n● The financial analysis performed as part of the Cariboo Technical Report using the base case assumptions results in an after-\ntax NPV 5% of $502.4 million and an internal rate of return of 20.7% (base case exchange rate of 0.77 CAD for 1.00 USD).\nThe cumulative cash flow for the Cariboo Gold Project (after-tax) is $901.1 million and the payback period after start of\noperations is 5.9 years over the planned mine life of 12 years.\nThe QPs consider the FS to be reliable, thorough, based on quality data, reasonable hypotheses, and parameters compliant with NI\n43-101 requirements and CIM Definition Standards.\nRisks and Opportunities\nAn analysis of the results of the investigations has identified a series of risks and opportunities associated with each of the technical\naspects considered for the development of the Cariboo Gold Project.\n94\nPotential Risks\nThe most significant potential risks associated with the Cariboo Gold Project are:\n● The planned daily mining production rate may be difficult to achieve due to geological continuity issues, geotechnical issues,\npossible interaction of equipment, automation constraints, and other potential slowdowns resulting in a longer mining cycle\ntime;\n● Greater water inflow than anticipated leading to an increase in water pumping and treatment capital and operational costs;\n● There is currently limited contingency storage if the water treatment system at the QR site is unable to operate or meet\ndischarge criteria. A mitigation approach could include consideration of additional contingency storage locations and\nmaintaining pumping system redundancy;\n● Tailings and paste management: Different distribution between ore sorting and flotation will make it harder to manage\ndifferent streams. (Mitigation: old workings to help);\n● The inability to locate an appropriate borrow source for aggregate material near the Mine Site would increase the cost and\nenvironmental impact of the Cariboo Gold Project due to transporting the material over a greater distance;\n● Discovery of an unidentified contaminant that cannot be treated by the chosen mine water treatment systems (complexity of\ncontaminants) may lead to increased water treatment costs;\n● The inability, for technical or permitting reasons, to use the old underground galleries at BL as a flood management reservoir\nmay lead to the need for an additional basin at surface, resulting in higher capital costs and possible project delays.\nSeveral of the previous noted risks are common to most mining projects, many of which may be mitigated, at least to some degree,\nwith adequate engineering, planning, and pro-active management.\nKey Opportunities\nThere are several opportunities that could improve the economics, timing, and/or permitting potential of the Cariboo Gold Project. The\nkey opportunities that have been identified at this time are as follows:\n● Additional exploration surface definition diamond drilling could identify new resource areas and upgrade Inferred resources to\nthe Indicated category;\n● The opportunity exists to examine alternative mining methods that could be considered in certain areas of the mine. In veins\nof sufficient width and continuity, the application of transverse longhole stoping could be considered which may allow for\nimproved mine operations, lower capital and/or operating costs.\n● Additional geotechnical data will be collected during the Lowhee bulk sample and the underground development of Phase 1,\nincluding geotechnical mapping and underground geotechnical core drilling. This information could result in design\nmodifications with lower operating or capital costs.\n● A geometallurgical system should be implemented that would gather and analyse data collected during definition drilling and\nmapping to collect geotechnical, rock mass, and mineralogical properties. This should allow for the optimization of the mine\nsequence and cost structure to maximize the economics of each individual stope within the life of mine;\n● There is a capital cost reduction opportunity to possibly mix non-potentially acid generating waste rock material with borrow\npit aggregate for the construction of some of the civil and water management infrastructure at the MSC;\n95\n● Refinement of water quality model and additional hydrogeological investigations during Phase 1 of the mine operations may\nallow for MSC water treatment plant design improvements potentially leading to lower capital and/or operating costs.\nRecommendations\nBased on the results of the 2022 FS, the QPs recommend that the Cariboo Gold Project move to an advanced phase of development\nwhich would involve detail engineering and that project execution activities commence at ODV’s discretion.\nSpecifically, the QPs recommend continuing ODV’s exploration program, completing the bulk sample, and various pre-permitting\nactivities (see below for details).\nIt is recommended that the drilling (infill and exploration), geological mapping, and grab sampling test the extensions of known high-\ngrade vein corridors and identify new targets.\nThe recommended work program is detailed below:\n(a) Exploration Work:\nBased on the results of the 2022 FS MRE, it is recommended that the Cariboo Gold Project deposit be advanced to the next phase.\nAdditional exploration and delineation drilling, as well as further geological and structural interpretation are recommended to\ndetermine the extents of the gold mineralization. The recommended geology work program is detailed below. Infill drilling in high-\ngrade vein corridors (greater than 6.0 g/t Au) is recommended to convert resources currently categorized as Inferred to the Indicated\ncategory. A budget of 130,000 m of drilling is recommended for this program.\n(b) Complete the bulk sample:\nUnderground bulk sampling program to test geological and grade continuities, metallurgical and geotechnical parameters.\n(c) Pre-permitting work:\nA budget for the proposed program was proposed to serve as a guideline for the Cariboo Gold Project. The budget is presented in\nTable 11 and amounts to a total budget of $114.8 million. The QPs believe the recommended work program and proposed\nexpenditures are appropriate and well thought out, and that the proposed budget reasonably reflects the contemplated activities.\nAdditional recommendations and further details on those can be found in Chapter 26 of the Cariboo Technical Report.\nTable 11: Work Program Budget\nWork Program Cost Estimate ($million)\nInfill and exploration drilling (130,000 m) 30.0\nSurface mapping and sampling 0.5\nBulk Sample 15.0\nPre-Permitting Work 57.2\n000-Mobile equipment 4.3\n200-Underground mine 3.1\n300-Water and waste management 21.9\n400-Electrical and communication 7.4\n500-Surface infrastructure 0.4\n600-Processing – Mine Site Complex 3.4\n600-Processing – QR Mill 4.7\n700-Construction indirect costs 12.0\nSub-Total 102.7\nContingency 12.1\nTotal 114.8\n96\nTINTIC PROJECT\nScientific and technical information relating to the Tintic project located in Utah (UT) (the “Tintic Project”) provided in this AIF is\nsupported by the most recent technical report on the Tintic Project filed in accordance with NI 43-101, titled “NI 43-101 Technical\nReport, Initial Mineral Resource Estimate for the Trixie Deposit, Tintic Project, Utah, United States of America” dated January 27,\n2023, with an effective date of January 10, 2023 (the “Tintic Technical Report”) prepared, reviewed, and approved by William J.\nLewis, P. Geo, Ing. Alan J. San Martin, MAusIMM (CP) and Richard Gowans, P. Eng. Mr. Lewis, Mr. San Martin and Mr. Gowans are\nemployees of Micon International Limited (Micon) and are considered to be “independent” of ODV for purposes of Section 1.5 of NI\n43-101. Reference should be made to the full text of the Tintic Technical Report, which is available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and\non EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under ODV’s issuer profile. The Tintic Technical Report is subject to certain assumptions, qualifications\nand procedures described therein.\nScientific or technical information in respect of the Tintic Project contained in this AIF was prepared by or under the supervision of\nMaggie Layman, Vice President Exploration of the Corporation, who is a “qualified person” for purposes of NI 43-101.\nProperty Description and Ownership\nThe Tintic Project is located in western Utah County, approximately 64 km south of Provo, Utah and 95 km south of Salt Lake City.\nThe property on which the Trixie test mine or Trixie deposit is located encompasses most of the East Tintic District, surrounding and\nimmediately east of the incorporated town of Eureka. The township of Eureka is located approximately 6.4 km northwest of the Trixie\ntest mine.\nThe coordinates of the center of the Project are 407,700mE and 4,423,400mN, referenced in NAD83, Northern UTM Zone 12. The\nProject area is located on Eureka Quadrangle, U.S. Topographic Map 1:24,000 scale, 7.5 Minute Series.\nThe nearest rail siding, in use, is located at Tintic Junction, approximately 10 km west of the Project.\n97\nTintic Project Property Outline within the East Tintic District\nThe area of the Tintic Project owned or controlled by ODV comprises 1,105 claims totalling 5,746 ha (14,200 acres) of patented\nmining claims and a further 107 mining claims of approximately 1,214 ha (3,000 acres), which are overwhelmingly leased patented\nmining claims. ODV owns a small and varying percentage, interest or royalty in a number of other claims outside the main claim\npackage.\nODV verified the status of the mineral title to certain patented mining claims by engaging UT legal counsel to conduct a review of\nODV’s chain of title for the select patented mining claims within the land package covering approximately 243 ha (600 acres)\nsurrounding the Trixie and Burgin mines. UT legal counsel conducted their title review by examining the United States Bureau of Land\nManagement records, including the patents issued by the United States, mineral survey and master title plans, and the official records\nof the UT County Recorder’s Office, including the abstract (tract), mining claims, and grantor/grantee indices, among miscellaneous\nother records. This consolidated land position has been acquired over a hundred years of prior consolidation in the District. The\nCorporation also engaged with Wolcott LLC, an independent consultant to conduct field checks and generate a geospatial database.\nOn May 30, 2022, ODV announced the acquisition of 100% of Tintic Consolidated Metals LLC (“TCM”) (the “Acquisition”) from IG\nTintic LLC (“IG Tintic”) and Chief Consolidated Mining Co. (“CCMC”) for total consideration at closing of approximately US$177\nmillion in cash and shares of Osisko and:\n1. US$12.5 million in deferred payments\n2. a 2% NSR royalty, with a 50% buyback right in favour of ODV exercisable within five (5) years; and\n98\n3. other contingent payments, rights and obligations.\nA map showing surface ownership for the Tintic Project is presented below:\nTintic Project Surface Ownership\nEncumbrances and Other Significant Factors or Risks\nEncumbrances\nPermitting of the Trixie test mine is well advanced, with many project components already permitted and bonded by the Utah Division\nof Oil, Gas and Mining (“DOGM”). These include the Trixie shaft and surface facilities. Full development of the Trixie test mine will\nrequire a number of additional Agency approvals, none of which is anticipated to be problematic to obtain. Pursuant to the Stream\nAgreement between TCM and Osisko Bermuda dated August 12, 2022, Osisko Bermuda has a first ranking security interest over all\nof the present and future assets of TCM. TCM is a division of ODV.\nOther Significant Factors and Risks\nEffective upon the closing of the Acquisition, ODV’s rights to use and access all surface and water rights conveyed to Emerald Hollow\nLLC (“Emerald Hollow”) are governed by a Framework Agreement executed at closing and dated effective\n99\nMay 27, 2022 (the “Framework Agreement”). Under the Framework Agreement, ODV has the right to conduct exploration activities\nand has agreed easements to use the surface rights owned by Emerald Hollow. ODV also has the right to purchase surface rights\nfrom Emerald Hollow at market rates if it has reasonably determined that actual use and occupation of such lands for facilities for\nmore than eighteen (18) months are necessary for economic exploitation of proven or probable reserves or measured, indicated, or\ninferred resources.\nODV has also retained a right of first offer in the event that Emerald Hollow desires to sell, assign, or otherwise transfer to a third\nparty all or a portion of its interest in the surface rights it owns, as well as a first priority right to purchase from Emerald Hollow, at a\nprice based on prevailing market rates, a maximum annual water flow rate of 2.45 cubic feet per second (cfs) and a maximum annual\nvolume of 1,776.64 acre-feet of water from Emerald Hollow for its mining activities.\nPermitting and Environmental Liabilities\nEnvironment\nTCM maintains adequate financial surety of US$1,473,167 with the UT DOGM. This Financial surety was last updated in August 2021\nwith the addition of a pilot process operation. TCM is currently in the process of updating its large mine permit with UT DOGM and\nexpects the surety to be updated as part of this process.\nTCM maintains all necessary environmental permits to operate within the Tintic operations area, including the current large mine\npermit update. As part of this update, environmental resources within the Tintic Test Mine were reviewed. As of the date of the Tintic\nTechnical Report, all water rights and other water sources have been secured and agreed upon. Furthermore, the U.S. Fish and\nWildlife Service has deemed that this area does not contain areas of critical wildlife concern.\nPermits and Environmental Liabilities\nTCM is working under the Notice of Intent Large Mine Operations (“LMO”) plan permit approved by the Utah DOGM in 2017. An\nupdated LMO was submitted in February, 2022 and a revised version in November and is currently going through the review/approval\nprocess. TCM has exploration permits in place (i.e., surety bonding) to support surface diamond drilling and the excavation of the\nTrixie Portal (Brandy Lee Decline). Once approved, the exploration for the decline will fall within the updated LMO. Under agreement\nwith the UT DOGM and the UT Department of Water Quality (DWQ), TCM is permitted to operate a pilot processing facility and a tails\nholding pad. TCM does not discharge any water or effluents from current operations.\nAccessibility, Climate and Infrastructure\nThe closest major airport to the Tintic Project is in Salt Lake City, UT, located to the north-northwest of the city of Provo, UT via\nInterstate 15. Access to the Tintic Project from Provo, is via Interstate 15, a distance of 36 km south to exit 248 to US 6, then west on\nUS 6, 27 km to Silver Pass Road, and then south 3.2 km to the Burgin project office site. The Trixie test mine is located 2.6 km\nsouthwest of the Burgin office on the paved Silver Pass Access Road. Provo and other smaller towns, including Payson, Santaquin\nand Eureka are also adjacent to the Project.\nThe towns of Goshen, Santaquin, Payson and Provo are the main sources for supplies and services. Tintic Project personnel and\ncontractors also live in these areas.\nThe Tintic Project has sufficient power and water to support a mining operation.\nTopographic relief in the East Tintic District ranges from 1,494 m in the Goshen Valley east of the District to 1,996 m at nearby Mineral\nHill. The elevation at Trixie is at an elevation of 1,852 m.\nThe Tintic Mountains bear the scanty vegetation typical of an arid region. Different species of cactus, forbs and shrubs grow on\nexposed rocky points. The more common trees of the higher slopes are pinyon pine, juniper and mountain mahogany. At lower\nelevations, maple thickets occur in the dry ravines, especially on the eastern slopes, while aspens are found in sheltered spots, more\ncommonly those of northern exposure. In the valleys, sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Brigham’s tea and cheat grass constitute almost the\nsole vegetation. Range improvement projects in the area have had some effect on improving grazing.\n100\nThe climate of the East Tintic District is semi-arid. The U.S. Climate data website noted that the mean monthly low temperatures at\nthe nearby town of Elberta range from -10° Celsius (C) (15° Fahrenheit (F)) in January to 15°C (58°F) in July. The mean monthly high\ntemperatures range from 2°C (37°F) in January to 33°C (93°F) in July. The Project has year-round access and operating season.\nThe Tintic Project’s main office, laboratory, workshops and onsite processing facilities are located at the Burgin site, immediately off\nHighway 6 and northeast of the Trixie test mine. The Burgin mine is a past-producing underground operation that was last mined in\n1976. All references to Burgin are with respect to the main office and surface facilities located at this site, not the Trixie test mine or\ndeposit unless otherwise specified.\nA mill facility previously operational in 2002 is located at the Burgin site. In October, 2021, a pilot vat leaching circuit was established\nwithin the old Burgin mill facility for the recovery of gold and silver from of the mineralized material from the Trixie test mine. ODV’s\nrecent operations also included trucking mineralized material to an offsite facility for vat and heap leaching. This activity occurred from\nlate 2020 up to May, 2022.\nIn 2022, a pilot tailings facility was constructed on site adjacent to the mill facility. The facility was double lined for future re-\npermitting/repurpose as a heap leach facility.\nThe onsite laboratory at the Burgin site provides fire assay analysis for gold and silver for all underground grade control sampling\nfrom the Trixie test mine. Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) and bottle roll analysis to complement onsite VAT leaching and\nprocessing has also been established. Using an onsite laboratory to assay samples generated on site is common practice in the\nmining industry. Onsite laboratories usually participate in round robin exercises with government or independent laboratories as part\nof their Quality Assurance and Quality Control programs. In addition, onsite laboratories, such as the Burgin site usually send out\ncheck samples and engage laboratory auditing consultants to independently review their procedures.\nThe mineral property is sufficiently large that construction of further infrastructure at the Project will not be hindered by lack of space.\nHistory\nAll “reserves” and “resources” estimates provided in this section are historical in nature and should not be relied upon. The QP has\nnot done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. It is unlikely they comply\nwith current NI 43-101 requirements or follow CIM Definitional Standards, and their relevance and reliability have not been verified.\nThey are included in this section for illustrative purposes only and ODV is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral\nreserves. For the purposes of this section, the term “ore” is being used in a historical context.\nTintic District – Early Mining History (1869 to 2002)\nEconomic mineralization in the Tintic District was first discovered in 1869 and, within a few years, most of the major outcropping ore\nbodies were being mined and many of the historic mining towns, including Diamond, Silver City, Mammoth, Eureka, Dividend and\nKnightsville had been established. By 1899, the Tintic District had become one of the richest mining districts in the United States.\nActive mining in the district continued through the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century.\nEast Tintic District\nEven though many claims in what is now identified as the East Tintic District had been staked before the turn of the 20th century, the\nonly known occurrence of surface mineralization was in a small outcrop near the present Eureka Lilly shaft. All future discoveries of\nthe blind ore bodies in the East Tintic District have been based on surface alteration and underground geological interpretation.\nE.J. Raddatz became interested in the East Tintic District around 1906 and acquired a major holding in what is now the Tintic\nStandard area. Raddatz reasoned that, even though the surface rocks were inhospitable, there was a chance of discovery in the\nOphir limestone at depth. It took a considerable amount of time, two shafts and thousands of feet (ft) of drift\n101\nand winze workings but, in 1916, the Tintic Standard deposit was discovered and went on to become one of the major lead-silver\nmines in the world.\nMining geologists, attracted by the discovery of the Tintic Standard deposit, began to study the district. Based on these studies, a long\ndrive on the 700 level of the Tintic Standard mine was commissioned. This exploration work intersected the mineral deposit that\nbecame the North Lily mine. Similar strategies led to the discovery of the Eureka Standard mine.\nDuring World War II, the United States recognized that, in the event of a long war, new sources of raw material would be essential. As\na result, the U.S. Geological Survey (“USGS”) undertook an exploration program seeking blind ore bodies in the East Tintic District.\nOne of the blind targets identified by the USGS was the CCMC oxide area, a prominent outcrop of oxidized and pyritized volcanics\nwhich overlies the Burgin deposit. However, no major discovery was made from either the sinking of the 22.6 m (75 ft) deep CCMC\nshaft or the drift from the Apex Standard mine. It was later surface drilling that made the discovery of the Burgin ore body.\nDistrict production slowly increased through discovery of new mines and peaked between 1921 and 1930. From that peak, production\ndecreased to a low between 1961 and 1970. Production from the Burgin mine led to a second peak of between 1971 and 1976.\nTrixie – Exploration Underground Development and Mining (1927 to 1995)\nTrixie Early Exploration (Pre-1957)\nFollowing the discovery of the Tintic Standard deposit in 1917, the North Lily deposit in 1927 and the Eureka Standard deposit in\n1928, interest was sparked over a poorly exposed structure overlying the current location of the Trixie test mine.\nIntense hydrothermal alteration of volcanic rocks exposed at surface at the Trixie site attracted the attention of the U.S. Bureau of\nMines, which, in 1946-1947 conducted a number of studies in the Trixie area.\nBetween 1954-1955 the USGS conducted sampling and mapping of the area immediately north of the current Trixie shaft location.\nThis was followed up by the drilling that confirmed the presence of the Trixie fault and the validity of the surface anomalies when low-\ngrade lead-zinc ore was intersected in the Trixie fault zone. After the conclusion of the USGS research program in 1956, Bear Creek\nMining completed additional holes in the target area and several of these holes intersected strong lead-zinc replacement\nmineralization in the underlying limestone. Despite the apparent presence of ore-grade mineralization at depth, the disappointing core\nrecoveries resulted in surface exploration work being terminated in 1957. Subsequently, the decision was made to conduct future\nexploration from underground.\nTrixie - Shaft Sinking and Underground Development and Mining (1968 to 1992)\nThe sinking of the Trixie shaft was initiated in 1968 and had reached the 750 ft level by 1969. Although the initial target of exploration\nat the Trixie historic mine was lead-zinc replacement mineralization in the hanging wall of the Trixie Fault, a gold-bearing structure\nwas encountered during shaft sinking. This northerly-trending and steeply west-dipping structural zone became the primary source of\nore, which was concentrated along three gold-silver mineralized shoots referred to as the 756 ore shoot, the 75-85 ore shoot, and the\nSurvey zone.\nThe original carbonate replacement deposit (CRD) that was discovered at the Trixie historic mine in 1969 is located on the north end\nof the deposit within the downthrown carbonate sequence north of the Trixie fault. While limited in scale, the replacement\nmineralization consists of massive sulphide minerals and jasperoid between the 750 ft level and 900 ft level.\nThe 756 ore shoot represents the most productive of the three (3) historically mined ore zones. This ore shoot plunges to the north,\ntowards the Trixie and Eureka Standard faults and was mined continuously from approximately 75 ft above the 625 level to below the\ndeepest 1350 level development. Based on limited historic drilling it remains open at depth.\nIn 1976, as mining and exploration continued within the 756 ore shoot, the 75-85 ore shoot was discovered approximately 1,600 ft\n(488 m) south of the Trixie shaft. The 75-85 ore shoot was mined from approximately 50 ft (15 m) above the 625 level down to the\n1200 level.\n102\nIn early 1980, Bear Creek Mining discovered the Survey zone while exploring for the Sioux-Ajax fault by drifting south on the 1050 ft\nlevel of the Trixie historic mine. The Survey vein segment was explored and extensively developed by Kennecott on the 750, 900,\n1050 and 1200 levels during the pre-1995 silica flux mining periods. The southern end of the Survey Vein is extended for a distance\nof 3,400 ft south of the main shaft along the 1050 level and it remains open to the south and at depth.\nIn 1980, Sunshine Mining Corporation leased the Burgin unit from CCMC and by 1983 had also begun work at Trixie where it re-\nstarted mining operations and undertook additional underground development and diamond drilling. Much of the underground\ndevelopment and drilling from this time appears to have been focused on the 900, 1050, 1200 and 1350 levels. Perhaps the most\nnotable exploration efforts at Trixie during this time were the southerly extensions of the 900, 1050 and 1200 ft level drifts, following\nthe discovery of the Survey zone and the northeastward extension from the 1350 ft level to connect with the 1100 ft level of the\nEureka Standard mine. This connection provided the underground access needed to evaluate the Eureka Standard fault along-strike\nand down-dip from the original Eureka Standard mine workings. Sunshine operated the Trixie historic mine until terminating their\nlease with CCMC at the end of 1992.\nTrixie Exploration and Production (2000 to 2002)\nBetween 2000 and 2002, CCMC (through its affiliate Tintic Utah Metals LLC) undertook an aggressive surface and underground\ndrilling program at Trixie resulting in the discovery of a small-tonnage gold-silver resource associated with the earlier mined 75-85\nmineralized zone. The 625 ft level was developed within the mine in 2001, but mining was suspended due to the decrease in the price\nof gold below $300/oz and CCMC’s financial and reported management problems.\nTrixie Exploration and Production (2019 to 2021)\nTCM – Trixie, Modern Target Generation (2019 to 2020)\nTCM acquired the historical Trixie mine at the beginning of 2019, and initially focused its assessment on the base-metal resource\nopportunity at the Burgin mine. However, high-grade gold opportunities that had potential for near-term production and revenue at\nTrixie quickly became the focus of the company. Since most of the historic mining was focused on the steep west-dipping structural\ncorridor with very little development or exploration into either the footwall or hanging wall, there was high potential to define additional\nmineralized structures in close proximity to the existing underground infrastructure.\nIn August, 2019, TCM made the decision to commence rehabilitation of the historic mine and shaft, with the intention of beginning\nunderground drilling and exploration of documented targets on the historic 625 ft and 750 ft development levels.\nBy December, 2019, TCM had compiled the historic Trixie datasets into a new 3D model of the deposit and identified a significant new\ntarget in the immediate footwall to the 610 stope. This new target, initially termed the North Survey Vein, was developed from\nreconsidering assays within historic surface RC holes which could not have originated from any of the historically mined areas.\nFurther investigation of this target led to the discovery of the T2 and T4 structures.\nThe broad zones of mineralization encountered in the 2000-2001 surface RC drilling were originally interpreted to be caused by the\nsmearing of mineralization within the holes. However, 2021 exploration work by TCM demonstrated that mineralization up to 60 ft in\nwidth is associated with the T4 stockwork. The broad zones of mineralization encountered in the 2000-2001 RC drilling were thus re-\ninterpreted as intercepts of T2-T4 stockwork mineralization in the immediate footwall of the 75-85 structure.\nTCM T2 Discovery (2020 to 2021)\nBetween February and June, 2020, refurbishment of the 625 level was completed and this allowed for the commencement of\nunderground diamond drilling. A total of five (5) diamond drill holes were completed between June and August, 2020.\nDespite extremely difficult drilling conditions, visible mineralization within the footwall of the 610 stope was confirmed in three (3) of\nthe five (5) holes. With the visual confirmation of the mineralization and structure, a decision was made by TCM management to\ncommence development of an exploration drift eastward towards the target zone.\n103\nThe decision to develop into the target zone proved extremely fortuitous as only 13 m (44 ft) east of the historic 625 ft level\ndevelopment, TCM drifted directly into the T2 structure.\nAbundant visible gold associated with the striking green colour of the mineralized zone aided the visual identification and test mining\nof the T2 structure. Initial test mining continued north and south on-strike of the steeply east dipping structure to determine potential\nstrike lengths of the mineralized zone. At the same time, the original 609 exploration cross-cut was extended further eastward to test\nground immediately east of the T2 structure for further mineralization. Together with additional diamond drilling and exploration cross-\ncuts a broad zone of mineralized stockwork veining up to 25 m (80 ft) in width was identified, and this is referred to as the T4\nstockwork zone of mineralization.\nTCM Underground Development and Mineral Processing (2020 to 2021)\nIn November, 2020, the first shipment of mineralized material was shipped to an offsite processing facility and the first gold was\npoured by TCM. Continual underground development and drilling through 2021 helped define T2 mineralization over a 120 m (400 ft)\nstrike length and led to the recognition of the scale of the T4 stockwork mineralization. Design work for a surface portal and internal\ndecline ramp to access the Trixie underground development was commenced shortly thereafter. A geological model for T2-T4\nmineralization identified the potential significance of the overlying Ophir Shale as a cap above the Tintic Quartzite host rock in\ninfluencing the T2-T4 mineralized zone. In the fall of 2021, the Burgin processing facility was equipped with an onsite vat leaching\nprocess. On May 30, 2022, ODV announced the completion of its acquisition of TCM.\nGeological Setting and Mineralization\nGeological Setting\nThe Tintic Project is located within the historic Tintic mining district, a cluster of base and precious metal deposits covering more than\n200 square kilometres (km2) (or approximately 80 square miles) within the East Tintic Mountains of north-central UT. The district is\ncentred approximately 90 km (56 miles) south-southwest of Salt Lake City and 65 km (40 miles) south of the Bingham Canyon\nporphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposit. The East Tintic Mountains occupy a position within the Late Cretaceous Sevier fold and thrust belt\napproximately 30 km (20 miles) from the eastern limit of the Basin and Range extensional province, as defined by the surface\nexpression of the Wasatch fault. District mineralization is associated with a post-Sevier compression and pre-Basin and Range\nextension period of magmatism spanning ca. 27-35 Ma (latest Eocene to Oligocene). Commonly divided into Main, East, North and\nSouthwest subdistricts, the greater Tintic is collectively the second largest metal producing district in UT state, with Bingham first and\nPark City a close third. The core Tintic Project area covers more than 90% of known deposits within the East Tintic subdistrict.\nAdditional coverage extends north, west, and south into the North, Main and Southwest districts, respectively.\nDistrict Geology\nThe geology of the Tintic district can be summarized as the record of four (4) major phases of geologic evolution. These are 1)\ndevelopment of a Palaeozoic platformal sequence atop previously deformed Precambrian basement, 2) folding, faulting and uplift\naccommodating east-west shortening during Late Cretaceous Sevier Orogeny, 3) latest Eocene to Oligocene calc-alkaline\nmagmatism associated with district mineralization, and 4) Miocene to recent Basin and Range extension.\nAccommodation of east-west shortening during Late Cretaceous Sevier Orogeny resulted in the development of the district scale\nTintic syncline-East Tintic anticline fold pair, and several associated district-scale generally west-vergent thrusts. The geometry of the\nsub-horizontal roughly north-south trending fold pair is responsible for the general basement architecture of the Tintic district, wherein\nthe youngest (Mississippian) rocks of the Palaeozoic sequence are preserved along the trough of the Tintic syncline in the Main\ndistrict and the Tintic Quartzite is present at its highest structural levels along the crest of the East Tintic anticline in the East district.\nHigh-angle structures developed in relation to the Sevier orogeny include a system of predominantly northeast trending faults, with\nstrike-slip offset interpreted as accommodating differential displacement syn-compression, and a system of variably oriented normal\nfaults developed in accommodation of late to post-orogenic gravitational collapse.\nExtensive erosion following Sevier uplift resulted in the development of a rugged paleo-topography by the onset of district magmatism\nca. 35 Ma. The latest Eocene to Oligocene magmatic record consists of a quartz latite flow and tuff dominant\n104\nsequence of irregular thickness up to 1,500 m (5,000 ft) with cross cutting to coeval locally porphyritic monzonite to quartz monzonite\nintrusions of varying geometries. District mineralization, dated in the East Tintic at around 31 Ma, is contemporaneous and\nassociated. In the East Tintic district, known fissure-vein and replacement deposits are nearly exclusively buried beneath the irregular\nvolcanic cover. While the basal (pre-mineral) volcanic cover hosts no significant mineralization, it is commonly characterized by\nsignificant hydrothermal alteration. Several sub-km-scale lithocaps point to potential porphyry targets at depth, where more localized\nalteration along predominantly north to northeast-trending fissures with associated pebble dikes were used in successful targeting of\nmany of the known historic deposits.\nThe Palaeozoic sequence and its irregular volcanic cover are disrupted by Basin and Range extensional faulting. Miocene-age\nvolcanics likely mark the onset of extension in the district ca. 16-18 Ma. While any pre-existing fault structures are likely primed for\nsome degree of Basin and Range extensional reactivation, the most significant normal offsets occur along roughly north-south\ntrending structures, e.g., the district-scale Eureka Lilly fault. The variably north-south striking and west-dipping Eureka Lilly fault forms\na major aquitard through the East Tintic district, dividing a fresh, cool-water-table in its hanging-wall to the west from a hot and saline\nwater table in its footwall to the east. Post-lava offset on the Eureka Lilly fault is apparently variable along strike and may account for\nonly one-half (1/2) to a third (1/3) of the total offset across the structure, believed to have initiated during Late Sevier orogeny.\nDistrict Mineralization and Structure\nThe four (4) subdistricts of the Tintic are in part distinguishable in terms of their known mineral occurrences, hosted within the\ndeformed Palaeozoic sequence and, to a more limited extent, Oligocene monzonitic intrusions. The Main district is the most\nhistorically productive district by far, with characteristic carbonate-hosted lead-zinc-silver replacement deposits that form\npredominantly north to northeast-trending sub-horizontal zones rooted into subvertical chimney-like mineralized bodies rich in copper,\ngold and silver. Carbonate-replacement deposits with economic zinc ± lead ± silver are likewise present in the East district and the\nhistorically least-productive North district. The East district is unique in terms of the relative structural complexity of its deposits, and\nby the added presence of gold and silver-rich high-sulphidation fissure vein systems hosted within the brittle and unreactive Tintic\nQuartzite, such as at Trixie. The Southwest district is characterised by a relative dominance of igneous rocks, containing fissure\nsystems hosted within the Silver City stock and smaller associated monzonitic porphyry intrusions. The Southwest district is also host\nto the Southwest Tintic porphyry copper system, viewed as subeconomic, but with minor historical production from peripheral high-\nsulphidation, copper-silver-lead veins. Several key observations suggest the presence of additional and potentially economic porphyry\ncentres within the district. This includes indicator clay assemblages and elevated molybdenum and/or copper-lead ratios at the Big\nHill, Silver Pass, and Government Canyon lithocaps, all contained within the Tintic Project claims area.\nGeology, Structure and Mineralization at Trixie\nMineralization at the Trixie test mine is structurally controlled within a north-south-trending fissure-vein and breccia system developed\nwithin the brittle Tintic Quartzite. Gold and silver-rich mineralization within the so-called Trixie vein system is best classified as high-\nsulfidation epithermal (see discussion in Section 8). Current development at Trixie is focused within the footwall to the historically\nproductive steep-to-the-west-dipping 75-85 structure, targeting the subvertical-to-the-east-dipping T2 fissure vein, its hanging -wall T4\nbreccia zone, and a network of smaller-scale likewise north-south-trending mineralized fissures contained within it.\nSub-horizontal Palaeozoic strata exposed in underground at Trixie are believed to occupy a position within or proximal to the hinge\nzone of the East Tintic anticline, the nature of which may exert primary influence on the geometry, frequency, and distribution of grade\ncontrolling structures within the Trixie vein system. The stratigraphic contact between the Tintic Quartzite and overlying and\nimpermeable lower shale member of the Ophir Formation appears to have a major controlling influence on the development and\ndistribution grade and mineralization at Trixie. While controlling structures within the Trixie vein system do penetrate the younger\noverlying sequences, mineralization typically displays strong rheologic control and is restricted to the older and underlying brittlely\nfractured Tintic Quartzite host.\nThe main shaft of the historic Trixie mine was collared at approximately 1,852 m (6,075 ft) elevation into an outcropping window of\nMiddle Cambrian Teutonic Limestone. The shaft passes through the full thickness of the Ophir Formation to reach the Tintic Quartzite\nat a depth of approximately 125 m (410 ft). All current development stems off the historic 625-foot mine level, deeper historic workings\ninclude 750, 900, 1050, 1200 and 1350-foot levels. The full extent of both modern and\n105\nhistoric development at Trixie resides within the hanging-wall to the district-scale Eureka Lilly fault. The fresh groundwater table of the\nEureka Lilly hanging-wall at Trixie sits below the ca. 1,437 m (4,716 ft) elevation of the 1350-foot level, around 425 m below surface.\nThe Late Eocene to Oligocene Packard Quartz Latite unconformably overlies the Palaeozoic Tintic-Ophir-Teutonic sequence in nearly\nevery direction surrounding the Trixie main shaft. The Packard Quartz Latite is in local unconformable contact with both the Ophir\nFormation and Tintic Quartzite, reaching thicknesses up to 380 m (1,250 ft) directly south of the ventilation shaft.\nThe core of the Trixie vein system occupies a high-seated position within an east-west oriented horst, the bounding structures of\nwhich may have served as critical pathways for mineralizing fluids. North of the Trixie main shaft, the Tintic Quartzite is down-dropped\nan estimated 198 m (650 ft) across the east-west-trending sub-vertically north-dipping Trixie fault zone. At the very northern limits of\ndevelopment, the sequence is again offset relatively down to the north across the Eureka Standard fault zone, which appears to\nconsist locally of at least two major east-northeast trending splays. Though not fully constrained, relative stratigraphic offset across\nthe Eureka Standard fault zone is of similar or greater magnitude to that observed across the Trixie Fault zone. Approaching the\nsouthern end of development, the Tintic Quartzite and mineralized structures of the Trixie vein system appear to be offset across the\npresumably steep to the south-dipping Sioux-Ajax fault zone. The Sioux-Ajax fault zone has not been intersected by any modern-day\ndevelopment. Constraining its displacement and orientation is complicated by several intersecting west-dipping splays of the Eureka\nLilly fault that appear to further offset the mineralization.\nThe Sioux-Ajax fault system is well-known within the Main District as a major ore controlling structure, with associated breccias\nhosting large replacement bodies in both the Mammoth and Iron Blossom mines. The Sioux-Ajax fault system of the Main district\nconsists locally of two (2) or more splays, generally striking east-southeast and dipping steeply to the north. The fault system is buried\nbeneath volcanic cover projecting along strike into the East Tintic district, wherein its correlation and relationships with known\nstructures have long been a topic of high interest and debate. Recent interpretations based on the integration of historical mapping\nwith high-resolution magnetic data acquired in 2019 suggest that the Trixie, Eureka Standard, and south-dipping Sioux Ajax fault\nzones, as defined within the Trixie development area, are structurally linked with the Sioux Ajax zone of the Main district and may\nhave collectively provided the deep-seated plumbing necessary for mineralization at Trixie.\nThe historic 756 ore shoot at the north end of Trixie development displays a steep northerly plunge in the footwall to the Trixie fault\nzone. At the southern end of Trixie development, higher grade ore shoots within the historically mined 75-85 zone exhibit a steep\nsoutherly plunge for which the presumed south-dipping Sioux Ajax fault zone is the interpreted structural control. These historical\nobservations suggest that mineralization and grade within the T2 fissure vein and T4 zone currently in development in the immediate\nfootwall to the 75-85 structure may be characterized by a similar geometry.\nExploration Programs\nUnderground Exploration\nExploration work undertaken at the Tintic Project in 2022 consisted of coordinated underground mapping and sampling programs\ncovering both new exploration drifts and development along and across the mineralization underground at Trixie. Post-advancement\nface, rib and back chip-sampling, and post-survey three-dimensional underground back and rib geologic mapping were conducted by\nthe geological team.\nFrom January through December 12, 2022, a total of 2,115 samples from 547 individual chip sample sequences were collected\nacross a number of different test mining and exploration development areas underground at Trixie.\nNo surface regional-scale mapping or sampling programs were conducted in 2022.\nMicon’s QP discussed the Trixie sampling practices and procedures with Project personnel as well as observing the underground face\nchip sampling during a site visit conducted in September 2022. Micon’s QP believes that the Trixie sampling practices and procedures\nare managed according to the Exploration Best Practice Guidelines established by the CIM. Micon’s QP also believes that the\nsamples derived from the underground chip sampling practices are appropriately taken, recorded and located to be able to be used\nas part of the underlying data for a mineral resource estimate.\n106\nExploration Drilling Programs\nSurface RC Drilling\nSurface reverse circulation (RC) drilling of the Trixie Deposit (T1, T2, T3, T4, and 75-85 mineralized zones) commenced in July, 2022\nand a total of 6,937.25 m (22,760 ft) of RC drilling in 21 drill holes were completed by early December, 2022 when the program\nterminated.\nAssay results from 8 RC drillholes from the 2022 RC surface drilling program have been received and incorporated into the Tintic\nTechnical Report. A total of four (4) of the surface RC drill holes had no significant assays and one-hole, TRC053, was abandoned.\nSee Table 12 below for Surface RC Drilling Assay highlights.\nTable 12: 2022 Surface RC Drilling Assay Highlights\nHole Number Depth From (ft) Depth To (ft) Length (ft) Au (ppm) Ag (ppm)\nTRC040 605.00 615.00 10.00 0.07 103.85\nTRC048 1,095.00 1,100.00 5.00 0.32 88.00\nTRC048 1,305.00 1,310.00 5.00 0.23 74.60\nTRC052 515.00 530.00 15.00 0.66 29.33\nUnderground Diamond Drilling\nThe 2022 underground diamond drilling program on the Trixie Deposit (T1, T2, T3, T4, and 75-85 mineralized zones) recommenced\non April 1, 2022 and by December 19, 2022, 1,966.57 m (6,452 ft) of drilling was completed on the Trixie Deposit in 46 drill holes.\n107\nAssay results from 14 underground diamond drill hole mineralized intersections were returned.

Although recovery in the diamond drilling program averages a reasonable 90.1%, the core suffers significant destruction during\nthe drilling process resulting in difficult interpretations of significant mineralized structures, and increased uncertainty in the rock\nquality designation and recovery data. Broken ground, significant faulting, and hard abrasive lithologies have resulted in slow sample\nproduction and further compromised the structural interpretation. Average RC production of 27.4 m (90 ft) per day and diamond drill\nproduction of 9.4 m (31 ft) per day were typical of the 2022 program. In addition, the lack of structural data made true-width\nrelationships difficult to determine from the drilling.\nDue to the issues with the drilling, the historical and current underground development have been the primary sources of information\nregarding the nature, orientation and extent of the mineralization at Trixie for the initial mineral resource estimate.\nSlow turn-around times of 60 to 90 days at the assay laboratories have resulted in a significant lack of assay data and have prevented\nthe inclusion of many diamond drill and RC holes in the initial mineral resource estimate.\nConclusions\nMicon’s QP reviewed the drilling and sampling procedures at Trixie during a site visit and in further discussions with ODV personnel.\nMicon’s QP believes that despite the challenges encountered during the Trixie drilling programs, the drilling and sampling procedures\nhave been and are being conducted with industry best practices in mind, such as those outlined by\n108\nCIM. Therefore, the drilling can be appropriately included as part of the database which serves as the basis for the current and future\nmineral resource estimates.\nSampling, Analysis and Data Verification\nThe following section describes the preparation, analysis and security procedures used for all underground face chip and drill core\nsamples collected during 2022 at the Trixie test mine which are used in the current resource estimate. Samples collected prior to\n2022 and which are included in the current resource estimate were validated by Dr. Thomas A. Henricksen QP, C.P.G. and are\nconsidered to meet generally accepted industry standards for sample preparation, analysis, QA/QC and security protocols. The QP\nhas reviewed the material related to the samples validated by Dr. Henricksen and believes that they meet generally accepted industry\nstandards, as outlined by CIM, and are therefore suitable to be used as the basis for a mineral resource estimate.\nSample Handling and Security\nSample handling and security procedures are managed by TCM personnel. These procedures are described in detail below.\nUnderground Chip Sampling\nAll underground chip samples are collected by TCM mine geologists from each of the active faces during each shift, as required. Chip\nsamples are collected and do not exceed 0.91 m (3 ft) in length. The face is washed for safety, and for better identification of\nmineralization, alteration and structures. The hangingwall and footwall of the structures are marked on the face and back. Sample\nintervals are marked up and follow lithological contacts. Samples are transported by the geologist from the Trixie test mine to the\nonsite Tintic laboratory at the Burgin administrative complex.\nDrill Core Sampling\nFollowing extraction from the core tube, underground diamond drill core is placed in wax-impregnated core boxes with depths marked\nby wooden marking blocks. The boxes are labelled with the drill hole number, the box number, and the depth interval, then lidded and\ntaped shut. Boxes are brought to surface daily by miners and picked up by TCM logging geologists and geotechnicians and delivered\nto the TCM logging facility.\nAt the core logging facility, drill core is marked with footage depths then recovery and rock quality are measured and recorded.\nGeologic and geotechnical information is logged and input into Datamine’s DHLogger software and synchronized to a central\ndatabase. Sample intervals are marked with aluminum tags and unique sample identification numbers, and input into DHLogger, as\nwell. Drill core is then photographed and sent to the core cutting facility.\nTCM core cutters half-cut the drill core using an Almonte Automated Core Saw. Half the core is placed back in the core box and the\nother half is placed in a calico or plastic sample bag, labelled with the corresponding sample identification number. Boxes of half-cut\ncore are palleted and moved to core storage. Sample bags are moved to a staging area for dispatch to an analytical laboratory.\nDuring staging for dispatch, standard and blank samples are inserted into the sample sequence for QA/QC. Bagged samples are then\nplaced in rice bags in groups of five (5) to ten (10) samples, depending on weight. Rice bags are labelled with a unique shipment ID\nand sequential numbering (eg: Bag 1, Bag 2) A sample list and sample submittal form are inserted into the first bag for each\nshipment, then bags are sealed with metal ties, loaded on pallets, and secured using clear shrink wrap. All samples are shipped to\nALS Analytical Laboratories via Old Dominion Shipping. Copies of a manifest and chain of custody form are given to TCM and Old\nDominion.\nReverse Circulation Drill Chip Sampling\nDuring the RC drilling process, rock chips are lifted to surface with air and water pressure. Chips are run through a cyclone\nattachment on the drill tower, fitted with splitters which cause a 1:2 split of the chips. At five (5)-foot intervals, a third (1/3) of the chips\nis separated into cloth filter bags for sampling, while two thirds (2/3) are separated in polyethylene bags for storage as reject material.\nOnce per five (5)-foot interval, a coarse mesh sieve is inserted into the reject outflow from the cyclone to collect a small,\nrepresentative chip sample. This sample is placed in chip sample trays for logging. Once per fifty-\n109\nfoot interval, an additional splitter is added to the cyclone to divide the sampled chips into a sample and a duplicate for QA/QC\npurposes. Any water overflow from the cyclone outflow is caught with a -80-mesh sieve to prevent the loss of fine material. Bags are\nsealed and laid out to dry on the drill pad.\nSample bags and chip trays are collected from the drill pad by TCM logging geologists and geotechnicians and delivered to the TCM\nlogging facility. Geologic information is logged into Datamine’s DHLogger software and synchronized to a central database. Chip trays\nare then photographed.\nDuring staging for dispatch, standard and blank samples are inserted into the sample sequence for QA/QC. Samples are then placed\nin rice bags in groups of five (5) to ten (10) samples depending on weight. Rice bags are labelled with a unique shipment ID and\nsequential numbering (eg. Bag 1, Bag 2). A sample list and sample submittal form are inserted into the first bag for each shipment,\nthen bags are sealed with metal ties, loaded on pallets, and secured using clear shrink wrap. All samples are shipped to ALS\nAnalytical Laboratories via Old Dominion Shipping. Copies of a manifest and chain of custody form are given to TCM and Old\nDominion.\nSample Preparation and Assaying\nALS Sample Preparation\nThe following outlines ALS laboratories sample preparation procedures:\n● Samples are sorted and logged into the ALS LIMS program.\n● Samples are dried and weighed.\n● Samples are crushed to +70% passing 2 mm (CRU-31).\n● The crushed sample split of up to 500 g is pulverized to +85% passing 75 μm screen (PUL 32m).\n● Once analysis is complete, pulp material is returned to TCM for storage and coarse rejects are disposed of after 90 days.\nALS Gold Assaying\nThe following outlines ALS laboratories assay procedures used on the Trixie mineralization:\n● A 50-g pulp aliquot is analyzed by Au-AA26: fire assay followed by aqua regia digestion (HNO3-HCl) with an atomic\nabsorption spectroscopy finish (“AAS”).\n● When assay results are higher than 100 g/t Au, a second 50-g pulp aliquot is analysed by Au-GRA22: fire assay, parting with\nnitric acid (HNO3) with a gravimetric finish.\n● Selected samples were analyzed by metallic screen. The +100 μm fraction (Au+) is analyzed in its entirety by FA with\ngravimetric finish. The 100 μm fraction (minus) is homogenized and two (2) subsamples are analyzed by FA with AAS (Au-\nAA25) or gravimetric finish (Au-GRA21). The average of the two (2) minus fraction subsamples are taken and reported as the\nAu- fraction result. The gold content is then determined by the weighted average of the Au+ and Au- fractions.\nALS Multi-Element Assaying\nThe following outlines ALS Laboratories assay procedures used for multi-element assaying:\n● Some samples are analyzed by trace-level multi-element method ME-MS61: a 0.25-g aliquot is digested by four-acid\ndigestion (HNO3-HClO4-HF-HCl) and HCl leach (method GEO-4A01) and analyzed by ICP-AES.\n110\n● Following this analysis, the results are reviewed for high concentrations of bismuth, mercury, molybdenum, silver and\ntungsten and diluted accordingly. Samples meeting these criteria are then analyzed by ICP-MS. Results are corrected for\nspectral interelement interferences.\nTintic Laboratory Preparation\nThe Tintic laboratory sample preparation procedures are outlined as follows:\n● The samples are loaded into a drying oven to remove any moisture\n● After drying the sample order is confirmed on the submittal form. Any discrepancies are brought to the geology group’s\nattention and resolved.\n● Each sample is prepared using a belt elevator feeding into a jaw crusher, then directly into a gyratory crusher reducing\nsample particle size to approximately 3.5 mm.\n● The sample is then introduced to a rotary splitter to reduce volume and maintain representation of the entire sample. The\nrotary table has 12 paired pans of which will be selected randomly until an approximate 2,000-gram split is available for\npulverizing.\n● Pulverizing is achieved by feeding the selected sample split into a vibratory feeder that feeds a disc pulverizer.\n● The finely ground sample is then introduced to a small jones splitter and further reduced to approximately 250-grams and\ninserted into a sample packet ready for assaying.\nTintic Laboratory Gold and Silver Assaying\nThe following outlines Tintic Laboratory assay procedures:\n● Each prepared sample packet is forwarded to the fire assay laboratory where a routine one (1) assay ton assay is performed.\nThis assay uses lead as a collector for any precious metals in the fusion step and then oxidizes the lead using a cupel\n(magnesia cup) to separate the precious metals from the lead.\n● The remaining “bead” of precious metals is referred to as a Dore bead. The Assayer will tap each Dore with a hammer to\nremove any residual cupel and then place the bead in a ceramic cup.\n● The dore beads are then forwarded to the Balance room where each Dore is weighed using a micro-balance and recording\nthe weight.\n● A 25% from concentrate volume of nitric acid is added to each ceramic cup containing a dore bead and placed on a hotplate.\nThe nitric acid dissolves silver leaving only the gold as a solid.\n● The solution is decanted from the cup, the cup and gold are rinsed with deionized water, and then returned to the hotplate to\ndry. The dry cup and gold are annealed and after cooling the gold is weighed on the micro-balance and weight recorded.\nQuality Assurance and Quality Control\nA total of 2,030 drill core and RC chip samples (including QA/QC samples) were assayed in 2022 at ALS. The 2022 QA/QC program\nincluded a routine insertion of standards and blanks. TCM included one (1) standard in every 20 samples and one (1) blank in every\n30 samples.\nA total of 2,851 chip samples (including QA/QC samples) were assayed in 2022 at the Tintic laboratory. The 2022 QA/QC program\nincluded a routine insertion of standards and blanks. TCM included one standard in every ten (10) samples and one (1) blank in every\n20 samples.\n111\nAccuracy is monitored by adding standards at the rate of one Certified Reference Material (CRM) or Standard for every 20 samples.\nStandards are used to detect assay problems with specific sample batches and any possible long-term biases in the overall dataset.\nTCM’s definition of a quality control failure is when:\n● Assays for a CRM are outside ±three standard deviations (±3SD) or ±10%.\n● Assays for two (2) consecutive CRMs are outside ±2SD, if one (1) of them is outside ±3SD.\nConclusions\nMicon’s QP has reviewed and had extensive discussions with the Corporation’s personnel regarding QA/QC program at the Tintic\nProject and has reviewed the results of the Tintic laboratory audit by Qualitica Consulting. Micon’s QP also toured the Tintic laboratory\nduring the September, 2022 site visit. During the discussions all aspects of the QA/QC program, results and recommendations of the\nTintic laboratory audit as well as potential additions to the QA/QC programs were discussed.\nBased on the QA/QC results from ALS, and the favourable audit of the Tintic laboratory, it is the opinion of Micon’s QP that the assay\ndatabase for the Trixie deposit is of suitable quality to be used in the estimate of resources and as the basis for further work.\nData Verification\nIn order to undertake the review and validation of the initial mineral resource estimate for the Trixie deposit within the Tintic Project,\nthe QPs of the Tintic Technical Report undertook a number of discussions and meetings with ODV’s personnel and contractors to\ndiscuss details relevant to the exploration programs, QA/QC programs, parameters used for the mineral resource estimate and the\nmineral resource estimate itself. The discussions were held via email chains and phone calls, and Microsoft Teams and Zoom\nmeetings, as well as during the site visit. At all times the discussions were open, frank and at no time was information withheld or not\navailable to the QPs. Open and frank discussions continued throughout mineral resource validation in December, 2022 and January,\n2023 on all aspects of the process, and this culminated in the completion of the initial mineral resource estimate.\nThe geologic modelling for the Trixie deposit was completed by ODV senior production geologist Courtney Kurtz, P.G. using Leapfrog\nGeo software. The MRE was completed by ODV chief resource geologist, Daniel Downton, P.Geo., using Datamine Studio RM Pro\n1.12 software. The MRE was then reviewed and validated by William Lewis, P.Geo. and Alan San Martin, AusIMM(CP) of Micon.\nA site visit was conducted from September 12 to September 16, 2022 by Mr. Lewis to independently verify the geology, mineralogy,\ndrilling programs and the QA/QC programs at the Tintic Project.\nThe presence of grade variability is not a hindrance to producing a reliable resource estimate for a mineral deposit. The first step is to\nrecognize the variability and then to apply appropriate procedures and methodologies to minimize any over estimation of the resource\ngrade. Micon’s QP believes that despite the demonstrated grade variability within the Trixie deposit, ODV has used appropriate\nprocedures within its estimation methodology to limit over estimation of the grade and, consequently skewing the metal content within\nthe deposit.\nWhile the reproducibility of a number of samples clearly indicates the variability of the grade within the mineral zones that comprise\nthe Trixie deposit, Micon’s QPs believe that the database generated for the Trixie deposit is adequate for use as the basis of a mineral\nresource estimate. The database is also sufficiently reliable to be used as the basis for further work and upon which to conduct further\neconomic studies.\nMetallurgical Testwork\nSample Provenance\nTwo (2) bulk metallurgical composite samples were prepared by ODV from mineralization obtained during the exploration test mining\nperformed during 2021 and early 2022.\n112\nThe first bulk composite (T2 Soil Sample) was prepared from laboratory high grade coarse reject samples over an 8-month period\nfrom April to December 2021. This 477.5 kg sample was selected to be representative of a T2/T4 high grade run of mine (ROM)\nmaterial leached in the TCM pilot vat leach facility (VLF) during 2021 and 2022.\nThe second composite sample (T4 Soil Sample) was prepared using four (4) sample increments at various mine accessible points of\nthe T4 structure. This 171 kg sample selected to be representative of the bulk T4 structure at the 625 level.\nMetallurgical Testwork\nThe metallurgical testing was undertaken by Kappes, Cassiday & Associates, Reno, Nevada and included the following primary\ntestwork:\n● Multi-element analysis of the samples.\n● Diagnostic leaching.\n● Gold deportment mineralogy (AMTEL).\n● Bulk mineralogy (FLSmidth).\n● Bottle roll leach testing at various particle sizes.\n● Gravity separations tests.\n● Comminution testwork (Hazen Research).\nSample Characterization\nThe head grades of the two (2) samples were 64.1 g/t Au and 102 g/t Ag for T2, and 8.8 g/t Au and 14.5 g/t Ag T4.\nBoth samples are characterized by high silica content (92% to 96%) and low sulphide sulphur content, typically less than 0.2% S2-.\nCopper in the T2 sample measured about 750 g/t, but only about half of this was readily cyanide soluble.\nDiagnostic leach tests using samples of the two (2) composites ground to 80% passing 74 microns indicated that approximately 99%\nof the gold in sample T2 and 88% in sample T4, is directly soluble. Mineralogical gold deportment studies showed that 99% of the\ngold in sample T2 was exposed and potentially cyanide soluble while T4 material showed that 81% of the gold was free gold with\nhessite and telluride associations of 7% and 10% respectively. The gold grains identified in sample T2 tended to be larger than those\nin T4.\nComminution tests showed that both samples were relatively hard and abrasive. Bond ball mill work indices of 18.2 kWh/t and 19.0\nkWh/t were calculated for T2 and T4, respectively.\nDeleterious elements often encountered in gold mineral resources are present in low concentrations in both these samples. Mercury\nis <3 ppm, selenium was analyzed at or below 5 ppm, and arsenic was 176 g/t on average for T2 and 29 g/t for the T4 sample. The\nT2 high grade structure sample did show relatively higher concentrations of these deleterious elements than the T4 material. The\nsulphide sulphur content was relatively low for both samples and therefore, it is unlikely that the mineralization will be acid generating.\nTestwork Results\nBottle roll cyanide leach tests gave results of up to 99% Au and 88% Ag extraction after 72 hours for sample T2. The corresponding\nbest T4 tests achieved 98% Au and 84% Ag extraction.\nGravity separation tests using sample T2 suggested that approximately about 40% gold can be recovered by gravity separation.\n113\nInitial Trixie Mineral Resource Estimate\nIntroduction\nThe initial Mineral Resource Estimate for the Trixie Test Mine (the “Initial MRE”), was conducted in December, 2022 and January,\n2023 and encompasses initial resources for the Trixie deposit.\nMethodology\nThe mineral resource area for the Trixie deposit covers a strike length of approximately 445 m down to a vertical depth of\napproximately 295 m below surface.\nThe wireframe models for the Trixie deposit were prepared using LeapFrog GEO v.2022.1 (“LeapFrog”). Wireframe modelling\nincluded the construction of five (5) mineralized domains constrained to the extents of the regional-scale Tintic Quartzite lithologic unit\nand capped by shale belonging to the overlying lower member of the Ophir Formation. Geostatistical analyses were carried out using\nDatamine Snowden Supervisor v.8.15.0.1 (“Supervisor”). The estimation, block model and grade interpolation, was prepared using\nDatamine StudioTM RM Pro v.1.12.113.0 (“Datamine”). Resource-level potentially mineable underground shapes were created using\nthe Deswik CAD v.2021.2.748 Shape Optimizer module (“DSO”).\nResource Database\nThe close-out date for the Trixie deposit Initial MRE database is December 12, 2022. It consists of 42 validated diamond drill holes,\ntotalling 2,358.45 m of core and comprised of 1,802 sample intervals. The database also includes eight (8)-validated RC drill holes,\ntotalling 2,421.64 m of RC drilling and comprises 987 sample intervals, and 1,019 underground chip sample strings comprised of\n4,467 sample intervals assayed for gold (“Au”) and silver (“Ag”).\nThe database includes validated location, survey, and assay results. It also includes lithological descriptions taken from drill core logs.\nThe database covers the strike length of each mineralized domain at variable drill hole and chip sample spacings, ranging between\n1.5 to 50 m.\nIn addition to the tables of raw data, each database includes several tables of calculated drill hole composites and wireframe solid\nintersections, which are required for the statistical evaluation and mineral resource block modelling.\nGeological Model\nThe geological model of the Trixie deposit was prepared in LeapFrog, using underground mapping, chip samples, RC drill holes, and\nvalidated diamond drill holes, all completed by December 12, 2022.\nA total of five (5) mineralized domains, were modelled with each domain restricted up dip by its contact with the lower shale member\nof the Ophir Formation, as this contact acts as an impermeable cap to mineralizing fluids.\nThe domains modelled were the T1, T2, T3, T4 and the 75-85. In addition, a north-south trending sub-vertically dipping fault structure\nhas been mapped across multiple underground development headings near the 625 level and has been intercepted in multiple drill\nholes. Though the full extent of the structure is at present unknown, it is currently inferred to project through the entirety of the model.\nAs underground mapping indicates a minor offset of the T2 structure across this fault, it is used as a hard boundary for geological\nmodelling and grade interpolation. The model is thus split into east and west fault blocks, with each mineralized domain subdivided\ninto respective east and west subdomains.\n114\nGeostatistical Analysis\nCompositing\nMost of the analytical samples were collected with lengths between 0.31 and 1.52 m. A modal composite length of approximately 0.61\nm was applied to domains T2 and T3, generating composites as close to 0.61 m as possible, while creating residual intervals with a\nminimum length of 0.06 m. A modal composite length of 0.91 m was applied to all other domains. In all cases, composite files were\nderived from raw values within the modelled resource domains.\nHigh grade Capping\nMultiple capping (different capping at different ranges in each domain) was selected as the capping methodology for high grade\noutlier gold and silver assays at the Trixie deposit. After considering reconciliation results and geological continuity, the T2 domain\nuses a single capping level for gold. The top capping thresholds were selected based on the probability plots and vary from 20.0 g/t to\n1,350.0 g/t Au and 200.0 g/t to 2,500.0 g/t Ag.\nThe maximum range for high-grade continuity was established using the indicator variograms, which suggests a loss of continuity\nafter 4.5 m to 9.0 m, depending on the mineralized domain. A range of 7.6 m was selected and applied to all zones as a general\naverage search range for the first pass grade top cut interpolation.\nDensity\nThe density databases contain 512 measurements taken on samples across multiple geologic domains.\nAverage bulk density values in the mineralized domains were assigned to the T1 (2.616 t/m3), T2 (2.955 t/m3), T3 (2.638 t/m3), T4\n(2.621 t/m3), and 75-85 (2.617 t/m3) domains.\nA density of 0.00 t/m3 was assigned to the underground development from all past mining activities.\nBulk densities were used to calculate tonnages from the volume estimates in the block model.\nVariogram Analysis\nThe spatial distribution of gold and silver was evaluated through variogram analysis and spherical variograms were modelled for each\nof the mineralized domains.\nAll variogram analyses and modelling were performed in “Supervisor”. Primary directions and orientations of the variograms were\nobserved in the data and visually in 3D space. These orientations were then examined statistically within the software package to\nensure they represented the best possible fit of the geology and grade continuity.\nSearch Parameters\nFor the T2, T3 and 75-85 domains, the 3D directional-specific search ellipses were guided by the local structural orientation of the\ndomain for an anisotropic search. For the T1 and T4 domains 3D directional-specific search ellipses were guided by the Au and Ag\ngrade variograms. The search radii were influenced and determined by both the grade and indicator variograms.\nGrade distributions and kriging neighbourhood analyses (“KNA”) were used to help guide the number of composites to use for the\ngrade interpolations.\nSearch neighbourhoods used different capping levels as determined through the threshold analyses.\nBlock Model and Grade Interpretation\nThe criteria used in the selection of block size include drill hole spacing, composite length, the geometry of the modelled zone, and\nthe anticipated mining methods. A block size of 1.22 m x 1.22 m x 1.83 m was used. Sub-cells were used, allowing\n115\na resolution of 0.30 m x 0.30 m x 0.30 m to better reflect the shape of the mineralization domains. Sub-cells were assigned the same\nvalues as their parent cell. No rotation was applied to the block model.\nFour (4) search passes were used for the grade interpolation and each one utilized a capped grade from the multiple capping levels\ndetermined through threshold analyses. A series of sensitivity runs were performed to examine the impact of various parameters on\nthe estimation. Parameters were selected, and gold and silver were estimated using inverse distance squared (“ID2”). Each\nsubsequent estimation pass used increasing search neighbourhood sizes, determined from grade and indicator variogram results.\nSamples from a minimum of two (2) drill holes or chip strings were required to estimate all blocks.\nModel Validation\nMineralized domain models were validated using a variety of methods including visual inspection of the model grades, grade\ndistributions compared to the informing raw samples, statistical comparisons of informing composites to the model for local and global\nbias, and reconciliation comparing the model to observed grades from underground development.\nAll analyses indicate that the model follows the grade distribution of the informing composites and that the accuracy of the model has\nbeen demonstrated. The total global comparison for each resource classification is within a 20% tolerance for bias and reconciliation.\nThe Micon QPs consider that the model is valid and is a reasonable representation of the Trixie mineralization, based on the current\nlevel of sampling and geological information.\nMineral Resource Classification\nMineral Resource Classification was determined through geometric criteria deemed reasonable for the deposit.\nDue to the lack of sample data that fully crosscut the T1 and 75-85 domains, no material has been classified as measured for these\ndomains, and the characteristics used to classify indicated material have tighter constraints.\nDue to the geological nature of the stockwork structures in the T4 domain, there is a degree of uncertainty in the ranges of the high-\ngrade mineralization. Therefore, no material has been classified as measured in that domain.\nBlocks estimated within the mineralized domains not meeting the criteria to classify them as either measured, indicated or inferred\nwere not classified and are not part of the mineral resource estimate.\nReasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction\nA reasonable economic cut-off grade for resource evaluation at the Trixie deposit was determined using the parameters presented in\nTable 14. The QPs consider the selected cut-off grade of 4.85 g/t Au to be appropriate based on the current knowledge of the Project.\nTable 14: Resource Cut-Off Grade Parameters\nParameters Values (USD)\nMining Cost ($/ST) $ 60.00\nG&A ($/ST) $ 64.97\nHaulage ($/ST) $ 10.00\nMilling ($/ST) $ 89.00\nTotal Refining Cost ($/oz) $ 2.65\nGold Price ($/oz) $ 1,750\nRoyalty (Combination) 4.50%\nMill Recovery 95.0%\nCOG - Round up to (0.05 g/T) 4.85\n116\nThe Deswik Stope Optimizer (“DSO”) was used to demonstrate spatial continuity of the mineralized zones within “potentially mineable\nshapes.” The DSO parameters used a minimum mining shape of 6.1 m along the strike of the deposit, a height of 6.1 m and a\nminimum width of 1.5 m. The maximum shape measures 6.1 m x 6.1 m x 12.2 m in width. Only those blocks of the model constrained\nby the resulting conceptual mineable shapes are reported as resources.\nIn the opinion of the QPs, the use of the conceptual mining shapes as constraints to report Mineral Resource Estimates demonstrate\nthat the reported resources meet the criteria defined in the CIM Definition Standards (2014), and the MRMR Best Practice Guidelines\n(2019) for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction.\nThe economics of the resources were evaluated solely on the gold content within the mineralized domains. By product silver\nresources reported are contained in those resource blocks that have potential economic viability based only on the contained gold.\nMined Void Depletion\nAll current underground development at the Trixie deposit has been conducted by TCM and the void solids for this development have\nbeen surveyed, modelled, and kept up to date by TCM. The historically mined development at Trixie has been modelled by TCM, but\nto reduce the associated risk of uncertainty in void locations, a buffer solid of 6.1 m (20 ft) was developed around the historical\nshapes. The historical buffers and the current development voids are used to deplete the final mineral resource of the Trixie deposit.\nAs underground diamond drilling continues to intersect historically mined voids, the void shapes will be refined, reducing the\nuncertainty, and the depletion buffers may be reduced.\nTrixie Initial Mineral Resource Estimate Statement\nThe QPs have classified the Initial MRE as Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources based on data density, search\nellipse criteria, and interpolation parameters. The Initial MRE is considered a reasonable representation of the mineral resources of\nthe Trixie deposit based on the current quality data and geological knowledge. The Mineral Resource Estimate follows the 2014 CIM\nDefinition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves.\nTable 15 displays the results of the Initial MRE at the official 4.85 g/t Au cut-off grade for the Trixie deposit.\nMineral Resource Grade Sensitivity Analysis\nTable 16 shows the cut-off grade sensitivity analysis of gold and silver for the Initial MRE. Prospective investors should be cautioned\nthat the figures provided in Table 16 should not be interpreted as a mineral resource statement. The reported quantities and grade\nestimates at different cut-off grades are presented for the sole purpose of demonstrating the sensitivity of the mineral resource model\nfor gold to the selection of a reporting cut-off grades used in the sensitivity analysis, and it is the opinion of the QP that they meet the\ntest for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction at varying prices of gold or other underlying parameters used to\ncalculate the cut-off grade.\nTable 15: Trixie Deposit Initial Mineral Resource Estimate Statement\nCut-Off Contained Contained\nGrade Quantity Grade Gold Metal Grade Silver Metal\nClassification Gold (g/t) (‘000 t) (g/t) Gold (‘000 oz) (g/t) Silver (‘000 oz)\nMeasured 4.85 11 190.61 67 195.53 69\nIndicated 4.85 225 20.17 146 43.73 316\nTotal Measured + Indicated 4.85 236 28.08 213 50.77 385\nInferred 4.85 385 19.64 243 42.82 530\nNotes:\n(1) Effective date of the Initial MRE is January 10, 2023.\n117\n(2) Mr. William Lewis P.Geo, of Micon International Limited and Alan S J San Martin, AusIMM(CP), of Micon International Limited\nhave reviewed and validated the Initial MRE, and are independent “Qualified Persons” as defined in NI 43-101. They are\nresponsible for the Initial MRE.\n(3) The mineral resources disclosed in this report were estimated using the CIM standards on mineral resources and reserves\ndefinitions, and guidelines prepared by the CIM standing committee on reserve definitions and adopted by the CIM council.\n(4) Mineral Resources are reported when they are within potentially mineable shapes derived from a stope optimizer algorithm,\nassuming an underground longhole stoping mining method with stopes of 6.1 m x 6.1 m x minimum 1.5 m dimensions.\n(5) Mineral Resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n(6) Geologic modelling was completed by ODV senior production geologist Courtney Kurtz, P.G. of Utah, USA using Leapfrog Geo\nsoftware. The Initial MRE was completed by ODV’s chief resource geologist, Daniel Downton, P.Geo using Datamine Studio RM\nPro 1.12 software. The Initial MRE was reviewed and verified by of William Lewis and Alan San Martin of Micon.\n(7) The estimate is reported for an underground mining scenario and with reasonable assumptions. The cut-off grade of 4.85 g/t Au\nwas calculated using a gold price of US$1,750/oz, a CAD: USD exchange rate of 1.3; total mining, processing and G&A costs of\nUS$226.62/US ton a combined royalty of 4.5% and an average metallurgical recovery of 95%.\n(8) Average bulk density values in the mineralized domains were assigned to the T1 (2.616 t/m3), T2 (2.955 t/m3), T3 (2.638 t/m3),\nT4 (2.621 t/m3), and 75-85 (2.617 t/m3) domains.\n(9) Inverse Distance Squared interpolation method was used with a parent block size of 1.2 m x 1.2 m x 1.8 m.\n(10)The Initial MRE results are presented in-situ. Estimations used metric units (metres, tonnes, g/t). The number of tonnes is\nrounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.\n(11)Neither ODV nor Micon International Limited is aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-\npolitical, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate other than disclosed in the\nTintic Technical Report.\n118\nTable 16: Gold Grade Sensitivity Analysis at Different Cut-Off Grades\nClassification Tonnes COG AU (g/t) Au (oz) Ag (g/t) Ag (oz)\nMeasured + Indicated 334,672 2.50 20.83 224,173 42.82 460,779\n319,822 2.75 21.68 222,896 43.86 450,953\n307,608 3.00 22.42 221,774 44.89 443,994\n294,982 3.25 23.24 220,417 45.69 433,314\n282,778 3.50 24.10 219,084 46.57 423,392\n271,397 3.75 24.95 217,747 47.52 414,665\n262,447 4.00 25.68 216,661 48.36 408,078\n254,538 4.25 26.33 215,513 48.89 400,102\n246,598 4.50 27.05 214,455 49.84 395,124\n238,470 4.75 27.82 213,323 50.58 387,785\n235,808 4.85 28.08 212,878 50.77 384,932\n233,051 5.00 28.35 212,436 51.15 383,279\n225,992 5.25 29.08 211,256 51.93 377,298\n219,345 5.50 29.79 210,054 52.66 371,399\n214,337 5.75 30.34 209,096 53.33 367,482\n209,391 6.00 30.92 208,184 53.92 363,007\n203,529 6.25 31.63 206,977 54.79 358,517\n198,274 6.50 32.30 205,914 55.54 354,071\n193,801 6.75 32.88 204,845 56.11 349,585\n189,341 7.00 33.50 203,919 56.92 346,468\n185,742 7.25 34.00 203,058 57.34 342,437\n181,989 7.50 34.55 202,159 57.85 338,499\nInferred 553,279 2.50 14.75 262,371 38.22 679,912\n521,606 2.75 15.48 259,572 39.13 656,177\n493,696 3.00 16.19 256,945 39.98 634,610\n470,812 3.25 16.82 254,650 40.72 616,359\n450,545 3.50 17.42 252,276 41.35 598,941\n432,016 3.75 17.99 249,918 42.10 584,763\n420,273 4.00 18.37 248,242 42.24 570,717\n408,442 4.25 18.78 246,679 42.51 558,235\n397,456 4.50 19.18 245,047 42.52 543,387\n387,852 4.75 19.53 243,523 42.65 531,832\n384,845 4.85 19.64 243,053 42.82 529,766\n379,046 5.00 19.87 242,188 43.02 524,210\n371,936 5.25 20.15 240,983 43.37 518,566\n361,726 5.50 20.56 239,154 43.98 511,444\n354,923 5.75 20.85 237,895 44.41 506,746\n347,256 6.00 21.18 236,435 44.95 501,843\n338,905 6.25 21.54 234,672 45.49 495,696\n329,274 6.50 21.97 232,593 46.19 488,985\n321,519 6.75 22.33 230,836 46.81 483,828\n313,378 7.00 22.74 229,161 47.45 478,092\n302,759 7.25 23.27 226,557 48.28 469,947\n296,008 7.50 23.63 224,925 48.87 465,129\nConclusions\nWith its purchase of TCM in May, 2022, ODV has acquired a major portion of the historical East Tintic Mining District in UT. The east\nTintic district has been a prolific mining area throughout most of its history with several past producers located within the boundaries\nof the Corporation’s Tintic Project.\n119\nThe exploration, compilation and development work on the Trixie deposit conducted by ODV since its acquisition have resulted in a\nbetter understanding of the geology and mineralization. Based upon the work, the Corporation has been able to undertake an initial\nmineral resource estimate for the Trixie deposit, which remains open at depth and along strike.\nMicon QPs have reviewed and validated the programs conducted by ODV which are the basis for the initial mineral recourse\nestimate, as well as the mineral resource itself. It is Micon’s QPs opinion that the underlying exploration programs have been\nconducted according to industry best practices as outlined by CIM. Therefore, Micon’s QPs believe that the initial mineral resource\nestimate can be used as the basis for further exploration and development work to expand the mineral resources and to begin to\nconduct work leading to the undertaking of a PEA for the Trixie deposit.\nExploration Budget and Further Recommendations\nExploration Budget and Other Expenditures\nThe tables below summarize the estimated costs for completing the recommended drilling and exploration program contained in the\nrecommendations further described below. The budget is a cost estimate and guideline to complete the work. The budget is divided\ninto a two-phase approach, with the second phase contingent on the successful completion of the first.\nTintic Project, Recommended Budget for Further Work - Phase 1 (USD)\nCost/ft\n(approx.) All\nType of Activity included Quantity Total (USD)\nInfill and Exploration Drilling on Existing Resource $260/ft. 20,000 ft. $ 5,200,000\nRegional Drilling $260/ft 20,000 ft. $ 5,200,000\nSurface geochemical Surveys, Surface and Underground Sampling and Mapping,\nGIS Compilation $ 1,500,000\nLiDAR Survey $ 55,000\nOperational Permits $ 1,000,000\nEnvironmental Studies $ 1,000,000\nUpdate Mineral Resource Estimate $ 200,000\nMetallurgical Test Work $ 150,000\nProperty Wide Activities Subtotal $ 14,305,000\nContingency (~10%) $ 1,430,500\nTotal Phase 1 $ 15,735,500\nTintic Project, Recommended Budget for Further Work - Phase 2 (USD)\nCost/ft\n(approx.)\nType of Activity All included Quantity Total (USD)\nAdditional Infill and Exploration Drilling on Existing Resource $260/ft. 20,000 ft. $ 5,200,000\nAdditional Regional Drilling $260/ft 20,000 ft. $ 5,200,000\nCompletion of a PEA $ 2,000,000\nUnderground development for exploration ramp $2,500/ft 10,000 ft. $ 25,000,000\nContingency (~10%) $ 3,740,000\nTotal Phase 2 $ 41,140,000\nTotal Phase 1 and 2 $ 56,875,500\nIt is the opinion of the Micon QPs that all of the recommended work is warranted and that only the amount of exploration drilling on\nnew targets needs to be finalized. Micon and its QPs’ appreciate that the nature of the programs and expenditures may change as the\nfurther studies are undertaken, and that the final expenditures and results may not be the same as originally proposed.\n120\nThe Micon QPs are of the opinion that the ODV’s recommended work program and proposed expenditures are appropriate, warranted\nand well thought out. The Micon QPs believe that the proposed budget reasonably reflects the type and amount of the activities\nrequired to advance the Trixie deposit.\nFurther Recommendations\nBased on the results of the Initial MRE, Micon’s QPs recommend further exploration and development mineral resource estimate of\nTrixie deposit. It is recommended that ODV continues with underground exploration drilling at Trixie 625 L, together with continued\nface sampling and mapping along strike and down dip of the mineral resource and to infill areas currently defined as containing\ninferred resources. It is also recommended that, since the continued underground face sampling has been beneficial to the\ndevelopment of the Tintic Project, exploration development continue in order to improve underground access from surface to the\ndeeper levels of the mine. In addition to exploration at Trixie, it is recommended that ODV continue its exploration program on the\nother mineral targets on the Tintic Property with continued surface mapping and sampling, data compilation and surface drilling of\nregional high sulphidation, CRD and porphyry targets.\nIt is recommended that ODV move to a PEA at Trixie, by conducting additional metallurgical work, along with further engineering\nstudies on mining and reconciliation, continuing with environmental, permitting and community engagement and conducting a detailed\neconomic analysis.\nIn summary, the following work program is recommended.\n1. Exploration work:\n(a) Conduct an additional approximately 6,000 m (20,000 ft.) of underground diamond drilling for exploration and delineation\nat Trixie, with primary focus on the T2 and T4 deposits.\n(b) Continue to develop a structural model with underground face and back mapping at Trixie.\n(c) Incorporate the remaining 2022 drill results and 2023 drill results into an updated Mineral Resource Estimate.\n(d) Continue generative work within the greater Tintic Project including geophysical interpretation, historic data compilation,\nand geologic modelling of high sulphidation targets at North Lily and Eureka Standard, CRD targets at Tintic Standard\nand Burgin, and porphyry targets at Big Hill and Silver Pass areas.\n(e) Commence surface drilling of regional targets to potentially add further mineral resources in secondary deposits.\n(f) Perform a LiDAR survey on the property for collection of surface imagery and for aiding in structural interpretation.\n(g) Investigate the acquisition of a Bazooka drill to conduct short < 25 m (<82 ft) drill holes in conjunction with development\nunderground. This is separate from longer underground exploration holes from a set drilling station.\n(h) Investigate the use of conducting sludge sampling to investigate the lateral extent of the grade approximately up to 3.5 m\nin each wall of the drift as development progresses.\n(i) Conduct further density sampling for each of the geological domains.\n(j) Continue construction of the Trixie ramp to make exploration more accessible and continue to improve access to deeper\nlevels for continuous face sampling.\n2. Burgin Onsite Assay Laboratory\n(a) Continue to undertake bi-annual independent inspections of the onsite assay laboratory. Depending on the results of the\ninspections the time between reviews can be reassessed.\n121\n(b) Have the onsite laboratory participate in independent assay round robins as part of its QA/QC practices.\n(c) Conduct regular screen metallic assays for all gold samples above a pre-determined grade, possibly one (1) ounce of\ngold per short ton.\n3. Metallurgical Testwork:\n(a) Leaching tests to optimize conditions in terms of precious metal recovery, capital costs and operating costs.\n(b) Comparative testwork and techno-economic study to compare heap, VAT and agitation leaching technologies.\n(c) Geochemical characterization testwork on representative feed and residue samples.\n(d) Appropriate additional comminution testing, depending on the most likely process flowsheet.\n(e) Variability testwork.\n4. Preliminary economic assessment:\n(a) Complete independent metallurgical testwork at the Trixie Test Mine. Conduct variability testwork and separate\nrecoverability testwork for each zone. If the zones exhibit notable or significant differences in recoveries, incorporate into\nupdated resource model.\n(b) Complete further geotechnical work.\n(c) Identify further permitting considerations and potential environmental studies for the Project\n(d) Continue with further community engagement and social license management.\n(e) Undertake further detailed economic analysis based upon engineering and metallurgical trade-off studies.\n122"

The Corporation recognized an impairment\n15\n328031.00001/116753121.9\non its Bonanza Ledge II Project of $58.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, triggered by\ncontinuing operational challenges leading to lower production and revenues than originally planned.\nThe Bonanza Ledge II Project is a small scale and short life project, which allows the Corporation to facilitate\n(a) opportunities for managing historical reclamation obligations inherited by the Corporation, (b) hands on\ntraining and commissioning of the Corporation’s mining and processing complex for the Cariboo Project\nand (c) maintain the economic and social benefits for the First Nations partners and communities. As such,\nin the fourth quarter of 2021, the Corporation continued with its operations at the Bonanza Ledge II Project.\nOn October 27, 2021, the Province of British Columbia, Lhtako Dené First Nation and the Corporation\nannounced the approval of amendments to Mines Act Permits M-238 and M-198 allowing for the expansion\nof the existing Bonanza Ledge II underground mine. These amendments support the ongoing employment\nof 127 workers at the mine. The expansion of the Bonanza Ledge II project allows for continuity of mining\nactivities while the Cariboo Project environmental assessment proceeds. The Environmental Assessment\nprocess is still on schedule with granting of the Certificate anticipated in the fourth quarter 2022.\nThe Corporation cautions that the decision to undertake test mining at Bonanza Ledge II has been taken\nwithout the benefit of a feasibility study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability,\nand, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material\nor the cost of such recovery. The Corporation cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher\nrisk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or\nat all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production would have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Corporation's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations.\nFailure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the\nCorporation's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing current operations at Bonanza Ledge II, as\ncontemplated, the Corporation will not be basing its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility\nstudy of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability. The Corporation cautions that\ntest mining at Bonanza Ledge could be suspended at any time.\n• $80 Million Non-Brokered Private Placement\nOn January 8, 2021, the Corporation closed the first tranche of a non-brokered private placement of\n9,346,464 units at a price of $7.50 per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $68.6 million.\nEach unit consisted of one (1) pre-Consolidation Common Share and one-half of one (½) Warrant, a\nWarrant holder will be required to exercise three (3) whole Warrants in order to purchase one whole post-\nConsolidation Common Share for a total price of $30.00 on or prior to December 1, 2023.

The Environmental and Sustainability Committee\nhas held one meeting during the financial year ended December 31, 2021.\nSpecialized Skills\nThe Corporation’s business requires specialized skills and knowledge in the areas of geology, mining,\nprocessing, environmental management and gold market. To date, the Corporation has been able to locate\nand retain such professionals in Canada and Mexico, and believes it will be able to continue to do so.\nEmployees\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Corporation had 310 employees.\nCompetitive Conditions\nThe Corporation competes with other companies that focus on the discovery and acquisition of properties\nconsidered to have commercial potential. The Corporation also competes with other precious metals\nfocused companies for capital and human resources. See “Description of Business - Risk Factors - Risks\nFactors related to the Corporation - Competition”.\nRisk Factors\nThe Corporation’s business being the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties in\nCanada and worldwide, an investment in its shares is speculative and involves a high degree of risks. The\nrisk factors listed below could materially affect the Corporation’s financial condition and/or future operating\nresults, and could cause actual events to differ materially from those described in Forward-Looking\nInformation relating to or made by the Corporation.\nIn evaluating the Corporation and its business, the readers should carefully consider the risk factors which\nfollow and the risks set forth in the Corporation’s continuous disclosure documents filed on SEDAR. These\nrisk factors may not be a definitive list of all risk factors associated with an investment in the Corporation or\nin connection with its business and operations.\nThe risks described herein and in other documents forming part of the Corporation’s disclosure record are\nnot the only risks facing the Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the\nCorporation, or that the Corporation currently deems immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect\nits business. Prospective purchasers or holders of Common Shares should give careful consideration to all\nrisk factors enumerated below.\nRisks Factors Related to the Corporation\n• Mineral Exploration and Development\nMineral exploration and development is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. While the discovery\nof a mineralized material body may result in substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are\ncommercially mineable and ultimately developed into producing mines. There is no assurance that any\nexploration properties will be commercially mineable.\nShould any mineral resources exist, substantial expenditures will be required to confirm mineral reserves\nwhich are sufficient to commercially mine and to obtain the required environmental approvals and permitting\nrequired to commence commercial operations. The decision as to whether a property contains a\ncommercially viable mineral deposit and should be brought into production will depend upon the results of\nexploration programs and/or feasibility studies, and the recommendations of duly qualified engineers and/or\ngeologists, all of which involves significant expense. This decision will involve consideration and evaluation\nof several significant factors including, but not limited to: (a) costs of bringing a property into production,\nincluding exploration and development work, preparation of production feasibility studies and construction\n23\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nof production facilities; (b) availability and costs of financing; (c) ongoing costs of production; (d) metal\nprices; (e) environmental compliance regulations and restraints (including potential environmental liabilities\nassociated with historical exploration activities); and (f) political climate and/or governmental regulation and\ncontrol. Development projects are also subject to the successful completion of engineering studies,\nissuance of necessary governmental permits, and availability of adequate financing. Development projects\nhave no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow.\nWhile the Cariboo Project is in development stage and the results of the 2020 MRE are demonstrating the\nexistence of an interesting mineral resource, the Corporation cannot give any assurance that the\ndevelopment of the Cariboo Project will result in an economically viable producing mine.\n• Mining Operations\nMining operations are and will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration,\ndevelopment and production of mineral resources and mineral reserves including unusual or unexpected\ngeological formations, geotechnical challenges and other conditions such as formation pressures, fire,\npower outages, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to obtain suitable machinery,\nequipment or labour, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property, and possible\nenvironmental damage that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not\neliminate or adequately mitigate. The Corporation may be subject to liability for pollution, cave-ins or\nhazards against which it cannot insure or against which it may elect not to insure. The payment of such\nliabilities may have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Corporation.\n• Operations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\nCertain operations described herein, including the test mining at Bonanza Ledge II, processing of the\nstockpile at the Sapuchi mine, and ongoing test mining being carried out by the current owners of the Trixie\nmine, have been taken without the benefit of a feasibility study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic\nand technical viability (and in the case of Sapuchi and Trixie without the benefit of a technical report\ndemonstrating the existence of a mineral resource), and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of\nachieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. Historically, such projects\nhave a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that production will\ncommence, continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The\nfailure to commence or continue production would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's\nability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production\ncosts would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's cash flow and potential profitability. In\ncontinuing current operations at Bonanza Ledge II, commencing processing at Sapuchi, and, if applicable,\ncontinuing operations at the Trixie mine, as contemplated, the Corporation will not be basing its decision to\ncontinue such operations on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical\nviability (and in the case of Sapuchi and Trixie without the benefit of a technical report demonstrating the\nexistence of a mineral resource). The Corporation cautions that test mining at Bonanza Ledge or Trixie\ncould be suspended at any time.\n• Industry Conditions\nThe exploration for and development of mineral deposits involve significant risks and while the discovery\nof a mineralized material body may result in substantial rewards, few properties that are explored are\nultimately developed into producing mines. All of the Corporation’s properties are in the development or\nexploration stage and the Corporation is presently not commercially exploiting any of its properties and its\nfuture success will depend on its capacity to generate revenues from a commercially producing property.\nThe discovery of mineral deposits depends on a number of factors, including the professional qualification\nof its personnel in charge of exploration. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on\na number of factors, some of which are the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and\nproximity to infrastructure, as well as metal prices which are highly cyclical and government regulations,\n24\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nincluding regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of\nminerals and environmental protection. In the event that the Corporation wishes to commercially exploit\none of its properties, the exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination\nof these factors may result in the Corporation not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. The\nCorporation’s operations will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally encountered in the exploration\nand development of mineral deposits. Mining operations generally involve a high degree of risk, including\nunusual and unexpected geologic formations.\n• Regulatory Matters\nThe Corporation’s activities are subject to governmental laws and regulations. These activities can be\naffected at various levels by governmental regulation governing prospecting and development, price\ncontrol, taxes, labour standards and occupational health, expropriation, mine safety, compliance with\nsecurities matters and other matters. Exploration and commercialization are subject to various federal,\nprovincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws impose\nhigh standards on the mining industry to monitor the discharge of wastewater and report the results of such\nmonitoring to regulatory authorities, to reduce or eliminate certain effects on or into land, water or air, to\nprogressively rehabilitate mine properties, to manage hazardous wastes and materials and to reduce the\nrisk of worker accidents.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or\nenforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities enjoining or curtailing\noperations or requiring corrective measures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any\nof which could result in significant expenditures. The Corporation may also be required to compensate\nprivate parties suffering loss or damage by reason of a breach of such laws, regulations or permitting\nrequirements. It is also possible that future laws and regulations, or more stringent enforcement of current\nlaws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures,\nrestrictions on or suspensions of the Corporation’s activities and delays in the exploration and development\nof the projects and properties.\nAmendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining\ncompanies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on the\nCorporation and cause increases in capital expenditures or development costs or require abandonment or\ndelays in development of new mining properties.\nAlso, no assurance can be made that Canada Revenue Agency and provincial agencies will agree with the\nCorporation’s characterization of expenses as Canadian exploration expenses or Canadian development\nexpense or the eligibility of such expenses as Canadian exploration expense under the Tax Act or any\nprovincial equivalent.\n• Environmental Risks and Hazards\nThe Corporation is subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These\nregulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land\nreclamation. They also set forth limitations on the general, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and\nhazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards\nand enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental\nassessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their\nofficers, directors and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation,\nif any, will not adversely affect the Corporation’s operations. Environmental hazards may exist on the\nproperties which are unknown to the Corporation at present and which have been caused by previous or\nexisting owners or operators of the properties. Reclamation costs are uncertain and planned expenditures\nestimated by management may differ from the actual expenditures required.\n25\n328031.00001/116753121.9\n• Taxation Laws or Reviews\nThe Corporation has operations and conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and it is subject to the\ntaxation laws of each such jurisdiction. These taxation laws are complicated and subject to change. The\nCorporation may also be subject to review, audit and assessment in the ordinary course. Any such changes\nin taxation law or reviews and assessments could result in higher taxes being payable or require payment\nof taxes due from previous years, which could adversely affect the Corporation’s liquidities. Taxes may also\nadversely affect the Corporation’s ability to repatriate earnings and otherwise deploy its assets.\n• Changes in Economic and Political Conditions and Regulations\nThe economics of the exploration and development of mining projects are affected by many factors,\nincluding the costs of exploration and development, variations of grade of mineralized material discovered,\nfluctuations in metal prices, foreign exchange rates and the prices of goods and services, applicable laws\nand regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting\ngoods and services. Depending on the price of minerals, the Corporation may determine that it is neither\nprofitable nor advisable to acquire or develop properties.\nThe Corporation’s mineral properties are located in Canada and Mexico. Economic and political conditions\nin these countries could adversely affect the business activities of the Corporation. These conditions are\nbeyond the Corporation’s control, and there can be no assurances that any mitigating actions by the\nCorporation will be effective.\nChanging laws and regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions may increase\nthe costs related to the Corporation’s activities including the cost of maintaining its properties. Operations\nmay also be affected to varying degrees by changes in government regulations with respect to restrictions\non exploration and development activities, price controls, export controls, income taxes, royalties,\nexpropriation of property, environmental legislation (including specifically legislation enacted to address\nclimate change) and mine safety. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted. Economic\ninstability could result from current global economic conditions and could contribute to currency volatility\nand potential increases to income tax rates, both of which could significantly impact the Corporation’s\nprofitability.\nThe Corporation’s activities are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing worker health and\nsafety, employment standards, waste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine\ndevelopment, protection of endangered and protected species and other matters. Regulators have broad\nauthority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations or standards.\nRisk factors specific to certain jurisdictions are described throughout, including specifically “Security in\nMexico”. The occurrence of the various factors and uncertainties related to economic and political risks of\noperating in the Corporation’s jurisdictions cannot be accurately predicted and could have a material\nadverse effect on the Corporation.\n• Security in Mexico\nIn recent years, criminal activity and violence have increased and continue to increase in parts of Mexico.\nThe mining sector has not been immune to the impact of criminal activity and violence, including in the form\nof kidnapping for ransom and extortion by organized crime, direct armed robberies of mining operations\nand the theft and robbery of supply convoys, including specifically for diesel. The Corporation takes\nmeasures to protect employees, property and production facilities from these and other security risks. There\ncan be no assurance, however, that security incidents, in the future, will not have a material adverse effect\non the Corporation’s operations.\n26\n328031.00001/116753121.9\n• Mineral Assets outside of Canada\nSome of the Corporation’s mineral assets are located outside of Canada and are held indirectly through\nforeign affiliates. It may be difficult if not impossible to enforce judgments obtained in Canadian courts\npredicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of certain provinces against the\nCorporation’s assets that are located outside of Canada.\n• Permits, Licences and Approvals\nThe operations of the Corporation require licences and permits from various governmental authorities. The\nCorporation believes it holds or is in the process of obtaining all necessary licences and permits to carry on\nthe activities, which it is currently conducting under applicable laws and regulations. Such licences and\npermits are subject to changes in regulations and in various operating circumstances. There can be no\nguarantee that the Corporation will be able to obtain all necessary licences and permits that may be required\nto maintain its mining activities, construct mines or milling facilities and commence operations of any of its\nexploration properties. In addition, if the Corporation proceeds to production on any exploration property, it\nmust obtain and comply with permits and licences which may contain specific conditions concerning\noperating procedures, water use, the discharge of various materials into or on land, air or water, waste\ndisposal, spills, environmental studies, abandonment and restoration plans and financial assurances. There\ncan be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to obtain such permits and licences or that it will be\nable to comply with any such conditions.\n• Mergers, Acquisitions or Joint Ventures\nThe Corporation may evaluate from time to time opportunities to merge, acquire and joint venture assets\nand businesses or conduct any other type of transaction. Global landscape has changed and there are\nrisks associated to such transactions due to liabilities and evaluations with the aggressive timelines of\nclosing transactions from increased competition. There is also a risk that the review and examination\nprocess might be inadequate and cause material negative outcomes. These transactions may be significant\nin size, may change the scale of the Corporation’s business and may expose it to new geographic, political,\noperating, financial and geological risks. Any transactions would be accompanied by risks, such as the\ndifficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel; the potential disruption of the Corporation’s ongoing\nbusiness; the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the Corporation;\nthe maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; the impairment of relationships\nwith employees, customers and contractors as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\ndilution of the Corporation’s present shareholders or of its interests in its assets or the decision to grant\ninterests to a joint venture partner; and the potential unknown liabilities. There can be no assurance that\nthe Corporation would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in\nconnection with such transactions or joint ventures. There may be no right for shareholders to evaluate the\nmerits or risks of any future transaction or joint venture undertaken except as required by applicable laws\nand regulations.\n• Completion of announced transactions\nFrom time to time the Corporation may enter into binding transactions to acquire assets such as mining\ncompanies, metals or mineral projects and properties. There can be no assurances the Corporation will\nsuccessfully complete any announced transactions as a variety of conditions may exist that need to be\nwaived or satisfied prior to completion. There can be no certainty that proposed benefits of transactions to\nacquire such assets will be realized as anticipated.\nExploration for metals and minerals is a speculative venture necessarily involving substantial risk. There is\nno certainty that the expenditures on any given projects will result in discoveries of commercial quantities\nof minerals.\n27\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nIf mineable deposits are discovered, substantial expenditures are required to establish reserves through\ndrilling, to develop processes to extract the resources and, in the case of new properties, to develop the\nextraction and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for extraction. Although substantial\nbenefits may be derived from the discovery of a major deposit, no assurance can be given that resources\nwill be discovered in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for\ndevelopment can be obtained on terms acceptable to the Corporation or at all.\n• Local Communities, Indigenous Peoples and First Nations\nIndigenous title claims, rights to consultation/accommodation and the Corporation’s relationship with local\ncommunities may affect the Corporation’s existing exploration and development projects. Governments in\nmany jurisdictions must consult with indigenous peoples and First Nations with respect to grants of mineral\nrights or surface rights and the issuance or amendment of project authorizations. Consultation and other\nrights of indigenous peoples and first nations may require accommodations, including undertakings\nregarding employment, royalty payments and other matters. This may affect the Corporation’s ability to\nacquire, within a reasonable time frame, effective mineral titles or surface rights in these jurisdictions,\nincluding in some parts of Canada, in which indigenous or local communities’ titles are claimed, and may\naffect the timetable and costs of development of mineral properties in these jurisdictions. The risk of\nunforeseen indigenous title claims also could affect exploration and development projects. These legal\nrequirements may also affect the Corporation’s ability to transfer existing projects or to develop new\nprojects.\nThe Corporation’s relationship with the communities in which it conducts activities are critical to ensure the\nfuture success of its existing activities and the exploration and development of its projects. There is an\nincreasing level of public concern relating to the perceived effect of mining activities on the environment\nand on communities impacted by such activities. Adverse publicity relating to the mining industry generated\nby non-governmental organizations and others could have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s reputation\nor financial condition and may impact its relationship with the communities in which it conducts activities.\nWhile the Corporation is committed to working in a socially responsible manner, there is no guarantee that\nthe Corporation’s efforts in this regard will mitigate this potential risk.\nThe inability of the Corporation to maintain positive relationships with local communities may result in\nadditional obstacles to permitting, increased legal challenges, or other disruptive operational issues at any\nof the Corporation’s projects, and could have a significant adverse impact on the Corporation’s share price\nand financial condition.\n• Competition\nThe Corporation activities are directed towards the exploration, evaluation and development of mineral\ndeposits. There is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by the Corporation will result in discoveries\nof commercial quantities of mineral deposits. There is aggressive competition within the mining industry for\nthe discovery and acquisition of properties considered to have commercial potential. The Corporation will\ncompete with other interests, many of which have greater financial resources than it will have, for the\nopportunity to participate in promising projects. Significant capital investment is required to achieve\ncommercial production from successful exploration efforts, and the Corporation may not be able to\nsuccessfully raise funds required for any such capital investment.\n• Potential Fraud and Corruption\nThe Corporation is subject to risks related to potential to gain benefits from improper transactions and\nfinancial reporting to hide operational deficiencies or enhance remuneration. Other risks include the\npotential for fraud and corruption by suppliers, personnel or government officials and which may implicate\nthe Corporation, compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws. The Corporation’s internal controls might\nnot be sufficient or sophisticated enough to identify adequately all potential fraud and corruption.\n28\n328031.00001/116753121.9\n• Anti-Bribery Laws\nThe Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and\nanti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions where we do business, prohibit companies and their intermediaries\nfrom making improper payments for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial\nadvantage. The Corporation’s policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry\nsubstantial penalties. The Corporation operates in jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and\nprivate sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery\nlaws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. There can be no assurances that the\nCorporation’s internal control policies and procedures will always protect it from reckless or other\ninappropriate acts committed by the Corporation’s affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws,\nor allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\n• Management\nThe Corporation is dependent on certain members of Management, particularly its Chief Executive Officer.\nThe loss of their services could adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to grow its\nbusiness, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business and financial condition.\nThe Corporation is dependent on the services of key executives and other highly skilled personnel focused\non advancing its corporate objectives as well as the identification of new opportunities for growth and\nfunding. The loss of these persons or its inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees\nrequired for its activities may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business and financial\ncondition. Further, while certain of the Corporation’s officers and directors have experience in the\nexploration development and operation of mineral properties, the Corporation remains highly dependent\nupon contractors and third parties in the performance of their exploration and development activities. There\ncan be no guarantee that such contractors and third parties will be available to carry out such activities on\nbehalf of the Corporation or be available upon commercially acceptable terms.\n• Implementation of business strategy\nThere can be no assurance that Osisko Development’s management team will be successful in\nimplementing its strategy (including as set out in this Annual Information Form) or that past results will be\nreproduced going forward. The management team may experience difficulties in effecting key strategic\ngoals such as the growth and investment in tier one assets, tier two assets and strategic assets, the sale\nof non-core assets or the development of exploration projects. The performance of the Corporation’s\noperations could be adversely affected if its management team cannot implement the stated business\nstrategy effectively.\n• Conflicts of Interest\nCertain directors and officers of the Corporation also serve as directors and officers of other companies\ninvolved in natural resource exploration and development; consequently, there is a possibility that such\ndirectors and officers will be in a position of conflict of interest. Any decision made by such directors and\nofficers involving the Corporation will be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to deal fairly\nand in good faith with the Corporation and such other companies. In addition, such directors will declare,\nand refrain from voting on, any matter in which such directors may have a material conflict of interest.\n• Labour Relations\nWhile the Corporation has good relations with its employees, there can be no assurance that it will be able\nto maintain positive relationships with its employees. In addition, relations between the Corporation and its\nemployees may be impacted by regulatory or governmental changes introduced by the relevant authorities\n29\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nin whose jurisdictions the Corporation carries on business as well as by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse\nchanges in such legislations or in the relationship between the Corporation and its employees could have\na material adverse impact on the Corporation’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n• Uninsured Hazards\nThe Corporation could be held responsible for certain events including environmental pollution, cave-ins or\nother hazards against which a corporation such as the Corporation cannot insure or against which it may\nelect not to insure, taking into consideration the importance of the premiums or other reasons. The payment\nof amounts relating to liability of the aforementioned hazards could cause the loss of the Corporation’s\nassets.\n• Uncertainty of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates\nMineral resource and mineral reserve figures are only estimates. Mineral resource and mineral reserve\nestimates have inherent uncertainty. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on knowledge,\nmining experience, analysis of drilling results and industry practices. While the Corporation believes that\nthe mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, as applicable, in respect of properties in which the\nCorporation holds a direct interest reflect best estimates, the estimating of mineral resources and mineral\nreserves is a subjective process and the accuracy of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates is a\nfunction of the quantity and quality of available data, the accuracy of statistical computations, and the\nassumptions used and judgments made in interpreting available engineering and geological information.\nThere is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource and mineral reserve estimate and the actual\ndeposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from estimates.\nEstimated mineral resources and mineral reserves may have to be re-estimated based on changes in prices\nof gold or other minerals, further exploration or development activity or actual production experience. This\ncould materially and adversely affect estimates of the volume or grade of mineralization, estimated recovery\nrates or other important factors that influence such estimates. In addition, mineral resources are not mineral\nreserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resource estimate will ultimately be reclassified as\nproven or probable mineral reserves. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have\ndemonstrated economic viability.\n• Unanticipated metallurgical processing problems\nUnanticipated metallurgical processing problems may occur during operations, including, without limitation,\nmechanical problems with milling or extraction equipment, unexpected grade anomalies in processed\nmaterial, contaminants in processing or processed material, and the inability to operate tested processes\nat scale which can lead to lower metallurgical recoveries than expected and delay and impede operations,\nwhich may affect the profitability of the Cariboo Project. In addition, further metallurgical testing or\noperations may determine that the metals cannot be extracted as economically as anticipated.\n• Financing Risks and Additional Financing\nThe Corporation’s operations are subject to financing risks and additional financing may result in dilution or\npartial sale of assets. At the present time, the Corporation has exploration and development assets which\nmay generate periodic revenues through test mining but has no mines in the commercial production stage.\nThe Corporation’s ability to explore for and find potential economic projects, and then to bring them into\nproduction is highly dependent upon its ability to raise equity and debt capital in the financial markets. Any\nprojects that the Corporation develops will require significant capital expenditures. Currently, the\nCorporation does not have any producing projects and no sources of revenue and any projects it develops\nwill require significant capital expenditures. As a result, the Corporation may be required to seek additional\nsources of debt and equity financing in the near future. To obtain such funds, the Corporation may sell\nadditional securities including, but not limited to, the Corporation’s shares or some form of convertible\nsecurity, the effect of which could result in a substantial dilution of the equity interests of the Corporation’s\nshareholders. Alternatively, the Corporation may also sell a part of its interest in an asset in order to raise\n30\n328031.00001/116753121.9\ncapital. There is no assurance that the Corporation will be able to raise the funds required to continue its\nexploration programs and finance the development of any potentially economic deposit that is identified on\nacceptable terms or at all. The failure to obtain the necessary financing could have a material adverse effect\non the Corporation’s growth strategy, results of operations, financial condition and project scheduling. The\ndevelopment of the Cariboo Project remains subject to, among other things, Osisko Development securing\nadequate financing on conditions acceptable to it.\n• Operating Cash Flow\nThe Corporation has negative cash flow from operations. If additional funds are needed, there is no\nassurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available or that these financings will be\non terms at least as favourable to the Corporation as those previously obtained, or at all.\n• Acquisitions and integration\nFrom time to time, Osisko Development examines opportunities to acquire additional mining assets and\nbusinesses. Any acquisition that the Corporation may choose to complete may be of a significant size, may\nchange the scale of the Corporation’s business and operations, and may expose Osisko Development to\nnew or greater geographic, political, operating, financial, legal and geological risks. The Corporation’s\nsuccess in its acquisition activities depends on its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate\nacceptable terms for any such acquisition and integrate the acquired operations successfully with those of\nthe Corporation. Any acquisitions and any potential acquisitions would be accompanied by risks. For\nexample, there may be a significant change in commodity prices after the Corporation has committed to\ncomplete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; a mineralized material body\nmay prove to be below expectations; Osisko Development may have difficulty integrating and assimilating\nthe operations and personnel of any acquired companies (which may be compounded by geographical\nseparation, unanticipated costs, and the loss of key employees), realizing anticipated synergies and\nmaximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform\nstandards, policies and controls across the organization; the integration of the acquired business or assets\nmay divert the attention of management or disrupt the Corporation’s ongoing business and its relationships\nwith employees, customers, suppliers and contractors; and the acquired business or assets may have\nunknown liabilities which may be significant. In the event that the Corporation chooses to raise debt capital,\nit may reduce its financial flexibility as the Corporation services interest and debt repayments. If the\nCorporation chooses to use equity as consideration for any such acquisition, existing shareholders may\nsuffer dilution. In addition, many companies in the mining industry have recently seen substantial downward\npressure on their equity values after announcing significant acquisitions. There is a risk that if Osisko\nDevelopment was to announce a significant acquisition, the value of the Corporation’s common shares\ncould decrease over the short-, medium- and/or long-term. The Corporation cannot assure that it can\ncomplete any acquisition or business arrangement that it pursues, or is pursuing, on favorable terms, or\nthat any acquisitions or business arrangements completed will ultimately benefit the Corporation’s\nbusiness. There can be no assurance that the Corporation would be successful in overcoming the risks\nnoted above or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions.\n• Factors beyond the control of Osisko Development\nThe potential profitability of mineral properties is dependent upon many factors beyond the Corporation’s\ncontrol. For instance, world prices of and markets for minerals are unpredictable, highly volatile, potentially\nsubject to governmental fixing, pegging and/or controls and respond to changes in domestic, international,\npolitical, social and economic environments. Another factor is that rates of recovery of minerals from mined\nmineralized material (assuming that such mineral deposits are known to exist) may vary from the rate\nexperienced in tests and a reduction in the recovery rate will adversely affect profitability and, possibly, the\neconomic viability of a property. Profitability also depends on the costs of operations, including costs of\nlabour, equipment, electricity, environmental compliance or other production inputs. Such costs will\nfluctuate in ways the Corporation cannot predict and are beyond the Corporation’s control, and such\nfluctuations will impact on profitability and may eliminate profitability altogether. Additionally, due to\n31\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nworldwide economic uncertainty, (i) the availability and cost of funds for development and other costs have\nbecome increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to project; and (ii) global supply chain may also be negatively\naffected. These changes and events may materially affect the financial performance of the Corporation and\nthey may also negatively impact the project schedule.\n• Lack of Insurance Coverage\nThe Corporation may be subject to liability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards against which it\ndoes not or cannot economically insure. Mining is capital intensive and subject to a number of risks and\nhazards, including environmental pollution, accidents or spills, industrial and transportation accidents,\nlabour disputes, changes in the regulatory environment, natural phenomena (such as inclement weather\nconditions, earthquakes, pit wall failures and cave-ins) and encountering unusual or unexpected geological\nconditions. Such risk and hazards might impact the Corporation’s business. Consequently, many of the\nforegoing risks and hazards could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Corporation’s mineral\nproperties or future processing facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in or\ninterruption of or cessation of their exploration or development activities, delay in or inability to receive\nrequired regulatory approvals, or costs, monetary losses and potential legal liability and adverse\ngovernmental action. The Corporation may be subject to liability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards\nagainst which it does not or cannot insure or against which it may reasonably elect not to insure because\nof the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could result in material economic harm to the Corporation.\n• Reliance on Information\nThe Contributed Osisko Assets are not stand-alone publicly-listed entities. As a result, all historical\ninformation relating to the Contributed Osisko Assets presented in this AIF has been provided in reliance\non the information made available by Osisko Gold Royalties. Although the Corporation has no reason to\ndoubt the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by Osisko Gold Royalties, any inaccuracy\nor omission in such information contained in this AIF could result in unanticipated liabilities or expenses,\nincrease the costs to expected to be borne by the Corporation or adversely affect the operational plans of\nthe Corporation and its result of operations and financial condition.\n• Significant Influence of Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd\nAs a significant shareholder, Osisko Gold Royalties is entitled to exercise significant influence over all\nmatters requiring approval of the shareholders of the Corporation, including the election of directors,\ndetermination of significant corporate actions, amendments to the Corporation’s articles of incorporation\nand the approval of any business combinations, mergers or takeover attempts, in a manner that could\nconflict with the interests of other shareholders of the Corporation.\n• Risk related to the Contributed Osisko Assets and Reverse Takeover Transaction\nThe Corporation completed the Reverse Takeover Transaction to create a growth-oriented developer with\nprospective gold camps in Canada and Mexico. The Corporation may be unable to successfully integrate\nthe businesses of the Contributed Osisko Assets and realize the anticipated benefits of the Reverse\nTakeover Transaction. Achieving the benefits of the Reverse Takeover Transaction will depend in part on\nthe ability of the Corporation to effectively capitalize on its scale, to realize the anticipated capital, operating\nand financial synergies, to profitably sequence the growth prospects of its asset base and to maximize the\npotential of its improved growth opportunities and capital funding opportunities as a result of combining the\nbusinesses and operations the Contributed Osisko Assets. A variety of factors, including those risk factors\nset forth in this AIF may adversely affect the ability of the Corporation to achieve the anticipated benefits of\nthe Reverse Takeover Transaction.\n32\n328031.00001/116753121.9\n• Uncertainty of Ownership Rights and Boundaries of Resource Properties\nThere is no assurance that the rights of ownership and other rights in concessions held by the Corporation\nare not subject to loss or dispute, particularly because such rights may be subject to prior unregistered\nagreements or transfers or other land claims and may be affected by defects and adverse Laws and\nregulations which have not been identified by the Corporation. There is no guarantee that title to the\nproperties will not be challenged or impugned. The Corporation’s property interest may be subject to prior\nunregistered agreements or transfers or native land claims and title may be affected by undetected defects.\n• Third Party Approvals\nThe Corporation may require the consent or approval of third parties in order to enter into or complete\ncertain agreements or transaction necessary in the course of its operations. There can be no assurance\nthat such third parties, which may include shareholders, regulatory bodies or entities with an interest in the\napplicable property or others (including water supply management and availability), will provide the required\napproval or consent or enter into such agreement in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to obtain such third\nparty approval may result in a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations and financial\ncondition.\n• Community Relations, Social License and Land Claim\nMaintaining a positive relationship with the communities in which the Corporation operates is critical to its\nbusiness operations and the development of the Cariboo Project.\nThe Corporation may come under pressure to demonstrate that other stakeholders (including employees,\ncommunities surrounding operations and the countries in which they respectively operate) benefit and will\ncontinue to benefit from its commercial activities, and/or that it operates in a manner that will minimize any\npotential damage or disruption to the interests of those stakeholders.\nErosion of social licence or activities of third parties seeking to call into question social licence may have\nthe effect of slowing down the development of new projects and potentially may increase the cost of\nconstructing and operating these projects. Productivity may be reduced due to restriction of access,\nproceedings initiated or delays in permitting and there may also be extra costs associated with improving\nthe relationship with the surrounding communities.\nWhile the Corporation is committed to operating in a socially responsible manner and working towards\nentering into agreements in satisfaction of such requirements that its efforts will be successful, in which\ncase interventions by third parties, there is no guarantee that its efforts will be successful, in which case\ninterventions by third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial\nposition and operations.\n• Permits, Licences and Approvals\nThe operations of the Corporation require licences and permits from various governmental authorities. Such\nlicences and permits are subject to changes in regulations and in various operating circumstances. There\ncan be no guarantee that the Corporation will be able to obtain all necessary licences and permits that may\nbe required to maintain its business operations and mining activities including the development of the\nCariboo Project. In addition, if the Corporation proceeds to production on any exploration property, it must\nobtain and comply with permits and licences which may contain specific conditions concerning operating\nprocedures, water use, the discharge of various materials into or on land, air or water, waste disposal, spills,\nenvironmental studies, abandonment and restoration plans and financial assurances. There can be no\nassurance that the Corporation will be able to obtain such permits and licences or that it will be able to\ncomply with any such conditions.\n33\n328031.00001/116753121.9\n• Reliance on Historical Data\nAlthough the Corporation’s normal data verification procedures have been employed in connection with the\ncalculations of the mineral resource estimation on the Cariboo Project and sampling, analytical and test\ndata underlying the estimated mineral resources have been verified by qualified persons, an extensive\namount of historical data and records on the Cariboo Project was relied on in establishing these\ncalculations. The Corporation cannot provide any comfort that it can rely upon, verify or necessarily\nauthenticate such historical information in connection with its exploitation of the Cariboo Project. The\nCorporation cannot guarantee that the historical records that are available are free from material errors or\ninaccuracies. While the Corporation believes that the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates in\nrespect of its Cariboo Project reflect best estimates, the estimating of mineral resources is a subjective\nprocess and the accuracy of mineral resource estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available\ndata, the accuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in\ninterpreting available engineering and geological information. There is significant uncertainty in any mineral\nresource estimate and the actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ\nmaterially from estimates.\n• Reputational Risks\nReputational risk is the risk that an activity undertaken by an organization or its representatives will impair\nits image in the community or lower public confidence in it, resulting in loss of revenue, legal action or\nincreased regulatory oversight and loss of valuation and share price. Possible sources of reputational risk\ncould come from, but not limited to, operational failures, non-compliance with laws and regulations, or\nleading an unsuccessful financing. In addition to its risk management policies, controls and procedures, the\nCorporation has a formal Code of Ethics to help manage and support Osisko Development’s reputation.\n• Infrastructure, Supplies and Inflation\nThe availability of skilled labour, electricity and other necessary supplies at an economic cost cannot be\nassured. These are integral requirements for exploration, development and production facilities on mineral\nproperties. Prices for goods and services will fluctuate in relation to the level of investment in the mining\nsector; it is reasonable to expect that increased demand could impact the Corporation’s future economic\nprojections and competitiveness, as it may entail a meaningful increase in costs for various goods and\nservices.\nImprovements in the economic conditions for the mining industry as a whole will typically result in increases\nto both the costs of planned exploration and development activities, which must also be factored into\neconomic models used in projections for future development and potential operations. Increased demand\nfor, and costs of, goods or services could result in delays if they cannot be obtained in a timely manner due\nto inadequate availability, and may cause scheduling difficulties and delays due to the need to coordinate\ntheir availability, any of which could materially increase project exploration, development and/or\nconstruction costs. These factors could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation’s operations\nand profitability.\n• Information technology systems\nOsisko Development is dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of its operations.\nThe Corporation could be adversely affected by network disruptions from a variety of sources, including,\nwithout limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in\ndesign. The Corporation’s operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of\nnetworks, equipment information technology systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to\nmitigate the risk of failure. Any of these or other events could result in information system failures, delays\nand/or increases in capital expenditures. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of\ninformation technology disruptions, the Corporation could potentially be subject to production downtimes,\noperational delays, destruction or corruption of data, any of which could have a material adverse effect on\n34\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nthe Corporation’s cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. From time to\ntime, Osisko Development pursues investments and initiatives to improve the productivity and efficiency of\nexisting systems and operations, including through investments in digital technologies. There can be no\ncertainty that some or any of such investments and initiatives will meet the Corporation’s capital allocation\nobjectives. In addition, certain of such investments and initiatives are still in the early stages of evaluation,\nand additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact. Further, there can be\nno certainty as to the time required for the Corporation to extract value from these investments or initiatives,\nor that the Corporation will achieve any anticipated savings or efficiency improvements.\n• Equipment shortages and access restrictions\nThe Corporation’s interest in the Cariboo Project will require adequate infrastructure, such as roads, bridges\nand sources of power and water, for future exploration and development activities. The lack of availability\nof these items on terms acceptable to the Corporation or the delay in availability of these items could prevent\nor delay exploitation or development of the Corporation’s mineral properties. Natural resource exploration,\ndevelopment, processing and mining activities are dependent on the availability of mining, drilling and\nrelated equipment in the particular areas where such activities are conducted. A limited supply of such\nequipment or access restrictions may affect the availability of such equipment to the Corporation and may\ndelay exploration, development or extraction activities. Certain equipment may not be immediately\navailable, or may require long lead time orders. A delay in obtaining necessary equipment could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations and financial results.\n• Litigation, the causes and costs of which cannot be known.\nThe Corporation is subject to litigation arising in the normal course of business and may be involved in\ndisputes with other parties in the future which may result in litigation. The causes of potential future litigation\ncannot be known and may arise from, among other things, business activities, environmental laws, volatility\nin stock price or failure or alleged failure to comply with disclosure obligations. The results of litigation\ncannot be predicted with certainty. If the Corporation is unable to resolve litigation favourably, either by\njudicial determination or settlement, it may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial\nperformance and results of operations.\nIn the event of a dispute involving the foreign operations of the Corporation, the Corporation may be subject\nto the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the\njurisdiction of courts in Canada. The Corporation’s ability to enforce its rights could have a material adverse\neffect on its future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n• Climate Change\nThe Corporation recognizes that climate change is as much an international as it is a community concern\nwhich may affect its business and operations, directly or indirectly. The continuing rise in global average\ntemperatures has created varying changes to regional climates across the globe, resulting in risks to\nequipment and personnel. Governments at all levels are moving towards enacting legislation to address\nclimate change by regulating carbon emissions and energy efficiency, among other things. Where\nlegislation has already been enacted, regulation regarding emission levels and energy efficiency are\nbecoming more stringent. The mining industry as a significant emitter of greenhouse gas emissions is\nparticularly exposed to these regulations. Costs associated with meeting these requirements may be\nsubject to some offset by increased energy efficiency and technological innovation; however, there is no\nassurance that compliance with such legislation will not have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and its share price.\nExtreme weather events (such as prolonged drought or freezing, increased flooding, increased periods of\nprecipitation and increased frequency and intensity of storms) have the potential to disrupt operations and\n35\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nthe transport routes. Extended disruptions could result in interruption to production which may adversely\naffect the Corporation’s business, results of operations, financial condition and its share price.\nClimate change is perceived as a threat to communities and governments globally. Stakeholders may\nincrease demands for emissions reductions and call upon mining companies to better manage their\nconsumption of climate-relevant resources (hydrocarbons, water etc.). This may attract social and\nreputational attention towards operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and its share price.\n• Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nThe Corporation may face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases,\nwhich could significantly disrupt its operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and\nfinancial conditions.\nTo that end, the Corporation’s business could be adversely impacted by the effects of the coronavirus or\nother epidemics. In December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in China and\nthe virus has now spread to several other countries, including Canada and the U.S., and infections have\nbeen reported globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a global\npandemic, prompting many national, regional, and local governments, including ones in the markets in\nwhich the Corporation will operate, to implement preventative or protective measures, such as travel and\nbusiness restrictions, temporary store closures, and wide-ranging quarantines and stay-at-home orders.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread global health crisis that adversely affects global\neconomies and financial markets.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Corporation’s business, including its operations and the market\nfor its securities, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted\nat this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak and the actions taken to contain\nor treat the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 globally could materially\nand adversely impact the Corporation’s business including without limitation, employee health, workforce\nproductivity, increased insurance premiums, continued limitations on travel, the availability of industry\nexperts and personnel, restrictions to its drill program and/or the timing to process drill and other\nmetallurgical testing, and other factors that will depend on future developments beyond the Corporation’s\ncontrol, which may have a material and adverse effect on the its business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the Corporation’s personnel or its contractors’ personnel will not be\nimpacted by these pandemic diseases and ultimately see its workforce productivity reduced or incur\nincreased safety and medical costs / insurance premiums as a result of these health risks.\n• Security in Mexico\nIn recent years, criminal activity and violence have increased and continue to increase in parts of Mexico.\nThe mining sector has not been immune to the impact of criminal activity and violence, including in the form\nof kidnapping for ransom and extortion by organized crime, direct armed robberies of mining operations\nand the theft and robbery of supply convoys, including specifically for diesel. The Corporation takes\nmeasures to protect employees, property and production facilities from these and other security risks. There\ncan be no assurance, however, that security incidents, in the future, will not have a material adverse effect\non our operations.\n• Currency Fluctuations\nThe Corporation is subject to currency risks. The Corporation’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar,\nwhich is exposed to fluctuations against other currencies. The Corporation’s activities are located in Canada\nand Mexico, and as such many of its expenditures and obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars and\n36\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nMexican pesos. The Corporation maintains its principal office in Montreal, Québec, Canada, and maintains\ncash accounts in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos and has monetary assets and liabilities\nin Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos.\nThe Corporation’s assets and liquidities are significantly affected by changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar\nand Canadian/Mexican peso exchange rates. Most expenses are currently denominated in Canadian, U.S.\ndollars and Mexican pesos. Exchange rate movements can therefore have a significant impact on the\nCorporation’s costs. The appreciation of non-Canadian dollar currencies against the Canadian dollar can\nincrease the costs of the Corporation’s activities.\n• Precious and Base Metal Prices\nThe development of the Corporation’s properties is dependent on the future prices of minerals and metals.\nAs well, should any of the Corporation’s properties eventually enter commercial production, the\nCorporation’s profitability will be significantly affected by changes in the market prices of minerals and\nmetals.\nThe price of precious and base metal prices can fluctuate widely and is affected by numerous factors\nincluding demand, inflation, strength of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold sales by\nthe central banks, forward sales by producers, global or regional political or financial events, and production\nand cost levels in major producing regions. In addition, prices are sometimes subject to rapid short-term\nchanges because of speculative activities. Even if the Corporation discovers commercial amounts of metals\non its properties, it may not be able to place the property into commercial production if precious and base\nmetal prices are not at sufficient levels.\n• Fluctuation in Market Value\nThe price of the Common Shares may be affected by global macroeconomic developments and market\nperceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries and location of assets, which may increase the\nvolatility of Common Share prices. The price of the Common Shares will also be affected by the\nCorporation’s financial conditions or results of operations as reflected in its liquidity position and earnings\nreports.\nOther factors unrelated to the Corporation’s operations and performance that may have an affect on the\nprice of the Common Shares include: the lessening in trading volume and general market interest in the\nCorporation’s securities may affect an investor’s ability to trade significant numbers of shares; the size of\nthe Corporation’s public float may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in the Corporation’s\nsecurities; and a substantial decline in the price of the Common Shares that persists for a significant period\nof time could cause the Corporation’s securities to be delisted further reducing market liquidity.\nAs a result of any of these factors, the market price of the Common Shares at any given point in time may\nnot accurately reflect the Corporation’s long-term value. Securities class action litigation often has been\nbrought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. The\nCorporation may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial\ncosts and damages and divert management’s attention and resources.\n• Dividend Policy\nNo dividends on the Common Shares have been paid to date. The Corporation anticipates that, for the\nforeseeable future, it will retain future earnings and other cash resources for the operation and development\nof its business. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board after taking into\naccount many factors, including the Corporation’s operating results, financial condition, and current and\nanticipated cash needs.\n37\n328031.00001/116753121.9\n• Public Company Obligations\nAs a publicly listed corporate entity, the Corporation is subject to evolving rules and regulations promulgated\nby a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the Canadian Securities\nAdministrators, the TSXV, and the International Accounting Standards Board, which govern corporate\ngovernance and public disclosure regulations. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and\ncomplexity creating many new requirements, which increase compliance costs and the risk of non-\ncompliance. The Corporation’s efforts to comply with these rules and obligations could result in increased\ngeneral and administration expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from financing,\ndevelopment, operations and, eventually, revenue-generating activities.\nDIVIDENDS\nSince its incorporation, Osisko Development has not paid any cash dividends on its outstanding common\nshares. Any future dividend payment will depend on Osisko Development’s financial needs to fund its\nexploration programs and its future financial growth and any other factors that the board deems necessary\nto consider in the circumstances. It is highly unlikely that any dividends will be paid in the next financial\nyear. Osisko Development is limited in its ability to pay dividends on its common shares by generally\napplicable restrictions under corporate law referred to “solvency tests”. See “Risk Factors”.\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nCommon Shares\nOsisko Development is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares without nominal or par\nvalue.\nThe rights, privileges, conditions and restrictions attaching to the Common Shares, as a class, are equal in\nall respects and include the following rights.\nDividends\nThe holders of the Common Shares shall have the right to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board,\nany dividend on such dates and for such amounts as the Board may from time to time determine.\nParticipation in case of Dissolution or Liquidation\nThe holders of the Common Shares shall have the right, upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of\nOsisko Development, to receive the remaining property of Osisko Development pro-rata among all holders\nof Common Shares.\nRight to Vote\nThe holders of the Common Shares shall have the right to one (1) vote per share at any meeting of the\nshareholders of Osisko Development.\nAs of May 19, 2022, 47,593,251 post-Consolidation Common Shares were issued and outstanding.\nMARKET FOR SECURITIES\nTrading Price and Volume\nCommon Shares\n38\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nThe Common Shares began their listing on the TSX-V following the Corporation’s Reverse Takeover\nTransaction in December 2020.

As a result of the\nConsolidation that took effect on May 4, 2022 of three (3) pre-Consolidation Common Shares for one (1)\npost-Consolidation Common Share, each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-third (1/3) of a post-\nConsolidation Common Share. Accordingly, a Warrant holder will be required to exercise three (3) whole\nWarrants in order to purchase one whole post Consolidation Common Share.\nThe Warrants were issued pursuant to four warrant indentures dated (i) October 29, 2020, as supplemented\non December 30, 2020, among the Corporation, Osisko Development Holdings Inc. and TSX Trust\nCompany, as warrant agent (the “Warrant Agent”); (ii) December 30, 2020 between the Corporation and\nthe Warrant Agent; (iii) January 8, 2021 between the Corporation and the Warrant Agent; and (iv) February\n5, 2021 between the Corporation and the Warrant Agent. In connection with the listing of the Warrants on\nthe TSX-V, each of the warrant indenture were amended by a supplemental warrant indenture dated\nSeptember 30, 2021 to merge all of the outstanding Warrants from the warrant indenture to the new warrant\nindenture with the effect of treating the outstanding Warrants as a single class of purposes of the listing of\nthe Warrants on the TSX-V and as a single mandate for the Warrant Agent.\nIn connection with the Non-Brokered Offering and the Brokered Offering, the Corporation entered into a\nwarrant indenture dated March 2, 2022 with the Warrant Agent providing for the issue of up to 23,258,750\nWarrants upon conversion of the Subscription Receipts, as well as a supplemental warrant indenture dated\nMarch 29, 2022.\nPrior Sales - Securities Not Listed or Quoted on a Marketplace\nThe only securities of the Corporation that were outstanding as of December 31, 2021 but not listed or\nquoted on a marketplace are the Options, the RSUs and the DSUs.\nThe price at which such securities have been issued by Osisko Development during the most recently\ncompleted financial year, the number of securities of the class issued at that price and the date on which\nsuch securities were issued are detailed hereinbelow.\nOptions\nThe following table sets forth the number of Options granted during the most recently completed financial\nyear, the date of grant and the exercise price thereof.

An initial Project Description and Engagement Plan have\nbeen submitted to the BC Environmental Assessment Office to initiate the provincial environmental\nassessment process.\nIn addition to the provincial environmental assessment approval, the federal and provincial permits,\napprovals and Authorizations that could potentially be applicable to the proposed Project includes:\n60\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nFederal Permits and Approvals potentially applicable to the Cariboo Project\n• Fisheries Act Authorization\n• Migratory Birds Convention Act\n• Navigation Convention Act\n• Navigation Protection Program Notification and/or Approval\n• Species at Risk Act Authorization\n• Explosive Magazine, Factory Licenses and Permits\n• Transportation of Dangerous Goods\nProvincial Permits and Approvals potentially applicable to the Cariboo Project\n• Mines Act Permit\n• Effluent Discharge Permit and Waste Storage Approval\n• Heritage Conservation Act Permits\n• Heritage Conservation Act Concurrence Letters\n• License of Occupation\n• Statutory Right of Way\n• Wildlife Act Permit\n• Construction Permit for a Potable Water Well\n• Water System Construction Permit\n• Short Term Use of Water Permit\n• Water Sustainability Act Approval\n• Water License\n• Licenses to Cut and Special Use Permit\n• Industrial Access Permit\n• Permit for Regulated Activities\nAs the Cariboo Project proceeds, specific permit requirements will be determined based on discussions\nwith the regulatory agencies.\n61\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nAgreements with Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd\nOn November 30, 2015, Barkerville entered into a letter agreement with Osisko Gold Royalties whereby\nOsisko Gold Royalties agreed to purchase 32 million common shares of Barkerville and a 1.5% NSR\nroyalty on the Cariboo Project. In connection therewith, Osisko Gold Royalties agreed to acquire 32 million\nflow-through common shares of Barkerville at a price of $0.32 per share, for total proceeds to Barkerville\nof $10,240,000.\nOsisko Gold Royalties also agreed to acquire a 1.5% NSR royalty on the Cariboo Project for a cash\nconsideration of $25 million. Osisko Gold Royalties and Barkerville also agreed to negotiate a gold stream\nagreement following the completion by Barkerville of a feasibility study on the Cariboo Project. According\nto the terms, following a 60-day negotiation period, if Osisko Gold Royalties and Barkerville had not\nentered into a gold stream agreement, Barkerville would either grant a right to Osisko Gold Royalties to\npurchase an additional 0.75% NSR royalty for consideration of $12.5 million or make a payment of\n$12.5 million to Osisko Gold Royalties.\nOn March 27, 2017, Barkerville announced it had entered into a letter agreement with Osisko Gold\nRoyalties whereby Osisko agreed to purchase an additional 0.75% NSR royalty on the Cariboo Project\nfor a cash consideration of $12,500,000 (paid). At the time, Osisko Gold Royalties owned a total NSR\nroyalty of 2.25% on all mineral current rights held by Barkerville. The grant of the additional royalty would\ncancel Osisko Gold Royalties’ royalty right, which was granted pursuant to the investment agreement\nbetween Osisko Gold Royalties and Barkerville dated February 5, 2016; however, Osisko Gold Royalties\nwould retain a right of first refusal relating to any gold stream offer received by Barkerville with respect to\nthe Cariboo Project.\nOn September 5, 2018, Barkerville entered into the Second Amended and Restated Royalty Purchase\nAgreement whereby Osisko Gold Royalties purchased an additional 1.75% NSR royalty on the Cariboo\nProject for a cash consideration of $20,000,000 (paid), with an option for Osisko Gold Royalties to purchase\nan additional 1.0% NSR royalty for $13,000,000 to bring the Cariboo Project NSR to 5%. On November 20,\n2020, Osisko exercised the option to purchase an additional 1% NSR royalty on the Cariboo Project, thus\nbringing the NSR royalty to 5%.\nOn September 23, 2019, Barkerville and Osisko Gold Royalties entered into a definitive agreement,\npursuant to which Osisko Gold Royalties acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of\nBarkerville that it did not already own by way of a plan of arrangement pursuant to which each shareholder\nof Barkerville (excluding Osisko Gold Royalties) received 0.0357 of an Osisko Gold Royalties Share for\neach Barkerville Share held.\nOn November 21, 2019, the Arrangement became effective and resulted in Barkerville becoming a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Osisko Gold Royalties.\nOn October 5, 2020, Osisko Gold Royalties and Barolo announced a binding letter agreement outlining\nthe terms upon which Osisko Gold Royalties would transfer certain mining properties (or securities of the\nentities that directly or indirectly own such mining properties), including the Cariboo Gold Project, and a\nportfolio of marketable securities, to Barolo in exchange for common shares of Barolo, which resulted in\na “reverse take-over” of Barolo under the policies of the TSX-V.\n62\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nSurface Rights Option Agreements\nTable 1 lists the properties where Barkerville owns the surface rights as well as the underlying option\nagreements under which the properties rights were acquired.\nTable 1 - Barkerville surface rights option agreements\nFee\nDistrict Crown simple Execution\nPID Lot Title # Grant # Owner Agreement Name Vendee Vendor Date\n004-056-582 41F BB1960681 41F/34 Barkerville Myrtle-Proserpine & BGM Huakan International 2011-May-05\nPromise Properties Mining Inc.\n004-056-710 1F CA6623323 1F/34 Barkerville Williams Creek BGM Williams Creek Gold 2016-May-02\nCrown Grants\n004-056-736 1B CA6623292 1B/35 Barkerville Williams Creek BGM Williams Creek Gold 2016-May-02\nCrown Grants\n004-056-752 32F CA4347922 32F Barkerville Williams Creek BGM Williams Creek Gold 2016-May-02\nCrown Grants\n004-056-787 4B CA4347919 4B/35 Barkerville Williams Creek BGM Williams Creek Gold 2016-May-02\nCrown Grants\n004-078-543 2F CA3322186 2F/34 Barkerville Blackbull & Canusa International Grand Lowhee 2000-Jul-28\nWayside Gold Mining Co.

Barkerville’s\nproject offices and related facilities are located in the town of Wells. The QR Mill is a wholly-owned and fully\npermitted milling and tailings facility approximately 110 km from Wells. An all-season road provides access\n(500 Nyland Lake Road).\nThe City of Quesnel is the primary supply and service centre for natural resource industries and has the\nclosest regional hospital. Manpower is also available in the region. The Cariboo Project has sufficient power\nand water to support a mining operation. Canadian National Railway provides rail access from Quesnel to\nthe Port of Vancouver.\nBarkerville has sufficient surface rights in the Cariboo Project area for mineral exploration and development\noperations. These rights are generally conveyed by the issuer’s Barkerville’s Crown-granted mineral claims\nor by specific permits, like those related to tailings and waste disposal areas, or water and timber use.\nThe climate allows for year-round mining operations, and there is enough readily available water to conduct\ndiamond drilling. The Cariboo Project area is subject to a semi-alpine continental climate with cool summers\nand cold winters. The weather is wet throughout the year, with a mean annual precipitation of up to 120 cm\nand accumulated snow depths up to 1.8 m. The mean 24-h temperature at Wells-Barkerville at an elevation\nof approximately 1,256 m (4,121 ft) is -9.2°C in January and 12.3°C in July.\nThe topography in the Cariboo Project area is mountainous, rising from a low point of approximately\n1,190 masl in the incised river valleys around the towns of Wells and Barkerville Historic Town & Park to a\n64\n328031.00001/116753121.9\npeak of 2,060 masl at Roundtop Mountain located 25 km south of Wells. Mount Proserpine, 11 km south\nof the town, summits at 1,830 masl. The area is well forested, and the mountains are typically covered with\nsubalpine forests, except near their peaks. Vegetation is dominated by Engelmann Spruce (Picea\nengelmann), Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and Subalpine Fir (Abies lasiocarpa),\naccompanied by alders and other deciduous varieties on lower wetter slopes flanking river valleys.\nProminent in the subalpine flora is the shrub Rhododendron albiflorum.\nHistory\nThe Cariboo Project contains several historical mines, including Cariboo Gold Quartz, Aurum and Mosquito\nCreek.\nAll “reserves” and “resources” estimates provided in this section are historical in nature and\nshould not be relied upon. The qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the\nhistorical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. It is unlikely they comply with\ncurrent NI 43-101 requirements or follow CIM Definitional Standards, and their relevance and\nreliability have not been verified. They are included in this section for illustrative purposes only and\nOsisko Development and Barkerville are not treating the historical estimate as current mineral\nreserves.\nHistorical Mines\nCariboo Gold Quartz Mine\nFred Wells purchased the Rainbow claim group from A.W. Sanders and formed Cariboo Gold Quartz Mining\nCompany Ltd in 1927. The Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine operated from 1927 to 1959 at Cow Mountain.\nProduction from the mine was from several zones: No.1, Tailings, Rainbow, Sanders and Pinkerton.\nIn October 1942, gold mining was classified as a non-war industry by the federal government and received\nno priority for labour or supplies. As a result, gold mines in British Columbia were unable to hire replacement\nlabour for the duration of the war.\nFollowing the purchase of the Island Mountain Mine in 1954, Cariboo Gold Quartz Mining Company Ltd\nfocused on developing higher grade pyrite-type replacement mineralized material. Subsequent activities in\nthe mine were mainly confined to the No. 1 and Tailings zones below the 1500 level (through the No.1\nshaft), in the Rainbow Zone (No. 2 shaft and No. 1-No. 2 shaft connection), in the Sanders Zone (No. 3\nshaft), and the Pinkerton Zone.\nThe mine closed on August 31, 1959.\nIn 1959, in its 33rd annual report, the company reported book reserves of 95,265 t of mineralized material,\nincluding a 1952 reserve write-down of 42,275 t of 9.26 g/t Au and another 52,990 t of 12.69 g/t Au scattered\nin 51 mineralized material remnants through 13 levels and across a distance of 10,500 ft (3,200 m).\nThe Cariboo Gold Quartz Mill continued operating using feed from the Aurum Mine until March 1967. During\nthe period between 1933 and 1967, a total of 1,951,944 t of mineralized material were mined, and 863,307 oz\nof gold and 91,652 oz of silver were recovered (MINFILE number 093H 019). The average recovery during\nthat period was 95.3%.\nIsland Mountain Mine (Aurum Mine)\nIn 1925, C.J. Seymour Baker acquired the Aurum Group, at which he worked until 1932.\nIn 1932, Newmont acquired the Aurum Group and eight (8) adjacent claims to form Island Mountain Mines\nCompany Ltd.\n65\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nMilling commenced in 1934 at a rate of 50 short tons per day and reached a peak of 149 st/d in 1941.\nQuartz-type mineralized material in diagonal vein structures and pyrite-type mineralized material in the Aurum\nlimestone unit were both extracted. The mine was developed over a strike length of 4,500 ft (1,371.6 m).\nAfter 1945, no further exploration or development was carried out west of the Aurum Fault, and in 1952 the\nmine suspended active exploration and development.\nUnder Newmont’s ownership, production from the mine was 770,093 st (699,536 t) from which 333,705 oz\nof gold and 48,130 oz of silver were recovered (MINFILE number 093H 006). The mill also recovered\n531 lbs of zinc and 134 lbs of lead.\nCariboo Gold Quartz Mining purchased the mine and equipment from Newmont in 1954 for a sum of\n$305,000. Underground workings extending northwest from the Island Mountain Mine into the Mosquito\nGroup are formally known as the Aurum Mine. The Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine and Island Mountain Mine do\nnot connect below Jack of Clubs Lake.\nMosquito Creek Mine\nAndrew H. Jukes of Calgary acquired the Mosquito Creek claim group and formed Mosquito Creek Gold in\n1971 to explore the ground above the Aurum Mine. Surface exploration drilling and underground\ndevelopment from 1971 to 1975 were financed by a joint venture agreement with the Home Oil Company\nLtd of Calgary. They conducted an extensive surface and underground exploration and development\nprogram on the property. In 1975, Mosquito Creek Gold purchased all of Home Oil Company’s interest in the\nproperty. Subsequently, Peregrine entered into a joint venture agreement with Mosquito Creek Gold,\nwhereby it ultimately earned a 50% working interest in the property.\nA total of 27,384 oz of gold were recovered from 86,248 t of mostly pyrite-type mineralized material milled\nduring the main production period (1980 to 1983). The operation failed due to low initial reserves and a low\ndiscovery rate of new mineralized material. The latter was the result of insufficient development at depth\nand northwest of the Mosquito Fault.\nIn 1984, Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd. optioned the property but dropped it after earning a 10%\ninterest. Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd. sold its interest back to Mosquito Creek Gold, and\nPeregrine sold its 50% interest to Mosquito.\nIn 1986, the property was optioned by Hecla Mining Company of Canada Ltd who conducted underground\nexploration work and then dropped it.\nMining operations were intermittent until 1987 when Mosquito Creek Gold became Mosquito Consolidated\nGold Mines Ltd. After the gold price dropped, and new mineralized material became hard to find, the mine\nclosed in 1987. During the period between 1980 and 1987, a total of 92,826 t of mineralized material were\nmined from which 35,054 oz of gold and 9,750 oz of silver were recovered (MINFILE number 093H 010).\nIn 1988, Lyon Lake Mines Ltd optioned the property and earned a 50% interest after performing\nunderground exploration.\nSurface Work Programs\nCariboo Gold Quartz Mining Company Ltd (1968)\nIn 1968, Dolmage Campbell and Associates Ltd carried out 5 km of bulldozer trenching on behalf of Cariboo\nGold Quartz Mining.\nSeventeen (17) trenches approximately 2 m to 2.5 m deep were excavated across the Baker-Rainbow\ncontact over a strike length of 1.6 km on Island Mountain. Pyritic mineralization, 6 m long by 1 m wide, was\ndiscovered in Trench J.\n66\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nWharf Resources Ltd (1980-1981)\nIn 1972, Cariboo Gold Quartz Mining amalgamated with Coseka Resources Ltd to form a company with the\nname of the latter. In April 1973, Wharf Resources Ltd (formerly Plateau Metals and Industries)\namalgamated with French Exploration Ltd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coseka Resources).\nWharf Resources carried out surface drilling programs in 1980 and 1981 to search for near-surface\nmineralized material on the Cariboo and Island Mountain claim groups. A total of 7,010 m of percussion drilling\nand 1,219 m of diamond drilling were completed in 1980 and 1981.\nBlackberry Gold Resources Inc. (1988)\nIn 1987, Blackberry Gold Resources Inc. completed several work programs on the ARCH 1-4 claim group\nlocated on Cow and Richfield mountains. The objective of the work was to discover gold mineralization\nassociated with the system of north-striking fault structures. Ground VLF geophysical surveys were used\nto define conductors inferred to be the strike extension of major faults on the Cariboo Group of Crown-\ngranted mineral claims. Four strong conductive trends were tested along six fences of percussion drill holes\nfor a total of 2,424 m of drilled in 79 holes. This was followed by 2,465 m of diamond drilling in 19 holes.\nPan Orvana Resources Inc. (1989-1991)\nOn July 12, 1985, Mosquito Creek Gold purchased the Cariboo and Island Mountain claim groups from\nWharf Resources Ltd, Pan Orvana Resources Ltd signed the Cariboo Gold Option Agreement on May 20,\n1988, obtaining the right to earn a 50% interest in the Cariboo Group, but terminated the agreement in 1991\nwithout exercising the option.\nPan Orvana Resources Ltd excavated 20 surface trenches, drilled four (4) holes and conducted ground\ngeophysical surveys, geochemical sampling programs and geological mapping.\nGold City Mining Corp. (1994-1995)\nIn 1994 and 1995, Gold City Mining assembled a large land position consisting of 13,000 ha of mineral titles\nbetween Mount Tom and the Cariboo Hudson Mine to form the Welbar Gold Project.\nDoing so involved seven (7) option agreements, including one that covered the Mosquito Creek, Island\nMountain and Cariboo claim groups. The latter was subject to the Cariboo Option Agreement between\nMosquito Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd and International Wayside Gold Mines Ltd. lntera Information\nTechnologies Corp. flew a synthetic aperture radar survey in July 1995. DIGHEM I Power completed a\nregional airborne radiometric- Mag-EM survey of 1,280 line-km, as well as trenching and diamond drilling\non some of their properties, including one (1) hole on the Mosquito Creek Group.\nFrom October 1 to November 30, 1995, Gold City Mining conducted a 13-hole (1,865 m) diamond drilling\nprogram on the Cariboo-Hudson Property.\nGold City Mining optioned the Cariboo-Hudson Property from Cathedral Gold Corp. in 1994.\nIn November 1995, Gold City Mining sunk four (4) diamond drill holes (560 m) on the Williams Creek\nProperty. That same month, Gold City Mining drilled two (2) holes (390 m) on the Island Mountain Property.\nInternational Wayside Gold Mines Ltd (1999-2014)\nFrom 1999 to 2014, IWGM drilled 66 holes totaling 8,602 m in surface diamond drilling on the Island\nMountain Project.\n67\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nInternational Wayside Gold Mines Ltd (1995-2009)\n1995-1999 Work Programs\nIWGM worked the Cariboo Project area continuously from May 1, 1995. Most of the work was carried out\non the main mine trend, either from the surface or underground from the 1200 level adit. In 1998 and 1999,\na secondary target, the BC Vein, was explored over a strike length of 384 m by 31 surface drill holes totaling\n2,245.2 m. Between 1995 and 1999, IWGM’s drilled 104 holes totaling 7,349.4m in surface diamond drilling,\n17 holes totaling 654.1m in underground diamond drilling and 135 holes totaling 5,739.9m in underground\npercussion drilling over the Rainbow, Pinkerton, Sanders, Butts and BC Vein zones.\nIn the summer of 1997, IWGM carried out a geochemical and prospecting program to find new mineralized\nshowings and generate targets for further exploration. The geochemical surveys yielded 1,079 soil samples,\n59 stream sediment samples and 121 rock samples.\nThe 1999 Estimate comprised measured resources of 7,158,100 t at 2.43 g/t Au for a total of 559,200 oz\nof gold, indicated resources of 1,394,300 t at 2.02 g/t Au for a total of 90,500 oz of gold, and inferred\nresources of 802,000 t at 2.06 g/t Au for a total of 53,100 oz of gold.\nThese “resources” are historical in nature and should not be relied upon. The qualified person has not done\nsufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. It is\nunlikely they comply with current NI 43-101 requirements or follow CIM Definition Standards, and their\nrelevance and reliability have not been verified. They are included in this section for illustrative purposes\nonly and the Corporation is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources.\n2000-2009 Work Programs\nIWGM carried out extensive work from 2000 to 2009. During this period, IWGM drilled 336 holes totalling\n47,222 m in surface diamond drilling over the BC Vein (88 holes), Bonanza Ledge (121 holes), Cow\nMountain (29 holes), Myrtle Property (14 holes), Golfinch (6 holes), Goldfinch and Bonanza Ledge (10\nholes), Black Bull (3 holes), Mucho Oro (31 holes), Lowhee Creek (2 holes) as well as 7 groundwater\nmonitoring well holes. In addition, from 2003 to 2004, IWGM drilled 76 holes totalling 6,177.4 m in\nunderground diamond drilling over the Bonanza Ledge zone.\nBarkerville Gold Mines Ltd (2010-2014)\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Barkerville engaged in surface diamond drilling on the Cariboo Project and drilled a\ntotal of 318 holes (73,700.1 metres). Drilling was done on Bonanza Ledge, Cow Mountain, Island Mountain,\nPit Vein Zeon, BC Vein, Souts Gulch and Myrtle Property zones. Details of the work program are set out in\nthe Cariboo Technical Report.\nBarkerville Gold Mines Ltd (2015-2019)\nDuring 2015, Barkerville milled 11,275 tonnes of Bonanza Ledge mineralized material at an average head\ngrade of 10.14 g/t Au, a recovery rate of 94%, and an average net operating cost of $877/oz. Based on the\nresults as of February 28, 2015, management decided to cease production and place Bonanza Ledge under\ncare and maintenance.\nThese “resources” are historical in nature and should not be relied upon. The qualified person has not done\nsufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. It is\nunlikely they comply with current NI 43-101 requirements or follow CIM Definition Standards, and their\nrelevance and reliability have not been verified.

Material sorting was done at the stockpile, producing relatively high-grade\npre-concentrate. By the end of February 2017, Barkerville had transported 2,860 t to the QR Mill for an\naverage grade of 2.94 g/t Au. During the second quarter of 2017, Barkerville began portal and underground\ndevelopment at the Bonanza Ledge Mine to prepare for the processing of in-situ Bonanza Ledge material.\nA total of 470 m of underground development was completed in 2017, resulting in the processing of\napproximately 7,000 t of both low-and higher-grade development material at the QR Mill for commissioning\nand training purposes.\nIn 2015, Snowden Mining Industry Consultants Pty prepared the 2015 Estimate for Cow Mountain using the\nmultiple indicator kriging method and all of Barkerville’s drill hole data available by the end of September\n2014. The 2015 Estimate was reported at a cut-off grade of 0.50 g/t Au demonstrated an indicated mineral\nresource of 35.6 Mt of 2.4 Au g/t and 2.8 Au Moz and inferred mineral resource of 27.5 Mt at 2.3 Au g/t and\n2.0 Au Moz. This estimate was based on the results of a Whittle pit optimization to a depth of 1,000 ft (304.8\nm) below the surface, around the underground workings of the Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine. The effective\ndate of the 2015 Estimate is March 31, 2015.\nThese “resources” are historical in nature and should not be relied upon.

The\nordinary kriging grade interpolation method was used. The results of the in situ 2018 MRE at the 3.0 g/t cut-\noff grade indicates a total measured and indicated resource of 8,109,900 t at 6.1 Au g/t and 1,599,000 Au\n(Oz) and total inferred of 12,731,200 t at 5.2 Au g/t and 2,155,700 Au (Oz).

The Omineca rocks were complexly deformed by Middle Jurassic to Early Tertiary\ncompressional tectonics, and by Tertiary transtension and extension. The Kootenay Terrane in the vicinity\nof the Cariboo Project is subdivided into the eastern Cariboo and western Barkerville subterranes. The\nCariboo Subterrane is juxtaposed on the Barkerville Subterrane by the east-dipping Pleasant Valley Thrust.\nThe Snowshoe Group, central to the Barkerville Subterrane, hosts the Cariboo Project.\nThe Barkerville and Cariboo subterranes comprise metamorphosed equivalents of continent-derived\nsiliciclastic protoliths with interlayered marble units and granitic orthogneiss. The subterranes are\npericratonic their character and are thought to have formed near the current western margin of Laurentia.\nVarious authors suggest that both Barkerville and Cariboo subterranes share the same tectostratigraphic\nposition and depositional environment.\nThe principal gold-producing areas in the Barkerville Subterrane are in areas of greenschist-grade\nmetamorphism (chlorite grade) and do not extend into amphiboIite-grade domains. The S1 and S2 fabrics\nare defined by metamorphic muscovite, quartz, albite, chlorite and locally biotite, and its character is\ngoverned by rock type. The metamorphic micas generally define foliation suggesting that peak metamorphic\ntemperature coincided with the formation of cleavage.\nLode-gold mineralization on the Cariboo Project shares many characteristics with orogenic gold deposits.\nGold mineralization is associated with orogenic silica-carbonate-sericite-pyrite stable fluids moving along\nsecondary permeability induced by the interaction of metamorphic fabrics, sublayer-parallel strike-slip\nfaults, contacts between lithological units, and rheological contrasts between lithologies.\nThe mineralization is defined in the Cow-Island-Barkerville Mountain Corridor. The Cow/Island segment\ncovers a strike length of 3.7 km and a width of approximately 700 m, down to a vertical depth of 600 m\nbelow surface. The Barkerville segment covers a strike length of 3km and a width of approximately 700 m,\ndown to a vertical depth of 500 m below surface.\nFive inter-related styles of mineralization are observed on the Cariboo Project:\n1. Fault-fill breccia veins subparallel to foliation (S1), hosted in carbonaceous mudstone (BC Vein\nstyle);\n2. Vertical NE-trending extensional (axial planar) veins dominantly hosted in sandstone units in S3\ncleavages (Cow Mountain, Shaft Zone, Mosquito Creek, Lowhee Zone and KL Zone vein\nmineralization);\n3. Fractured moderately dipping ENE-trending shear veins, hosted in sandstone units (Cow\nMountain, Shaft Zone, Mosquito Creek, Lowhee Zone and KL Zone vein mineralization);\n4. Gold-bearing sulphide replacements hosted in fold hinges of calcareous sandstone units (Island\nMountain and Mosquito Creek Replacement Style);\n5. Gold-bearing sulphide replacement mineralization hosted in fault-bounded calcareous siltstone\nunits (Bonanza Ledge style).\nVein mineralogy is largely simple, composed predominantly of quartz and lesser iron carbonate gangue.\nPyrite is the dominant sulphide mineral with vein content ranging from trace amounts to tens of percent. Pyrite\ncontent appears to have a direct association with gold content in the veins. Although galena and\narsenopyrite can also occur in individual veins in amounts up to several percent, these minerals generally\noccur in trace amounts as does sphalerite, chalcopyrite, argentite and scheelite. Generally increasing\n72\n328031.00001/116753121.9\namounts of galena and argentite are related to elevated silver values. At least two sulphide events are\nobserved in veins: one early event inter-grown with quartz and a secondary event infilling pre-existing void\nspaces or vein margins. The bismuth-lead sulphosalt cosalite also occurs in isolated veins and appears to\nbe associated with high-grade gold independent of pyrite content. Cosalite is only observed as intergrowths\nwith quartz and its timing is considered early.\nReplacement mineralization in calcareous sandstones varies from fine to coarse-grained pyrite with lesser\narsenopyrite. Bonanza Ledge replacement mineralization, hosted in calcareous siltstone, consists entirely\nof fine-grained pyrite mineralized material. Sulphide content in replacement mineralized material types is\ngenerally high, ranging from 10% (replacing thin calcareous bands) to massive (replacing entire beds). The\ntiming relationship for observed mineralization types is considered to be contemporaneous, with vertical\nveins acting as feeders for the fault fill veins, replacement horizons and earlier shear veins.\nLarge veins tend to exhibit a strong silica alteration halo with pyrite contents that range from several percent\nto massive. Farther from the large veins, the pyrite content drops to trace amounts with intense silicification.\nMost smaller veins have strong silica with trace pyrite proximal to vein margins; they rarely show the\nmassive pyrite deposition exhibited in larger veins. A widespread moderate silica envelope with patchy but\nintense silica closer to the veins is observed within the vein corridors. More distal from the vein corridors,\nthe intensity of silica alteration becomes weak, and sericite is the dominant alteration mineral with an iron\ncarbonate halo outside of the sericite. Localized veins show argillic and chloritic alteration within the vertical\naxial planar veins.\nExploration\nBarkerville’s exploration team carried out exploration work on the Cariboo Project from May to December\n2019. The program consisted of geological mapping and surface rock sampling, followed by interpretation\nand the preparation of an internal mapping report. Mapping and sampling efforts specifically targeted the\nnorthwest and southeast strike extensions of the known mineralization and defined resources in the Wells\narea, as well as a parallel trend at Mount Burns (Lightning Creek Trend).\nGeological mapping\nThe principal aims of the 2019 regional mapping program were to expand the coverage of Barkerville\n1:2,000-scale mapping within the prospective sandstone of the Barkerville Trend in an effort to delineate\ngreenfield exploration targets and provide recommendations for the targeting methodology.\nMapping was carried out over 19 weeks during the late-May to early-October field season, with data\ninterpretation spanning into December. The field component of the program consisted of detailed geological\nmapping and surface structural data collection carried out across approximately 2,900 ha within the\nBarkerville Trend, split between the Island Mountain and Proserpine prospects. The focus of late-season\nmapping shifted to the Lightning Creek trend, exposed at Mount Burns.\nA total of 200 surface samples or various types (grab, select, panel, linear) were collected in 2019 across all\nmapping areas, as summarized in Table 4. The mapping and sampling confirmed the extension of the\ncorridors and allowed Barkerville to develop drilling targets.\nTable 4 - 2019 Cariboo Project surface rock samples\nSelect\nGrab Mineralized\nProspect Samples Samples Panel Samples Linear Samples Total Samples\nAntler Creek 2 0 0 0 2\nMount Burns 4 8 0 0 12\nIsland Mtn 11 53 2 0 66\n73\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nSelect\nGrab Mineralized\nProspect Samples Samples Panel Samples Linear Samples Total Samples\nProserpine Mtn 35 78 6 1 120\nTotal 52 139 8 1 200\nDrilling\nBarkerville is continuously drilling on the property and the drilling was still ongoing at the time of the report.\nThe drilling performed from January to December 2019 was included in the Cariboo Technical Report and\nis defined as the “2019 Program” and the potential impact on the Cariboo Technical Report is presented\nbelow for the drilling completed to date. The objectives were to test new brownfields targets adjacent to\nknown deposits, infill high-grade MSO stopes modelled from the PEA and currently classified as inferred,\nexplore the depth potential of known deposits, and continue exploration on regional targets. Diamond drill\ncore is the principal source of geological information for the Cariboo Project.\nDrilling Methodology\nThe 2019 Program was performed by Hy-Tech Drilling Ltd, based in Smithers, British Columbia. Collar\nlocations were determined using a Trimble DGPS.\nDrills were lined up using a Reflex TN14 Gyrocompass or a Suunto compass. The downhole dip and\nazimuth were surveyed using a Reflex EZ-shot tool. Surveys started 10 m below the casing, and readings\nwere taken at least every 30 m downhole. A reading was also taken at the bottom of the hole if the EOH\ndepth was 15 m or more from the last test. A multi-shot survey was performed in exploration holes upon\ncompletion. Drilling contractors handled the instruments, and survey information was transcribed and\nprovided in paper format to Barkerville geologists. Starting in January 2019, survey information was also\ncopied from the instruments to USB drives and transferred into the Barkerville Database.\nAt the drill rig, the drill helpers placed core into core boxes and marked off every 3-m drill run using a labelled\nwooden block. Oriented core measurements were taken for all exploration holes, but stopped for most infill\nholes from July 2019 onward. The drill helpers were responsible for marking the core using a Reflex Act III\ntool. All holes were drilled in NQ diametre unless noted otherwise in this report.\nCore Logging Procedures\nThe drill core was transported to Barkerville’s facility in Wells where it was cleaned of drilling additives and\nmud, and the metres were marked before collecting the data.\nGeotechnical data collection includes RQD at 1-m intervals. Magnetic susceptibility data were not collected\nbecause it was concluded that such data are not relevant to the deposit. Geotechnicians performed\nhardness testing on all core.\nDownhole orientation lines were connected where possible, and orientation measurements recorded.\nAll data were recorded using Datamine DHLogger software. Sample intervals and pertinent information\nregarding lithology, mineralization and alteration were marked on the core.\nAfter recording the sampling information, drill core samples were sawn in half, labelled, and bagged. The\nremaining drill core is stored onsite in a secured location for future reference. Numbered security tags were\napplied to lab shipments for chain of custody requirements. Samples were then shipped to the laboratory\nof ALS Minerals in North Vancouver, British Columbia, for analysis.\n74\n328031.00001/116753121.9\n2019 Drilling Program\nThe 2019 Program focused on the Cow–Island–Barkerville Corridor, as well as Proserpine Mountain.\nBarkerville drilled 92,297 m in 264 surface holes at an average recovery rate of 96%. A summary of the\ndrilling program is presented in Table 5.\nTable 5 - Summary of Barkerville’s 2019 Program\nDeposit / Prospect Total metres Number of Holes\nBCV 3,744 24\nBM 36,376 87\nLZ 8,422 24\nWC 1,572 4\nCM 16,137 72\nMC 8,259 15\nSZ 12,032 26\nWLO 3,079 6\nPSP 2,676 6\nTotals 92,297 264\nThe 2019 Program at Island Mountain focused on the Shaft Zone, Mosquito Creek and the Willow Regional\nTarget, totaling 23,370 m in 47 holes.\nThe drilling conducted at Shaft Zone and Mosquito Creek continued the category conversion work and\nfollowed up on the results from 2018 to expand known mineralized vein corridors. The Shaft Zone (12,032\nm, 26 holes) was explored and defined from surface to a maximum vertical depth of 750 m, while drilling at\nMosquito Creek (8,259 m, 15 holes) targeted shallow modelled vein corridors to a maximum vertical depth of\n370 m and replacement-style mineralized zones. Infill drilling on these two deposits was designed to\nintercept modelled vein corridors with a 25-m spacing at depth in order to convert inferred resources to\nindicated.\nDrilling at the Willow prospect tested the 2017 gold-in-soil anomalies in the northwest area of Island\nMountain and followed up on 2018 mapping recommendations. Two (2) stratigraphic holes were drilled at\nan azimuth of 225° followed by four (4) holes drilled at an azimuth between 120° and 130° to test surface\nanomalies, for a total of six (6) drill holes and 3,079 m.\nThe 2019 Program at Cow Mountain continued the category conversion work on known vein corridors\n(inferred to indicated) and explored the down-dip extent of selected targets. The targeted vein corridors were\ndrilled from surface to a maximum vertical depth of 280 m with a 25-m intercept spacing at depth. A total of\n16,137 m was drilled in 72 holes. No new holes were drilled on the Valley deposit during the 2019 Program.\nThe aim of the 2019 Program at Barkerville Mountain was to provide infill data on the BC Vein and to explore\ntargets identified during the 2018 mapping program on the KL Zone, Williams Creek, and Lowhee Zone\nprospects. Historical drilling and surface geochemical data also contributed to the generation of these\nexploration targets.\nBC Vein drilling, totaling 3,744 m in 23 holes, improved block model confidence and further delineated the\ndeposit. Drilling at the three exploration prospects targeted mineralized vein corridors within the prospective\n75\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nsandstone unit analogous to those on the Cow and Island mountains. In total, 86 holes (36,250 m) were\ndrilled on the KL prospect, four (4) holes (1,572 m) on the Williams Creek prospect, and 24 holes (8,422\nm) on the Lowhee prospect.\nAt the Proserpine prospect, a single drill rig tested surface geochemical results and the down-dip extent of\nmineralization reported from historical workings. One (1) stratigraphic hole was drilled at an azimuth of 210°,\nfollowed by five (5) holes drilled at 120° azimuth to intersect the anomalies. Six (6) drill holes were completed\nfor 2,676 m.\nNo geotechnical or metallurgical holes were drilled in 2019.\nFull details on the 2019 Program can be found in the Cariboo Technical Report.\n2020 Drilling Program\nParallel to the Cariboo Technical Report, which includes all drilling to the end of 2019, Barkerville drilled a\ntotal of 57,078 meters in 201 holes in 2020. The 2020 Program again focuses on the Cow-Island-Barkerville\nCorridor. Barkerville has currently drilled 25,397.7 metres in 82 holes at an average recovery rate of 97%\n(as of September 28, 2020). A summary of the Drilling Program is presented in Table 6.\nTable 6 - Summary of Barkerville’s 2020 Program\nNUMBER OF\nDEPOSIT METRES DRILLED\nHOLES\nBC VEIN AND BONANZA LEDGE 3 560.60\nLOWHEE ZONE 24 10,144.50\nCOW MOUNTAIN 48 12,596.05\nVALLEY ZONE 56 17,558.85\nSHAFT ZONE 15 3,909.00\nMOSQUITO CREEK 50 9,392.40\nPROSERPINE 5 2,917.40\nTOTAL 201 57,078.80\nThe 2020 drilling has been focused in the Valley Zone to continue the category conversion work, expand\nknown mineralized vein corridors, and follow up on results from the 2018 MRE. The targeted vein corridors\nare being drilled from surface to a maximum vertical depth of 825 m with a 25-m intercept spacing at depth.\nA total of 17,558.85m were drilled in 56 holes.\nThe 2020 Program at Cow Mountain continued the category conversion work on known vein corridors\n(inferred to indicated) and explored the down-dip extent of selected targets. The targeted vein corridors were\ndrilled from surface to a maximum vertical depth of 350 m with a 25-m intercept spacing at depth. A total of\n12,596.05 meters were drilled in 48 holes.\nThe aim of the 2020 Program at Barkerville Mountain was to provide infill data on the BC Vein and to further\ndefine the Lowhee Zone prospect.\nBC Vein drilling, totaling 560.60 m in 3 holes, improved block model confidence and further delineated the\ndeposit. Drilling at the Lowhee Zone targeted mineralized vein corridors within the prospective sandstone\nunit analogous to those on Cow and Island mountains. The targeted vein corridors were drilled from surface\nto a maximum vertical depth of 370 m with a 50-m intercept spacing at depth. A total of 10,144.50 m were\ndrilled in 24 holes.\n76\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nThe 2020 Program at Island Mountain has so far consisted of 15 holes drilled at Shaft Zone for a total of\n3,909 m. Further drilling at Shaft Zone is set to continue in the winter of 2020 and will continue the category\nconversion work.\nBarkerville’s 2020 Drilling Program was paused from March through June 2020 due to COVID-19.\nThe intersections were visually compared in 3D to the mineralized zones 3D solids and interpolated block\ngrades of the 2020 MRE.\nOverall, the visual inspection of the 2020 drilling results demonstrated that the thickness and the grade of\nthe mineralized zones are in the same order of magnitude as the 2020 MRE. The 2020 drilling continues\nto confirm the geological and grade continuities that were demonstrated in the 2020 MRE.\nFor the purpose of the Cariboo Technical Report, InnovExplo is of the opinion that the gains and the losses\nwould balance each other, and the resulting difference would not be material to the overall resource.\nAccording to the drilling results in the extension of the known mineralized zones and with the discovery of\nnew zones, there is a potential to increase the mineral resources.\n2021 Exploration activities\nA total of 152,500 meters were drilled in 2021 on the Cariboo Gold Project as part of the exploration and\ncategory conversion drill program to support the ongoing technical work. The drilling commenced in January\n2021 and was completed in October with up to 12 diamond drill rigs utilized during the campaign. By deposit,\na total of 61,000 meters were drilled at Shaft, 50,000 meters at Valley, and 30,000 meters at Lowhee and\n10,000 meters at Mosquito. An additional 1,500 meters were drilled at QR. The drilling confirmed down dip\nextensions of mineralized vein corridors and high-grade intercepts within the current mineral resource\nestimate. The mineral resource estimate incorporates eight deposit areas; the Shaft and Mosquito Creek\ndeposits on Island Mountain, Cow and Valley deposits on Cow Mountain, and Lowhee, KL, BC Vein and\nBonanza Ledge deposits on Barkerville Mountain at a cut-off grade of 2.1 g/t Au (“grams per metric tonne”).\nThe cut off for Bonanza Ledge Deposit is 3.5 g/t Au. The objective of the 2021 exploration and delineation\nprogram is to convert inferred resources to indicated resources to support reserves for the ongoing\nadvanced technical studies and to increase overall ounces in the inferred and indicated resource categories\nby exploring the depth and strike potential of the known deposits.\nSample Preparation, Analyses and Security\nThe following paragraphs describe the sample preparation, analysis, and security procedures for all drill\nprograms including in the current resource estimate. InnovExplo reviewed the QA/QC procedures and\nresults.\nCore Handling, Sampling and Security\nCore handling, sampling, and security procedures are managed by Barkerville personnel. The procedures\nare described in detail below.\nThe drill core is placed into wooden core boxes at the drill site with the end of each drill run marked with a\nsmall wooden block displaying the depth of the hole. Box labels indicate the hole and box numbers. The\nboxes are racked and covered at the drill, secured with ratchet straps, and then transported daily from the\ndrill site to Barkerville’s core storage and logging facility by truck by the drilling contractor. The boxes are\nlabelled in permanent marker with the hole and box number (e.g. GR-15-01 Bx 1). The secure core storage\nand logging facility is located in the town of Wells.\nUpon receiving a load of core from the drill crew, the core is brought into the logging room. Metreage blocks\nare checked for errors, the core is oriented in the box and cleaned, and the metre-marks are drawn on the\n77\n328031.00001/116753121.9\ncore before logging begins. The geological and geotechnical core logging data is collected with Datamine’s\nDHLogger software.\nThe sample intervals are between 0.5 m and 1.5 m in length and do not cross geological contacts. A line is\ndrawn with a pencil along the length of the core to indicate where the core will be sawn. Each sampling\nticket is divided into three tags. One tag is stapled to the core box at the beginning of the interval to record\nthe drill hole number and sample interval recorded. The second tag is placed in the sample bag, which is\nsent to the laboratory; this tag does not reference the drill hole or metreage. The last tag remains in the\nsample ticket book with the hole number and recorded interval. All samples are assigned a unique sample\nnumber.\nAfter the core boxes with tags are photographed, the core boxes are moved to the cutting station. The core is\ncut lengthwise by diamond saw, with half the core submitted as the primary sample and the remaining half\ncore retained in the core box for future reference.\nThe sample are individually bagged with the corresponding tag. The tag number is written on the bag and\nevery bag is sealed. The bags are then placed on rice bags and the rice bags are sealed with numbered\nsecurity tags for chain of custody requirements. If any tampering with security tags is suspected, the\nlaboratory will communicate with Barkerville. Samples are transported to the ALS lab in Vancouver by Van\nKam transport trucking service. The remaining drill core is subsequently stored on site at Barkerville’s\nsecure facility in Wells, British Columbia.\nLaboratories Accreditation and Certification\nThe ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission (“IEC”) form the specialized system for\nworldwide standardization. ISO/IEC 17025 General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and\nCalibration Laboratories sets out the criteria for laboratories wishing to demonstrate that they are technically\ncompetent, operating an effective quality system, and able to generate technically valid calibration and test\nresults. The standard forms the basis for the accreditation of competence of laboratories by accreditation\nbodies. ISO 9001 applies to management support, procedures, internal audits and corrective actions. It\nprovides a framework for existing quality functions and procedures.\nAll the samples of the 2019 Program were submitted to the ALS Minerals laboratory in British Columbia.\nThe ALS Minerals laboratory is ISO 9001 certified and accredited (ISO/IEC 17025) for the analytical\nmethods used routinely on the samples from the Cow, Island and Barkerville Mountains. The ALS Minerals\nfacility is a commercial laboratory independent of Barkerville and has no interest in the Cariboo Project.\nSample Preparation and Assay\nSample Preparation\n• Samples are sorted and logged into the ALS Minerals LIMS program.\n• Samples are dried and weighed.\n• Samples are crushed to +70% passing 2 mm (CRU-31).\n• The crushed sample split of up to 500 g is pulverized to +85% passing 75 μm screen (PUL 32m).\n• Samples containing visible gold or cosalite mineralization are assayed by metallic screen method; a\ncrushed sample split of 1,000 g is pulverized (method PUL-32) to pass 100 μm (Tyler 150 mesh)\nstainless steel screen to separate the oversize fractions (method SCR-21).\nGold Assaying\n• A 50-g pulp aliquot is analyzed by Au-AA26: fire assay followed by aqua regia digestion (HNO3\nHCl) with an ASS.\n• When assay results are higher than 100 g/t Au, a second 50-g pulp aliquot is analysed by Au-‐\nGRA22: fire assay, parting with nitric acid (HNO3) with a gravimetric finish.\n78\n328031.00001/116753121.9\n• All samples containing visible gold or cosalite mineralization are assayed by the metallic screen\nmethod (method Au-SCR21). At the request of Barkerville, any sample exceeding 100 g/t Au (Au-\nAA26) is rerun with the screen method following the procedure below.\n• For visible gold assays or cosalite mineralization, the +100 μm fraction (Au+) is analyzed in its\nentirety by FA with gravimetric finish. The 100 μm fraction (minus) is homogenized and two (2)\nsubsamples are analyzed by FA with atomic absorption spectroscopy (Au-AA25) or gravimetric\nfinish (Au-GRA21). The average of the two (2) minus fraction subsamples are taken and reported\nas the Au- fraction result. The gold content is then determined by the weighted average of the Au+\nand Au- fractions.\nMulti-element Assaying\n• Some samples are analyzed by trace-level multi-element method ME MS61: a 0.25-g aliquot is\ndigested by four-acid digestion (HNO3 HClO4 HF HCl) and HCl leach (method GEO-4A01) and\nanalyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscop‐y; an analytical technique\nused for the detection of chemical elem‐ents. ‐ ‐\n• Following this analysis, the results are reviewed for high concentrations of bismuth, mercury,\nmolybdenum, silver and tungsten and diluted accordingly.\nSamples meeting these criteria are then analyzed by ICP-MS. Results are corrected for spectral\ninterelement interferences.\nSpecific Gravity Measurements\n• Before crushing and pulverizing, the specific gravity of selected samples is determined by the\nbulk sample method (water displacement, OA GRA08).\nQuality Assurance and Quality Control\nA total of 84,039 samples (including QA/QC samples) were assayed during 2019 for the 2020 MRE. The\n2019 QA/QC program included a routine insertion of standards and blanks. Barkerville included one (1)\nstandard in every 20 samples and one (1) blank in every 40 samples. The 2019 QA/QC program did not\ninclude field or coarse reject duplicates.\nAccuracy is monitored by adding standards at the rate of one CRM for every 20 samples. A total of 4,202\nstandards were analyzed during the 2019 Program, for an insertion rate of 5.0%. Eight different CRMs from\nmineralized material Research and Exploration Pty Ltd (ore assay standards were used). The average CRM\nresults are all within ±1.5% of the expected values. Most assays were within ±3 standard deviations of the\naccepted value.\nIn 2019, 2,101 blanks were submitted to ALS Minerals with the core samples. All the blanks analyzed at\nALS Minerals, except for the one high failure, assayed less than or equal to 0.1 g/t Au, which is 10 times\nthe detection limit of 0.01 g/t Au, and are thus considered acceptable.\nConclusions\nA total of 256 holes were drilled in 2019 on the Cariboo Project. InnovExplo is of the opinion that the sample\npreparation, analysis, QA/QC and security protocols used for the Cariboo Project follow generally accepted\nindustry standards, and that the data is valid.\nData Verification\nInnovExplo’s data verification included the diamond drill hole databases used for the Cariboo Technical\nReport, as well as the review and validation of the geological models of each deposits, and the review of\n79\n328031.00001/116753121.9\ninformation on mined-out areas and the data for selected drill holes (assays, QA/QC program, downhole\nsurveys, lithologies, alteration and structures).\nThe QPs also reviewed and validated the resource estimation process followed by Barkerville and Talisker\nExploration Services Inc., including all parametres, geological interpretation, basic statistics, variography,\ninterpolation parametres, block model construction, scripts that run the model, volumetric report, and the\nvalidation process.\nHistorical work subject to verification consisted of the holes used for the 2019 MRE. Basic cross-check\nroutines were performed between the current Barkerville Databases and the previously validated database\nfor the 2019 MRE.\nInnovExplo was granted access to the assay certificates for all holes in the 2019 drilling programs. Assays\nwere verified for 5% of the drill holes. No discrepancies were found.\nBarkerville Drill Hole Collar and Downhole Surveys\nThe 2019 surface drill hole collars in the resource area were surveyed using a Trimble DGPS unit.\nInnovExplo 2019 verifications included a visit to an active drill site.\nDownhole surveys (single shot and multi shots) were conducted on the majority of surface holes. The Reflex\nsurvey information was verified for 5% of the holes from the latest drilling programs. No discrepancies were\nfound.\nAssays\nThe author had access to the assay certificates for all historical and current holes in the Barkerville\nDatabases. All assays were verified for selected drill holes from the latest drilling program, i.e., 5% of the\n2019 drilling program. The assays recorded in the databases were compared to the original certificates\nfrom ALS Minerals (North Vancouver, British Columbia). The electronic transfer of the laboratory results via\ne-mail, followed by the electronic transfer directly into the databases by Barkerville staff, allowed for\nimmediate error detection and prevented any typing errors.\nNo errors or discrepancies were found. The final databases are considered to be of good overall quality.\nInnovExplo considers the Barkerville Databases to be valid and reliable.\nDiscussions and reviews with Barkerville personnel during video conferencing convinced the author that\nthe protocols and the QA/QC program in place are adequate.\nMined-out Voids\nNo underground activities were carried out in 2019. The 2019 voids model for Bonanza Ledge (all types of\nhistorical underground workings combined; see below) remains current and was used for the Cariboo\nTechnical Report.\nFor the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, KL, Lowhee and BC Vein & Splays deposits, the drilling program\ncontinues to intercept undocumented voids. To reduce the associated risk, a spherical buffer with a 10-m\nradius was applied around the intercepts to represent a potential stope of 20 m in diametre. These \"buffer\nvoids\" were used to deplete the final resource estimate.\nThe voids are a combination of the historical underground workings (stopes, drifts and shafts) of the Cariboo\nGold Quartz Mine (Cow Mountain), the Aurum and Mosquito Creek mines (Island Mountain), and the\nBarkerville Mountain Mine (Barkerville Mountain).\n80\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nInnovExplo considers the level of detail in the void triangulation to be of good quality and reliable, despite\nsome uncertainty related to previously undocumented voids.\nBarkerville Logging, Sampling and Assaying Procedures\nInnovExplo reviewed several sections of the mineralized core by comparing core photographs, drill logs\nand the database.\nMineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing\nSample Selection and Compositing\nIn 2019, BBA, Osisko and Barkerville developed a metallurgical testwork program to characterize the\nbehaviour of mineralized material from the Cariboo Project during mineral processing and extraction. It\nincluded composite samples composed of NQ diamond drill core obtained from the Shaft, Cow, Valley and\nMosquito zones during the 2016, 2017 and 2018 drilling programs. The results were presented in the 2019\nPEA.\nThe metallurgical testwork program was developed by BBA, Osisko Gold Royalties and BGM in order to\ncharacterize Cariboo Gold mineralized material behaviour to mineral processing and extraction processes.\nIt included composite samples from four zones; Shaft, Cow, Valley and Mosquito. The material for the\ncomposites was obtained from NQ drill core intervals from the diamond drill core of the drilling campaigns\nperformed by BGM in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nThe testwork program was designed to determine the mineralized material response to a preconcentration\nprocess and subsequently to the QR Mill process.\nThe selected mineralized intervals for the LOM composite included wall rock/shoulder samples from\nquartered NQ drill core and were separated on site into two size fractions: (-60 mm/+10 mm) sized material\nsent to Steinert in Kentucky, USA for mineral sorting testwork; and (-25 mm) sized material sent to SGS\nBurnaby, British Columbia, for compositing for metallurgical testwork.\nA single composite of fines (-25 mm) fraction was prepared at SGS by blending the material from each\nzone to represent the expected LOM distribution. The testwork for the fines (-25 mm) fraction involved\nmineralized material characterization, grindability, gravity and flotation. Mineral sorting pre-concentration\nproducts received from Steinert were also blended to create composites, representing the expected LOM\ndistribution and individual mineralized zones. Cyanide leaching response of pre-concentrates from both the\nmineral sorting and flotation samples were tested individually. A bulk sample representing the QR Mill feed\nblend of mineral sorter concentrate and flotation concentrate was prepared for leach optimization.\nDrill core intervals for variability composites that represented Gold grade variation of each mineralized zone\nwere selected by BGM, Osisko and BBA and sent to SGS for a second metallurgical testwork campaign.\nThe material received for the variability testwork program was 1,243 kg from Shaft Zone, 728 kg from Cow\nZone and 180 kg from Valley Zone (Table 13-2). The drill core intervals received were crushed to -35 mm\nand screened. The coarse fraction (-35+10 mm) of the material was sent to Steinert for mineral sorting\ntestwork. (-10 mm) sized material was kept at SGS for metallurgical testwork. Mineral sorting products\nreceived back from Steinert were assayed and prepared for metallurgical testwork at SGS.\nComminution Testwork\nSamples were submitted to crusher work index, Bond ball mill work index and abrasion index testing at\nSGS.\n81\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nMineral Sorting Testwork\nMineral sorting testwork was conducted at Steinert facilities in Kentucky, USA, in August 2018. The initial\ntestwork program focused on 1,264 kg of drill core material, from all four deposits, crushed to -60 mm/+10\nmm. The mineral sorting products of two samples from Shaft Zone and Cow Zone were recombined to\nreproduce the previously tested -60 mm/+10 mm feed, crushed to -35 mm/+10 mm and sent back to Steinert\nfor mineral sorting.\nThe second mineral sorting testwork program involved the variability samples from three mineralized\ndeposits. Ten variability samples sized -35 mm/+10 mm were mineral sorted at Steinert in January 2019.\nOnce the mineral sorting tests were completed, the mineral sorting products were sent to SGS for analysis\nalong with the -8 mm fines generated during mineral sorting due to sample handling.\nFlotation Testwork\nKinetic flotation tests were conducted on samples: fine fraction gravity tails, fine fraction of whole rock\ncomposites, OSC, and blend of mineral sorter concentrate with fines.\nThe gravity tails composites were produced from bulk gravity concentration tests, while the whole rock\nsamples consisted of the -25 mm fines. The effect of grind size on flotation performance at target P80\nvalues of 200, 150 and 100 microns was tested on these samples. Whole rock variability composites (SZ1,\nSZ2, SZ3 and SZ4) were tested at two target P80 values of 200 and 400 microns.\nMineral sorting concentrate of CZ and SZ variability samples were tested at 100 and 200 microns. The\nsame mineral sorter concentrate samples were blended with their generated fines and tested at 100 and\n200 microns.\nGravity Concentration\nGravity concentration tests were performed on the blend of mineral sorter concentrate and flotation\nconcentrate prior to leach tests. The samples were first subjected to gravity concentration using a lab scale\nKnelson concentrator and further concentrated with Mozley table. The average gold recovery was 28.1%.\nLeaching Testwork\nA leaching program was conducted and included flotation rougher concentrates, OSC and blended\nflotation/mineral sorter concentrates at 70:30, 50:50 and 30:70 of fines-to-coarse ratios. The fines-to-coarse\nproportion for operations has not yet been established, the testwork program was designed to cover a range\nof scenarios. The samples were prepared to a pulp density of 45% (w/w) solids, with the exception of the\nflotation rougher concentrate leach tests that were run at 35% (w/w) solids. All leaching tests were\nconducted at a target pH of 11 to 11.5 and dissolved oxygen levels of 6 ppm to 8 ppm.\nFines flotation concentrate, mineral sorter concentrate flotation concentrate and mineral sorter concentrate\nof variability composites were blended in proportions, which would represent the preconcentrate production\nand leached at 45 and 75 microns with and without pre-treatment.\nCyanide Destruction Testwork\nCyanide destruction testwork was performed on a bulk gravity tailings sample of the 50:50 (fines to coarse\nratio) blend of flotation concentrate and mineral sorter concentrate at Cyanco following cyanidation. To\nreduce the reagent consumption rates, a pre-aeration step added to leaching ahead of cyanide destruction.\nThe addition of the pre-aeration step reduced the cyanide consumption and the amount of total cyanide in\nleach tails by reducing the formation of stable metal cyanide complexes, which were suspected to be\n82\n328031.00001/116753121.9\ncyanide consumers, and as a result reduced the detox reagent consumption rates. Targeted cyanide levels\nwere successfully achieved with both conditions.\nThickening, Filtration and Rheology Testwork\nThree samples were sent to Pocock Industrial in Salt Lake City, Utah for thickening, filtration and rheology\ntesting; these included flotation tailings, pre-leach thickener feed and detoxed tailings.\nAll three samples were submitted to flocculant screening tests to identify the best reagent for flocculation\nof solids to promote rapid settling and reducing suspended solids concentration in overflow. The screening\ntests also provided an indication of the required reagent dosing. The selected flocculant for all three\nsamples was a high molecular weight, 10% charge anionic polyacrylamide.\nOnce an appropriate flocculant was selected, static settling tests were conducted to provide an estimate of\nthe optimized operating parametres, including feed slurry density and flocculant dosing, for dynamic testing.\nThe recommended flocculant dosing for dynamic testing ranged between 24 g/t and 36 g/t.\nDynamic thickening tests were performed on each material to determine the recommended maximum\nhydraulic design basis for high rate thickener design. Expected underflow solids concentrations and\noverflow suspended solids concentrations were also determined in testing.\nPre-Concentration Recovery and Mass Pull Projection\nThe average recovery and mass pull results presented in this section were for the preconcentrate blends\nprepared for the testwork program. The blends were prepared using a fixed proportion of each mineralized\nzone considering the preliminary mine plan at the time. Annual recovery projections are expected to differ\nfrom the average testwork results according to the final mine plan proportions of mineralized zones. The\naverage gold recovery and mass pull results from the testwork performed are summarized in Table 7. The\nprojected pre-concentrate transferred to the QR Mill is 21.2% of the Mine site feed mass and the overall\ngold recovery is 92.2%.\nTable 7 - Average gold recovery and mass pull for each process step\nAverage stage Average gold\nProcess step mass recovery (%) stage recovery (%)\nCrushing circuit fines 30.0 36.0\nCrushing circuit coarse 70.0 64.0\nFlotation concentrate 20.0 98.9\nCoarse mineral sorting concentrate 42.6 93.9\nPre-concentrate (QR feed) 21.2 95.3\nGravity NA 28.1\nLeaching of pre-concentrate NA 95.5\nOverall Au Recovery 92.2\nMineral Resource Estimate\nThe Cariboo Technical Report encompasses updated resources for the deposits of Cow Mountain (Cow),\nIsland Mountain (Shaft and Mosquito), and Barkerville Mountain (BC Vein (including the BC Vein Splays),\nKL and Lowhee). The updates were prepared by Talisker Exploration Services Inc., and reviewed and\n83\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nvalidated by InnovExplo, using all available information. No changes are reported for the Valley (Cow\nMountain) and the Bonanza Ledge (Barkerville Mountain) deposits.\nThe 2020 MRE relied on information from the 2019 exploration program. The effective date of the 2020\nMRE is April 28, 2020.\nMethodology\nThe 2020 MRE covers all the deposits in the Cow-Island-Barkerville Mountain Corridor. The resource area\nfor the Cow/Island segment covers a strike length of 3.7 km and a width of approximately 700 m, down to\na vertical depth of 600 m below surface. The estimate for the Barkerville segment covers a strike length of\n3 km and a width of approximately 700 m, down to a vertical depth of 500 m below surface.\nThe models for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL and Lowhee deposits were prepared\nusing LeapFrog GEO v.5.0.4. and Datamine. Leapfrog GEO v.5.0.4. was used for the modelling, which\nincluded the construction of 334 mineralized solids: 101 for Cow; 39 for Valley; 74 for Shaft; 50 for Mosquito;\n6 for BC Vein and five BC Vein splays; 40 for KL; and 24 for Lowhee. Datamine was used for the estimation,\nwhich consisted of 3D block modelling and the ordinary kriging interpolation method. Statistical studies,\ncapping and variography were completed using Datamine, GSLIB and Excel. Capping and validations were\ncarried out in Datamine and Microsoft Excel.\nThe Bonanza Ledge model was prepared using GEOVIA GEMS software v.6.7. Such software was used\nfor the modelling, which included the construction of one (1) mineralized solid, and for the estimation, which\nconsisted of 3D block modelling and ordinary kriging interpolation. Statistical studies and variography were\ndone using Snowden Supervisor v.8.6 software. Capping and several validations were carried out in\nMicrosoft Excel and Snowden Supervisor v.8.6 software.\nThe main steps in the methodology were as follows:\n• Compile and validate the diamond drill hole databases used for mineral resource estimation;\n• Validate the geological model and interpretation of the mineralized zones based on lithological and\nstructural information, historical underground mapping and general orientation of stopes, and metal\ncontent;\n• Validate the drill hole intercepts database, compositing database and capping values, for the\npurposes of geostatistical analysis and variography;\n• Validate the block models and grade interpolation;\n• Revise the classification criteria and validate the clipping areas for mineral resource classification;\n• Assess the resources with \"reasonable prospects for economic extraction\" and select appropriate\ncut-off grades; and\n• Generate a mineral resource statement.\nDrill Hole Database\nFour (4) diamond drill hole databases cover the Cariboo Project: Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley deposits),\nIsland Mountain (Shaft and Mosquito deposits), Barkerville Mountain (BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee deposits),\nand Bonanza Ledge. The Cow Mountain database contains 1,259 validated drill holes. The Island Mountain\ndatabase contains 1,321 validated drill holes. The Barkerville Mountain database contains 535 validated\nsurface DDH. The Bonanza Ledge database contains 213 validated holes.\nAll databases include lithological, alteration and structural descriptions taken from drill core logs. Oriented\ncore data have been available since the 2016 Program. The databases cover the strike length of each\nresource area at variable drill spacings, ranging from 10 to 60 m for the Cow, Island and Barkerville\nmountains deposits, and from 5-15 m for the Bonanza Ledge deposit.\n84\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nIn addition to the tables of raw data, each database includes several tables of calculated drill hole composites\nand wireframe solid intersections, which are required for the statistical evaluation and resource block\nmodelling.\nGeological Model\nBarkerville updated the 2020 geological models for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, and BC Vein deposits\nusing historical data, the data from the 2015-2018 drilling programs, and new holes from the 2019 drilling\nprogram. Barkerville also modelled two additional deposits, KL and Lowhee, using the new 2019 DDH data.\nThe Bonanza Ledge geological model was reviewed and validated by the QPs. No new data have been\nacquired at Bonanza Ledge since the technical report of Brousseau et al. (2017).\nA total of 335 geological solids were created and/or updated for all the deposits.\nThe Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, Lowhee, and KL geological models consist of 328 mineralized solids\nrepresenting axial planar veins. All geological solids were modelled in Leapfrog GEO v.5.0.4. The solids\nwere designed with a minimum thickness of 2 m and based on a cut-off grade of 1.0 g/t Au. The solids veins\nextend to a radius of up to 50 m from the last selected intercept or are fixed at the mid-distance of an intercept\nthat does not meet the minimum grade criterion. The solids were snapped to drill holes. The solids were\ncreated from the axial planar structural data using 3-g/t indicator interpolants.\nThe geological model for the BC Vein includes one (1) sheared solid representing the mineralized layer\nparallel vein, along with five (5) solids representing mineralized layer parallel splays. The solids were\nmodelled in Leapfrog GEO v.5.0.4. The BC Vein and splays were modelled from geological logs and grade\nintervals. The BC Vein was designed with a minimum thickness of 2 m, controlled by the hanging and\nfootwall of the shear, and was based on a cut-off grade of 1.0 g/t Au. Geological contacts were given\nprecedent over grade. The splays were designed with a minimum thickness of 2 m and were based on a cut-\noff grade of 1.0 g/t Au. All solids were snapped to drill holes.\nA geological structural contact was modelled between the BC Vein and the KL deposits. The surface is a\nmajor lithological contact between the brittle sandstone, which hosts the KL Axial Planar veins, and the more\nductile carbonaceous mudstones and siltstones that host the BC Vein shear and layer parallel veins. This\ncontact was used as a hard boundary to limit the extent of the mineralized geological models.\nIn 2017, InnovExplo created one (1) solid for the Bonanza Ledge deposit. Construction lines were created\non cross-sections spaced 5 to 25 m apart, which were snapped to drill hole intercepts. The solid was inspired\nby a sulphide shell defined in Brousseau et al. (2017) using a threshold of 3% pyrite and clipped to the\nFootwall Fault to the southwest, which was modelled from drill hole logs. The authors reviewed and validated\nthe 2017 model and concluded that the model remains accurate for the 2020 MRE update.\nTwo surfaces were created for each deposit to define the topography and the overburden/bedrock contact.\nThe topography was created using LIDAR data from 2016, except for Bonanza Ledge, which used LIDAR\ndata from 2000 (before the test pit was excavated at the Bonanza Ledge Mine). The overburden-bedrock\ncontact was modelled using logged overburden intervals. A waste solid was also created for Bonanza Ledge\ncorresponding to the block model limits.\nMineral Resource Estimate\nThe author has classified the resource in the Cariboo Technical Report as measured, indicated, and inferred\nmineral resources based on geological and grade continuity, data density, search ellipse criteria, drill hole\ndensity, and interpolation parametres. The author is of the opinion that the reasonable prospect for an\neventual economic extraction requirement is met by having a minimum width for the modelling of the\nmineralized zones and with a cut-off grade that using reasonable input, both for a potential underground\nextraction scenario.\n85\n328031.00001/116753121.9\nThe Cariboo Technical Report is considered to be reliable and based on quality data and geological\nknowledge. The mineral resource estimate follow CIM Definition Standards.\nInnovExplo is of the opinion that the current mineral resource estimate can be categorized as measured,\nindicated, and inferred mineral resources based on data density, search ellipse criteria, drill hole density,\nand interpolation parametres. InnovExplo considers the 2020 MRE to be reliable and based on quality data\nand geological understanding with parametres that follow CIM Definition Standards.\nTable 8 displays the results of the 2020 MRE for the Cariboo Project at the official 2.1 g/t Au cut-off grade\nfor all eight deposits: Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, KL, Lowhee, BC Vein and Bonanza Ledge.\nTable 8 - 2020 Cariboo Project Mineral Resource Estimate at 2.1 g/t Au cut-off\nTonnes Grade Ounces\nCategory Deposit (‘000) (‘000) (‘000)\nMeasured Bonanza Ledge 240 5.10 39\nBonanza Ledge 86 3.88 11\nBC Vein 1192 4.68 179\nKL 393 3.32 42\nLowhee 381 3.72 46\nIndicated\nMosquito 783 5.95 150\nShaft 10889 4.70 1644\nValley 1744 4.49 251\nCow 5734 4.55 838\nTotal Indicated Resources 21,201 4.64 3,161\nBC Vein 472 3.94 60\nKL 1926 2.93 181\nLowhee 1032 3.16 105\nInferred Mosquito 1348 4.79 208\nShaft 7913 4.25 1081\nValley 5683 3.95 722\nCow 3276 3.45 364\nTotal Measured and Indicated Resources 21,442 4.64 3,200\nTotal Inferred Resources 21,650 3.91 2,721\nMRE Notes:\n1. The independent and qualified persons for the mineral resource estimates, as defined by NI 43-\n101, are Christine Beausoleil, P.Geo., and Carl Pelletier, P.Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.). The effective\ndate of the mineral resource estimate is October 5, 2020.\n2. These mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic\nviability.\n3. The mineral resource estimate follows CIM Definition Standards.\n4. A total of 334 vein zones were modelled for the Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley), Island Mountain\n(Shaft and Mosquito), Barkerville Mountain (BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee) deposits and one (1) gold\nzone for Bonanza Ledge. A minimum true thickness of 2.0 m was applied, using the grade of the\nadjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed.\n86\n328031.00001/116753121.9\n5. The estimate is reported for a potential underground scenario at cut-off grade of 2.1 g/t Au. The\ncut-off grades were calculated using a gold price of US$1,350 per ounce.\nInterpretation and Conclusions\nAfter conducting a detailed review of all pertinent information and completing the Cariboo Technical Report\nmandate, InnovExplo concludes the following:\n• The results demonstrate the geological and grade continuities for all eight (8) gold deposits in the\nCow-Island-Barkerville Mountain Corridor.\nIn an underground scenario, the Cariboo Project contains an estimated Measured Resource of\n240,000 tonnes grading at 5.1 g/t Au for a total of 39,000 ounces of gold, and Indicated Resource\nof 21,201,000 tonnes grading at 4.6 g/t Au for a total of 3,161,000 ounces, and an Inferred Resource\nof 21,649,000 tonnes grading 3.9 g/t Au for a total of 2,721,000 ounces.\n• The resource estimates for the Cow, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein & Splays deposits were updated\nusing the 2019 drill results.\n• Initial mineral resource estimates for the KL and Lowhee deposits used the 2019 drill results.\n• No change is reported for the Valley and Bonanza Ledge deposits.\n• Additional diamond drilling on multiple zones would likely increase the inferred resources and\nupgrade some of the inferred resources to indicated resources.\nInnovExplo considers the Cariboo Technical Report to be reliable, thorough, based on quality data,\nreasonable hypotheses, and parametres compliant with NI 43 101 requirements and CIM Definition\nStandards.\nRecommendations\nInnovExplo recommends: continuing the exploration program (see below for details); updating the existing\nPEA for new mining scenarios at lower grades using data from the geotechnical, hydrogeological and\nmetallurgical studies; continuing the permitting process for an underground bulk sample; conducting a\nfeasibility study after obtaining said permits; continuing the community outreach program; and conducting\na characterization study of the mining project environment in tandem with these other projects.\nIt is recommended that the exploration program consist of drilling (infill and exploration), geological\nmapping and grab sampling to test the extensions of known higher-grade vein corridors and to identify\nnew targets.\n87\n328031.00001/116753121.9"

Nature of operations and going concern\nOsisko Development Corp. (“Osisko Development” or the “Company”) is a mineral exploration and development\ncompany focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of precious metals resource properties in North\nAmerica. Osisko Development is focused on exploring and developing its mining assets, including the Cariboo Gold\nProject in British Columbia, the San Antonio Gold Project in Mexico and the Trixie Test Mine in the USA.\nThe Company’s registered and business address is 1100, avenue des Canadiens-de-Montréal, suite 300, Montreal,\nQuébec and is constituted under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The common shares of Osisko Development\ntrade under the symbol ODV on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”) and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).\nAs at March 31, 2024, the former parent Company, Osisko Gold Royalties (“OGR”) held an interest of 39.6% in Osisko\nDevelopment.\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting\nprinciples applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the\nnormal course of business as they come due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate,\nManagement takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve\nmonths from the end of the reporting year. As at March 31, 2024, the Company has a negative working capital of $13.5\nmillion, which included cash and cash equivalent balance of $57.5 million. The Company also has an accumulated\ndeficit of $519.1 million and incurred a net loss of $8.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nThe working capital position as at March 31, 2024 will not be sufficient to meet the Company’s obligations, commitments\nand forecasted expenditures up to the period ending March 31, 2025. Management is aware, in making its assessment,\nof material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon the Company's ability\nto continue as a going concern as described in the preceding paragraph, and accordingly, the appropriateness of the\nuse of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, expenses and financial position\nclassifications that would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These adjustments could\nbe material.\nThe Company’s ability to continue future operations and fund its planned activities is dependent on Management’s\nability to secure additional financing in the future, which may be completed in several ways including, but not limited to,\na combination of selling additional investments from its portfolio, project debt finance, offtake or royalty financing and\nother capital market alternatives. Failure to secure future financings may impact and/or curtail the planned activities for\nthe Company, which may include, but are not limited to, the suspension of certain development activities and the\ndisposal of certain investments to generate liquidity. While Management has been successful in securing financing in\nthe past, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future or that these sources of funding or initiatives\nwill be available to the Company or that they will be available on terms which are acceptable to the Company. If\nManagement is unable to obtain new funding, the Company may be unable to continue its operations, and amounts\nrealized for assets might be less than the amounts reflected in these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements.\n2. Basis of presentation and Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS\nAccounting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and as applicable\nto the preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. Accordingly, certain\ndisclosures included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS have been condensed or\nomitted and these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with\nthe Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The accounting\npolicies, methods of computation and presentation applied in the preparation of these unaudited condensed interim\nconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the application of\n8\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nthe Amendments to IAS 1 as described in Note 3. The comparative figures as at December 31, 2023 were adjusted\naccordingly.\nThe Board of Directors approved these condensed interim consolidated financial statements May 6, 2024.\n3. New accounting standards and amendments\nMaterial accounting standards and amendments\nAmendments – IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of liabilities as current or non-current and\nnon-current liabilities with covenants\nThe Company applied Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1 for the first time\nfrom January 1, 2024. The amendments:\n Clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should only be based on rights that are in\nplace “at the end of the reporting period”;\n Clarify that classification is unaffected by intentions or expectations about whether an entity will exercise its\nright to defer settlement of a liability; and\n Make clear that settlement includes transfers to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or\nservices that result in extinguishment of the liability.\nThe application of the Amendments to IAS 1 resulted in a change in the Company’s accounting policy for classification\nof liabilities that can be settled in the Company’s own shares (e.g. the Warrants liability) from non-current to current\nliabilities. Under the revised accounting policy, when a liability includes a counterparty conversion option that may be\nsettled by the issuance of the Company’s common shares, the conversion option is taken into account in classifying the\nliability as current or non-current except when it is classified as an equity component of a compound instrument. The\nWarrants liability is classified as current as at March 31, 2024 because the conversion option can be exercised by the\nwarrants holders at any time.\nThe Amendments to IAS 1 had a retrospective impact on the comparative consolidated statement of financial position\nas the Company had outstanding Warrants liability as at December 31, 2023. The Warrants liability as at December 31,\n2023 was entirely reclassified from non-current to current liabilities.\nThe Company’s other liabilities were not impacted by the Amendments to IAS 1.\n9\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\n4.

Warrant Liability\nThe warrants issued as part of the 2022 non-brokered private placement include an embedded derivative as they are\nexercisable in U.S. dollars and, therefore, fail the “fixed for fixed” requirements prescribed in IAS 32 Financial\nInstruments: presentation. As a result, they are classified as a liability and measured at fair value. The liability is\nrevalued at its estimated fair value using the Black-Scholes model at the end of each reporting period, and the\nvariation in the fair value is recognized on the consolidated statements of loss under Change in fair value of warrant\nliability. As described in Note 3, the warrant liability is presented as a current liability since January 1, 2024 in\nconnection with the application of the Amendments to IAS 1.\nThe movement of the warrant liability is as follows:\n2024 2023\n$ $\nFair value through profit or loss (warrants)\nBalance – Beginning of period 11,552 16,395.0\nChange in fair value (9,070) (4,535)\nForeign exchange 283 (308)\nBalance – End of period 2,765 11,552\n15\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nIn absence of quoted market prices, the fair value of the warrants exercisable in USD is determined using the Black-\nScholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions and inputs:\n2024 2023\nDividend per share — —\nExpected volatility 61.5 % 78.3 %\nRisk-free interest rate 4.42 % 4.00 %\nExpected life 3.2 years 3.4 years\nExercise price (USD) $ 10.70 $ 10.70\nShare price (USD) $ 2.13 $ 2.91\n14.

The value of\nthe payout is determined by multiplying the number of DSU expected to be vested at the payout date by the closing\nprice of the Company’s shares on the day prior to the grant date. The fair value is recognized over the vesting\nperiod.

Fair value of financial instruments\nThe following table provides information about financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the consolidated\nstatements of financial position and categorized by level according to the significance of the inputs used in making the\nmeasurements.\nLevel 1– Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2– Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly\n(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and\nLevel 3–Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).\nMarch 3 1, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n$ $ $ $\nRecurring measurements\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nWarrants on equity securities\nPublicly traded mining exploration and development companies\nPrecious metals — — 300 300\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive loss\nEquity securities\nPublicly traded mining exploration and development companies\nPrecious metals 5,109 — — 5,109\nOther minerals 10,785 — — 10,785\n15,894 — 300 16,194\n19\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nD ecember 3 1, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n$ $ $ $\nRecurring measurements\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nWarrants on equity securities\nPublicly traded mining exploration and development companies\nPrecious metals — — 4 4\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive loss\nEquity securities\nPublicly traded mining exploration and development companies\nPrecious metals 5,739 — — 5,739\nOther minerals 13,650 — — 13,650\n19,389 — 4 19,393\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 there were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.\nFinancial instruments in Level 1\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices on a recognized\nsecurities exchange at the statement of financial position dates. The quoted market price used for financial assets held\nby the Company is the last transaction price. Instruments included in Level 1 consist primarily of common shares trading\non recognized securities exchanges, such as the TSX or the TSX Venture.\nFinancial instruments in Level 2\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation\ntechniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as\nlittle as possible on the Company’ specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to measure the fair value of an\ninstrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs are not based\non observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\nFinancial instruments in Level 3\nFinancial instruments classified in Level 3 include investments in private companies and warrants held by the Company\nthat are not traded on a recognized securities exchange. At each statement of financial position date, the fair value of\ninvestments held in private companies is evaluated using a discounted cash-flows approach. The main valuation inputs\nused in the cashflows models being significant unobservable inputs, these investments are classified in Level 3. The\nfair value of the investments in warrants is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which includes\nsignificant inputs not based on observable market data. Therefore, investments in warrants are included in Level 3.\nThe following table presents the changes in the Level 3 investments (warrants and convertible loan) for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024 2023\n$ $\nBalance – Beginning of period 4 18\nChange in fair value (i) 296 —\nBalance – End of period 300 18\n20\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\n(i) Recognized in the consolidated statements of loss under other income, net.\nThe fair value of the financial instruments classified as Level 3 depends on the nature of the financial instruments.\nThe fair value of the warrants on equity securities of publicly traded mining exploration and development companies\nand the convertible debentures, classified as Level 3, is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model or\ndiscounted cash flows. The main non-observable input used in the model is the expected volatility. An\nincrease/decrease in the expected volatility used in the models of 10% would lead to an insignificant variation in the fair\nvalue of the warrants as at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFinancial instruments not measured at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial position\nFinancial instruments that are not measured at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position are\nrepresented by cash and cash equivalents, reclamation deposits, trade receivables, interest income receivable,\namounts receivable from associates and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long-term debt.\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, amounts receivable from associates and other\nreceivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and short-term debt approximate their carrying values due to their\nshort-term nature. The carrying value of the reclamation deposits and long-term debt approximates their fair value given\nthat their interest rates are similar to the rates the Company would obtain under similar conditions at the reporting date.\n19.

Nature of operations and going concern\nOsisko Development Corp. (“Osisko Development” or the “Company”) is a mineral exploration and development\ncompany focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of precious metals resource properties in North\nAmerica. Osisko Development is focused on exploring and developing its mining assets, including the Cariboo Gold\nProject in British Columbia, the San Antonio Gold Project in Mexico and the Trixie Test Mine in the USA.\nThe Company’s registered and business address is 1100, avenue des Canadiens-de-Montréal, suite 300, Montreal,\nQuébec and is constituted under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The common shares of Osisko Development\ntrade under the symbol ODV on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”) and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).\nAs at June 30, 2024, the former parent Company, Osisko Gold Royalties (“OGR”) held an interest of 39.0% in Osisko\nDevelopment.\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting\nprinciples applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the\nnormal course of business as they come due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate,\nManagement takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve\nmonths from the end of the reporting period. As at June 30, 2024, the Company has a negative working capital of $29.6\nmillion, which included cash and cash equivalent balance of $33.7 million. The Company also has an accumulated\ndeficit of $548.0 million and incurred a net loss of $36.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe working capital position as at June 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to meet the Company’s obligations, commitments\nand forecasted expenditures up to the period ending June 30, 2025. Management is aware, in making its assessment,\nof material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon the Company's ability\nto continue as a going concern as described in the preceding paragraph, and accordingly, the appropriateness of the\nuse of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, expenses and financial position\nclassifications that would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These adjustments could\nbe material.\nThe Company’s ability to continue future operations and fund its planned activities is dependent on Management’s\nability to secure additional financing in the future, which may be completed in several ways including, but not limited to,\na combination of selling additional investments from its portfolio, project debt finance, offtake or royalty financing and\nother capital market alternatives. Failure to secure future financings may impact and/or curtail the planned activities for\nthe Company, which may include, but are not limited to, the suspension of certain development activities and the\ndisposal of certain investments to generate liquidity. While Management has been successful in securing financing in\nthe past, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future or that these sources of funding or initiatives\nwill be available to the Company or that they will be available on terms which are acceptable to the Company. If\nManagement is unable to obtain new funding, the Company may be unable to continue its operations, and amounts\nrealized for assets might be less than the amounts reflected in these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements.\n2. Basis of presentation and Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS\nAccounting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and as applicable\nto the preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. Accordingly, certain\ndisclosures included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS have been condensed or\nomitted and these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with\nthe Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The accounting\npolicies, methods of computation and presentation applied in the preparation of these unaudited condensed interim\nconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the application of\n8\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nthe Amendments to IAS 1 as described in Note 3. The comparative figures as at December 31, 2023 were adjusted\naccordingly.\nThe Board of Directors approved these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements August 12,\n2024.\n3. New accounting standards and amendments\nMaterial accounting standards and amendments\nAmendments – IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of liabilities as current or non-current and\nnon-current liabilities with covenants\nThe Company applied Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1 for the first time\nfrom January 1, 2024. The amendments:\n− Clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should only be based on rights that are in\nplace “at the end of the reporting period”;\n− Clarify that classification is unaffected by intentions or expectations about whether an entity will exercise its\nright to defer settlement of a liability; and\n− Make clear that settlement includes transfers to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or\nservices that result in extinguishment of the liability.\nThe application of the Amendments to IAS 1 resulted in a change in the Company’s accounting policy for classification\nof liabilities that can be settled in the Company’s own shares (e.g. the Warrants liability) from non-current to current\nliabilities. Under the revised accounting policy, when a liability includes a counterparty conversion option that may be\nsettled by the issuance of the Company’s common shares, the conversion option is taken into account in classifying the\nliability as current or non-current except when it is classified as an equity component of a compound instrument. The\nWarrants liability is classified as current as at June 30, 2024 because the conversion option can be exercised by the\nwarrants holders at any time.\nThe Amendments to IAS 1 had a retrospective impact on the comparative consolidated statement of financial position\nas the Company had outstanding Warrants Liability as at December 31, 2023. The Warrants Liability as at December\n31, 2023 was entirely reclassified from non-current to current liabilities.\nThe Company’s other liabilities were not impacted by the Amendments to IAS 1.\n9\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\n4.

The quoted market price used for financial assets held\nby the Company is the last transaction price. Instruments included in Level 1 consist primarily of common shares trading\non recognized securities exchanges, such as the TSX or the TSX Venture.\n20\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nFinancial instruments in Level 2\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation\ntechniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as\nlittle as possible on the Company’ specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to measure the fair value of an\ninstrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs are not based\non observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\nFinancial instruments in Level 3\nFinancial instruments classified in Level 3 include investments in private companies and warrants held by the Company\nthat are not traded on a recognized securities exchange. At each statement of financial position date, the fair value of\ninvestments held in private companies is evaluated using a discounted cash-flows approach. The main valuation inputs\nused in the cashflows models being significant unobservable inputs, these investments are classified in Level 3. The\nfair value of the investments in warrants is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which includes\nsignificant inputs not based on observable market data. Therefore, investments in warrants are included in Level 3.\nThe following table presents the changes in the Level 3 investments (warrants) for the six months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023:\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nBalance – Beginning of period 4 18\nChange in fair value (i) 99 31\nBalance – End of period 103 49\n(i) Recognized in the consolidated statements of loss under other income, net.\nThe fair value of the financial instruments classified as Level 3 depends on the nature of the financial instruments.\nThe fair value of the warrants on equity securities of publicly traded mining exploration and development companies,\nclassified as Level 3, is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The main non-observable input used\nin the model is the expected volatility. An increase/decrease in the expected volatility used in the models of 10% would\nlead to an insignificant variation in the fair value of the warrants as at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFinancial instruments not measured at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial position\nFinancial instruments that are not measured at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position are\nrepresented by cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, reclamation deposits, trade receivables, interest income\nreceivable, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long-term debt. The fair values of cash and\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and\nshort-term debt approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the reclamation\ndeposits and long-term debt approximates their fair value given that their interest rates are similar to the rates the\nCompany would obtain under similar conditions at the reporting date.\n21\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\n19.

Nature of operations and going concern\nOsisko Development Corp. (“Osisko Development” or the “Company”) is a mineral exploration and development\ncompany focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of precious metals resource properties in continental\nNorth America. Osisko Development is focused on exploring and developing its mining assets, including the Cariboo\nGold Project in British Columbia, the San Antonio Gold Project in Mexico and the Trixie Test Mine in the USA.\nThe Company’s registered and business address is 1100, avenue des Canadiens-de-Montréal, suite 300, Montreal,\nQuébec and is constituted under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The common shares of Osisko Development\ntrade under the symbol ODV on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”) and on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).\nAs at September 30, 2024, the former parent Company, Osisko Gold Royalties (“OGR”) held an interest of 39.0% in\nOsisko Development.\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting\nprinciples applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the\nnormal course of business as they come due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate,\nmanagement takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve\nmonths from the end of the reporting period. As at September 30, 2024, the Company has a negative working capital\nof $64.7 million, which included cash and cash equivalent balance of $40.8 million. The Company also has an\naccumulated deficit of $581.8 million and incurred a net loss of $70.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024.\nThe working capital position as at September 30, 2024 and the gross proceeds from private placements completed\nsubsequently to quarter-end (Note 21) will not be sufficient to meet the Company’s obligations, commitments and\nforecasted expenditures up to the period ending September 30, 2025. Management is aware, in making its assessment,\nof material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon the Company's ability\nto continue as a going concern as described in the preceding paragraph, and accordingly, the appropriateness of the\nuse of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, expenses and financial position\nclassifications that would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These adjustments could\nbe material.\nThe Company’s ability to continue future operations and fund its planned activities is dependent on management’s\nability to secure additional financing in the future, which may be completed in several ways including, but not limited to,\na combination of selling additional investments from its portfolio, project debt finance, offtake or royalty financing and\nother capital market alternatives. Failure to secure future financings may impact and/or curtail the planned activities for\nthe Company, which may include, but are not limited to, the suspension of certain development activities and the\ndisposal of certain investments to generate liquidity. While management has been successful in securing financing in\nthe past and as disclosed in Note 21, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future or that these\nsources of funding or initiatives will be available to the Company or that they will be available on terms which are\nacceptable to the Company. If Management is unable to obtain new funding, the Company may be unable to continue\nits operations, and amounts realized for assets might be less than the amounts reflected in these unaudited condensed\ninterim consolidated financial statements.\n2. Basis of presentation and Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS\nAccounting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and as applicable\nto the preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. Accordingly, certain\ndisclosures included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS have been condensed or\nomitted and these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with\nthe Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The accounting\n8\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\npolicies, methods of computation and presentation applied in the preparation of these unaudited condensed interim\nconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the application of\nthe Amendments to IAS 1 as described in Note 3. The comparative figures as at December 31, 2023 were adjusted\naccordingly.\nThe Board of Directors approved these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements November 12,\n2024.\n3. New accounting standards and amendments\nMaterial accounting standards and amendments adopted in 2024\nAmendments – IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of liabilities as current or non-current and\nnon-current liabilities with covenants\nThe Company applied Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1 for the first time\nfrom January 1, 2024. The amendments:\n− Clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should only be based on rights that are in\nplace “at the end of the reporting period”;\n− Clarify that classification is unaffected by intentions or expectations about whether an entity will exercise its\nright to defer settlement of a liability; and\n− Make clear that settlement includes transfers to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or\nservices that result in extinguishment of the liability.\nThe application of the Amendments to IAS 1 resulted in a change in the Company’s accounting policy for classification\nof liabilities that can be settled in the Company’s own shares (e.g. the Warrants Liability) from non-current to current\nliabilities. Under the revised accounting policy, when a liability includes a counterparty conversion option that may be\nsettled by the issuance of the Company’s common shares, the conversion option is taken into account in classifying the\nliability as current or non-current except when it is classified as an equity component of a compound instrument. The\nWarrants Liability is classified as current as at September 30, 2024 because the conversion option can be exercised by\nthe warrants holders at any time.\nThe Amendments to IAS 1 had a retrospective impact on the comparative consolidated statement of financial position\nas the Company had outstanding Warrants Liability as at December 31, 2023. The Warrants Liability as at December\n31, 2023 was entirely reclassified from non-current to current liabilities.\nThe Company’s other liabilities were not impacted by the Amendments to IAS 1.\nNew accounting standards issued but not yet effective\nAmendments – IFRS 9, Financial Instruments and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosure\nThe IASB has issued classification and measurement and disclosure amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 which are\neffective for years beginning on or after January 1, 2026 with earlier application permitted. The amendments clarify the\ndate of recognition and derecognition of some financial assets and liabilities and introduce a new exception for some\nfinancial liabilities settled through an electronic payment system. Other changes include a clarification of the\nrequirements when assessing whether a financial asset meets the solely payments of principal and interest criteria and\n9\nOsisko Development Corp.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except number of shares and per share amounts)\nnew disclosures for certain instruments with contractual terms that can change cash flows (including instruments where\ncash flow changes are linked to environmental, social or governance targets).\nNew standard – IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\nIFRS 18 is a new standard that will provide new presentation and disclosure requirements and which will replace IAS\n1, Presentation of Financial Statements. IFRS 18 introduces changes to the structure of the statement of income (loss);\nprovides required disclosures in financial statements for certain profit or loss performance measures that are reported\noutside an entity’s financial statements; and provides enhanced principles on aggregation and disaggregation in\nfinancial statements. Many other existing principles in IAS 1 have been maintained. IFRS 18 is effective for years\nbeginning on or after January 1, 2027, with earlier application permitted.\nThe Company is currently assessing the impact of the new and amended standards issued but not yet effective.\n4.

These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as\nlittle as possible on the Company’ specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to measure the fair value of an\ninstrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs are not based\non observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\nFinancial instruments in Level 3\nFinancial instruments classified in Level 3 include investments in private companies and warrants held by the Company\nthat are not traded on a recognized securities exchange. At each statement of financial position date, the fair value of\ninvestments held in private companies is evaluated using a discounted cash-flows approach. The main valuation inputs\nused in the cashflows models being significant unobservable inputs, these investments are classified in Level 3. The\nfair value of the investments in warrants is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which includes\nsignificant inputs not based on observable market data. Therefore, investments in warrants are included in Level 3.\nThe following table presents the changes in the Level 3 investments (warrants) for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nBalance – Beginning of period 4 18\nChange in fair value (i) 239 6\nBalance – End of period 243 24\n(i) Recognized in the consolidated statements of loss under other income, net.\nThe fair value of the financial instruments classified as Level 3 depends on the nature of the financial instruments.\nThe fair value of the warrants on equity securities of publicly traded mining exploration and development companies,\nclassified as Level 3, is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The main non-observable input used\nin the model is the expected volatility. An increase/decrease in the expected volatility used in the models of 10% would\nlead to an insignificant variation in the fair value of the warrants as at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFinancial instruments not measured at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial position\nFinancial instruments that are not measured at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial position are\nrepresented by cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, reclamation deposits, trade receivables, interest income\nreceivable, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long-term debt. The fair values of cash and\ncash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and\nshort-term debt approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nThis MD&A contains certain non-IFRS (as defined herein) measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" (or \"AISC\") and \"cash\ncost\". All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative,\nexploration, other expenses and sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS\nmeasure reported by the Company on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general\nand administration costs and royalties but exclude depreciation, reclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs\nfor the life of the mine. Management believes that such measures provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the\nperformance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and,\ntherefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide\nadditional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in\naccordance with IFRS, such as Cost of sales.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the statements of historical fact contained herein, the information presented in this MD&A constitutes \"forward-\nlooking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian Securities Laws concerning the business, operations, plans\nand financial performance and condition of the Company (collectively, the \"Forward-Looking Information\").

Such factors include, among others: risks\nrelating to capital markets and the availability of future financing on the term acceptable to the Company (or at all); the ability\nof the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due; actual operating cash flows, operating costs, free\ncash flows, mineral resources and reserves and other costs differing materially from those anticipated; changes in project\nparameters; project infrastructure requirements and anticipated processing methods, exploration expenditures differing\nmaterially from those anticipated; actual results of current exploration activities; variations in mineral resources, mineral\nreserves, mineral production, grades or recovery rates or optimization efforts and sales; failure to obtain, or delays in\nobtaining, governmental approvals or financing or in the completion of development or construction activities; uninsured\nrisks, including, but not limited to, pollution, cave-ins or hazards for which insurance cannot be obtained; regulatory changes,\ndefects in title; availability or integration of personnel, materials and equipment; risks relating to foreign operations; inability\nto recruit or retain management and key personnel; performance of facilities, equipment and processes relative to\nspecifications and expectations; unanticipated environmental impacts on operations; market prices; production, construction\nand technological risks or capital requirements and operating risks associated with the operations or an expansion of the\noperations, dilution due to future equity financings, fluctuations in gold, silver and other metal prices and currency exchange\nrates; uncertainty relating to future production and cash resources; inability to successfully complete new development\nprojects, planned expansions or other projects within the timelines anticipated; inability to achieve the business and project\nmilestones as anticipated; adverse changes to market, political and general economic conditions or laws, rules and\nregulations applicable to the Company; outbreak of diseases and public health crises; the possibility of project cost overruns\nor unanticipated costs and expenses; accidents, labour disputes, community and stakeholder protests and other risks of\nthe mining industry; failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; risk of an undiscovered defect in title\nor other adverse claim; factors discussed under the heading \"Risk and Uncertainties\" in this MD&A and \"Risk Factors\" in\nthe Company’s annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023; and other risks, including those risks set\nout in the continuous disclosure documents of the Company, which are available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on\nEDGAR (www.sec.gov) under the issuer profiles of the Company.\n3\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nIn addition, Forward-Looking Information herein is based on certain assumptions and involves risks related to the business\nof the Company. Forward-Looking Information contained herein is based on certain assumptions, including, but are not\nlimited to, interest and exchange rates; the price of gold, silver and other metals; competitive conditions in the mining\nindustry; title to mineral properties; financing and funding requirements; general economic, political and market conditions;\nand changes in laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company.\nAlthough the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause plans, actions, events or results to differ\nmaterially from those described in Forward-Looking Information in this MD&A, there may be other factors that cause plans,\nactions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended.

However,\nalthough generally indicative of relative market positions, market shares and performance characteristics, this data is\ninherently imprecise. While the Company is not aware of any misstatement regarding any industry data presented herein,\nthe mining industry involves risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various factors.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Forward-Looking Information. The Company does not undertake any\nobligation to update any of the Forward-Looking Information in this MD&A, except as required by law.\nCautionary Note to U.S. Investors Regarding the Use of Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Estimates\nThe Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian Securities Laws, and as a result reports\ninformation regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources in\naccordance with Canadian reporting requirements, which are governed by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of\nDisclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). As such, the information contained in this MD&A concerning mineral\nproperties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information\nmade public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\n1. OUR BUSINESS\nOsisko Development is a Canadian-based exploration and development company focused on past-producing properties\nlocated in mining friendly jurisdictions with district scale potential. The Company’s objective is to become a North American\nintermediate producer of precious metals, through curating and advancing a portfolio of development projects and\ninvestments with potential for value creation. The principal mining assets wholly owned through subsidiaries of the Company\nas of March 31, 2024, are as follows:\n Cariboo Gold Project (Permitting – British Columbia, Canada) (the \"Cariboo Gold Project\"), owned and operated\nby Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd. (\"Barkerville\").\n Tintic Project (including, the Trixie test mine located within the Company’s wider Tintic Project) (Test mining and\nexploration – Utah, United States) (the \"Tintic Project\"), owned and operated by Tintic Consolidated Metals LLC\n(\"Tintic\").\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Project, which includes\nexploring the potential for a financial or strategic partner in the asset or for a full or partial sale of the asset. The Company\nhas engaged a financial advisor in connection with the strategic review.\n4\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nAs an exploration and development stage corporation, the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows to advance the\nevaluation and development of its various projects and properties and has historically relied on equity and debt funding to\nmaintain financial liquidity. Continued adequate financial liquidity is dependent on management's ability to secure additional\nfinancings in the future; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financings\nin the future, or at terms favourable to the Company (refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\").\nThe accompanied unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of\naccounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities\nin the normal course of business as they come due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate,\nManagement takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve months\nfrom the end of the reporting period. The working capital position as at March 31, 2024, will not be sufficient to meet the\nCompany’s obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures up to the period ending March 31, 2025. Management\nis aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial\ndoubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and accordingly, the appropriateness of the use of\naccounting principles applicable to a going concern.\n2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nOperations and financial\nThree months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\n In Q1 2024, the Company generated revenues of $1.8 million and incurred an operating loss of $20.5 million\ncompared to $3.5 million and $22.3 million respectively, in Q1 2023. In Q1 2024, the decrease in revenues\ncompared to Q1 2023 is mainly attributable to the decrease of revenue from Bonanza Ledge II and the reduction of\nsales from the Tintic Project and the San Antonio Project, both projects in care and maintenance during Q1 2024.\nThe lower operating loss in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2022 is primarily due to the decrease in the level of activities.\n In Q1 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $8.0 million compared to a net loss of $23.3 million in Q1 2023.\nThe decrease in net loss is primarily due to the reasons noted above offset by a higher fair value gain adjustment\nof the warrant liability in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023.\n The net cash flows used in operating activities in Q1 2024 amounted to $9.1 million compared to $12.8 million in\nQ1 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the general operating activities at the Tintic Project and\nthe San Antonio Project, including the impact on each project’s respective working capital.\n Additions to mining interests, property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation expenses for Q1 2024\namounted to $10.1 million compared to $23.7 million in Q1 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in\nmining development activities including the decrease in exploration spending at the Cariboo Gold Project.\n Net cash inflows from financing activities amounted to $29.1 million in Q1 2024 compared to net cash inflows of\n$52.1 million in Q1 2023. In Q1 2023, the Company completed a bought deal financing of $51.8 million.

See\n\"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\".\n7\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\n6.1. Cariboo Gold Project – British Columbia, Canada\nThe Cariboo Gold Project is an advanced stage gold exploration project 100%-owned by the Company located in the historic\nWells-Barkerville mining camp, in the District of Wells, central British Columbia, Canada, that extends for approximately 77\nkilometres from northwest to southeast. The Company’s total land package consists of 415 mineral titles and covers an\narea of approximately 155,000 hectares. On November 21, 2019, OGR acquired the Cariboo Gold Project through the\nacquisition of Barkerville. The project was part of the OGR contributed assets that created the Company on November 25,\n2020.\nTechnical reports and mineral resource estimate\nThe Company completed a Feasibility Study (\"FS\") for the Cariboo Gold Project with an effective date of January 12, 2023.\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by the\ntechnical report filed in respect of the FS on the Cariboo Gold Project titled \"Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project,\nDistrict of Well, British Columbia, Canada\", dated January 10, 2023 (as amended January 12, 2023) with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022 (the \"Cariboo FS\"), which was prepared for the Company by Colin Hardie, P.

The Mineral Resource Estimate conforms to the 2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves\nand follows the 2019 CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines.\n9\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\n3. A total of 481 vein zones were modelled for the Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley), Island Mountain (Shaft and Mosquito),\nBarkerville Mountain (BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee) deposits and one gold zone for Bonanza Ledge. A minimum true\nthickness of 2.0 m was applied, using the Au gold grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when\nnot assayed.\n4. The estimate is reported for a potential underground scenario at a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au, except for Bonanza Ledge\nat a cut- off grade of 3.5 g/t Au. The cut-off grade for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee deposits\nwas calculated using a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $54.32/t;\na processing and transport cost of $22.29/t;a G&A plus Environmental cost of $15.31/t; and a sustaining CAPEX cost of\n$31.19/t. The cut-off grade for the Bonanza Ledge deposit was calculated using a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD\nexchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $79.13/t; a processing and transport cost of $65.00/t; and a G&A plus\nEnvironmental cost of $51.65/t. The cut-off grades should be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing market conditions\n(metal prices, exchange rate, mining cost, etc.).\n5. Bulk density varies from 2.69 g/ cm3 to 3.20 g/ cm3.\n6. A four-step capping procedure was applied to composited data. Restricted search ellipsoids ranged from 7 to 50 g/t Au\nat four different distances ranging from 25 m to 250 m. High-grades at Bonanza Ledge were capped at 70 g/t Au on 2.0\nm composited data.\n7. The gold Mineral Resources for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee vein zones were estimated\nusing Datamine StudioTM RM 1.9 software using hard boundaries on composited assays. The silver Mineral Resources\nand the dilution halo gold mineralization were estimated using Datamine StudioTM RM Pro 1.11. The OK method was\nused. Mineral Resources for Bonanza Ledge were estimated using GEOVIA GEMSTM 6.7 software using hard\nboundaries on composited assays. The OK method was used to interpolate a block model.\n8. Results are presented in situ. Calculations used metric units (meters, tonnes, g/t). Any discrepancies in the totals are\ndue to rounding effects.\nMineral Reserves Estimate\nProbable Mineral Reserves of 16.7 Mt grading 3.78 g/t Au for 2.03 Moz of contained gold in underground deposits, as\ndefined below, have an effective date of December 6, 2022 and form the basis of the Cariboo FS. Only Mineral Resources\nthat were classified as Measured and Indicated were given economic attributes in the mine design and when demonstrating\neconomic viability were classified as Mineral Reserves, incorporating an external mining dilution factor of 8% into the Mineral\nReserves estimate.\nTable 6: Cariboo Mineral Reserves Statement – December 6, 2022\nTonnes Gold Grade Contained Gold Silver Grade Contained\nClassification / Deposit (000's) (g/t) (000's oz) (g/t) Silver (oz)\nProven — — — — —\nProbable\nCow 4,127 3.41 453 0.08 11,018\nValley 3,445 3.70 410 0.14 15,059\nShaft 7,962 3.87 990 0.02 4,473\nMosquito 603 4.93 95 0.03 619\nLowhee 567 4.56 83 0.21 3,786\nTotal Proven and Probable Reserves 16,703 3.78 2,031 0.07 34,955\nNotes:\n1. Totals may not add up due to rounding.\n2. Mineral Reserves have been estimated in accordance with CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral\nReserves (2014), which are incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.\n3. Mineral Reserves used the following assumptions: US$1,700/oz gold price, USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27, and\nvariable cut- off value from 1.70 g/t to 4.00 g/t Au\n10\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\n4. Mineral Reserves include both internal and external dilution along with mining recovery. The external dilution is\nestimated to be 8%. The average mining recovery factor was set at 93.6% to account for ore left in each block in the\nmargins of the deposit.\nThe mineral resource estimate is built upon over 650,000 meters of core from the 2015 to 2021 drill campaigns, and\nhistorically verified drill data using a total of 3,550 drill holes. A strong understanding of the controls of mineralization enabled\nOsisko Development's technical team to construct a mineral resource estimate constrained by lithology, alteration, structure\nand mineralization.\nOn December 31, 2022, the Cariboo gold project was written down to its net estimated recoverable amount of $435.7 million\nwhich was determined by the value-in-use using a discounted cash-flow approach and reflected as an impairment of Mining\nInterests. The main valuation inputs used were the cash flows expected to be generated by the production and sale of gold\nfrom the Cariboo gold project over the estimated life of the mine, based on the expected long-term gold price per ounce\ncosts inflation forecast and the discount rate of 12.6% applied to the cash flow projections.\nPermitting and EA Process\nOsisko Development started the EA Process in the spring of 2019 for the Cariboo Gold Project.\nOn October 27, 2021, the Province of British Columbia, Lhtako Dené First Nation and the Company announced the approval\nof amendments to Mines Act Permits M-238 and M-198 allowing for the expansion of the existing Bonanza Ledge II\nunderground mine. At the time, these amendments supported the employment of additional workers at the mine. The\nexpansion of the Bonanza Ledge II Project allowed for continuity of certain mining activities while the Cariboo Gold Project\nenvironmental assessment was underway. In July 2021, the province of British Columbia authorized a permit to extract a\nbulk sample of 10,000 tonnes of mineralized material, the development of a portal and 2,200 m of drift to access the mineral\ndeposit.\nOn October 10, 2023, the Company announced that it received an Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") Certificate for the\nCompany’s 100%-owned Cariboo Gold Project. The EA Certificate was granted by the Environmental Assessment Office\nof the Province of British Columbia (\"EAO\") and is supported by approval decisions from The Honourable George Heyman,\nMinister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy and The Honourable Josie Osbourne, Minister of Energy, Mines and\nLow Carbon Innovation. Receipt of the EA Certificate successfully concludes the EA process for the Cariboo Gold Project\nlaunched in October 2019, and completed in consultation with and support of the First Nations partners.\nOn May 31, 2023, the Company submitted its Joint Permit Application (\"JPA\") and passed the screening phase of the permit\nin September 2023 after submitting the final, revised application. Through 4 rounds of review from the Mine Review\nCommittee, the Company responded to, addressed, and closed over 1,800 comments from various stakeholders. The JPA\nreview process is nearing completion, and the Mine Review Committee has begun drafting the Mines Act and Environmental\nManagement Act permits and subsequent reports. With the signed Process Charter, and agreed upon schedule with the\nMajor Mines Office, the Company anticipates completing its permit application referral at the end of Q2 2024 and,\nsubsequently, receiving final permits in Q3 2024.\n11\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nCariboo Gold Project – Permitting Timeline Summary\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Cariboo Gold Project is in advanced stages of permitting and the history of the process is\nsummarized in the following highlights:\n Signing Ceremony on October 23, 2022 with Lhtako Dené First Nation's Elders and Members in Wells and Quesnel\nwas an important event for the life of project agreement between Lhtako Dene First Nation and Osisko Development\nhighlighting the importance of our partnership and mutual support and benefits.\n The Revised Application for the EA Process was submitted to the EAO of British Columbia on October 14, 2022 for\nthe Cariboo Gold Project.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\n2024 Objectives for the Cariboo Gold Project\n Continue permitting activities of the Cariboo Gold Project at a throughput rate of 4,900 tonnes per day with the\ninclusion of the Lowhee Zone.\n Complete detailed engineering on reclamation work, water treatment and waste management for the start-up of the\nCariboo Gold Project.\n Continue stakeholder engagement and finalize agreement with Xatśūll First Nation and District of Wells.\n Commence detailed engineering of the transmission line for connection to the BC Hydro grid.\n Complete the bulk sample in order to test ore sorting and reach ore body and perform mining tests.\n6.2. Bonanza Ledge II Project – British Columbia, Canada\nThe Bonanza Ledge II project is a small scale and short life project that was put into care and maintenance in early June\n2022. The project allows the Company to facilitate (i) opportunities for managing historical reclamation obligations inherited\nby the Company, (ii) hands on training and commissioning of the Company’s mining and processing complex for the Cariboo\nGold Project and (iii) the maintenance of the economic and social benefits for the First Nations partners and communities.\nWhile working through the environmental assessment review, permitting process and the NI 43-101 technical report for its\nCariboo Gold Project, the Company produced approximately 11,424 gold ounces at its Bonanza Ledge II project.\nThe Company started mining operations at its Bonanza Ledge II project in the first quarter of 2021 as it was granted in Q1\n2021, a notice of departure from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation of British Columbia. The\nCompany announced on October 27, 2021 receipt of the final amendments for the Bonanza Ledge II mine and QR mill\npermits. The underground portal was completed in Q4 2021.\nPlease see the caution section \"Risk Factors: Operations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\".\n2024 Objectives\n Improve Water Treatment Plant (\"WTP\") at Bonanza Ledge II to treat nitrate species and QR Mill to remove and\nmanage WTP retentate.\n6.3. Tintic Project – Utah, U.S.A.\nThe Tintic Project is located in western Utah County, approximately 64 km south of Provo, Utah and 95 km south of Salt\nLake City. The property on which the Trixie test mine or Trixie deposit is located encompasses most of the East Tintic\nDistrict, surrounding and immediately east of the incorporated town of Eureka. The area of the Tintic Project owned or\ncontrolled by Osisko Development comprises 1,105 claims totaling 5,746 ha (14,200 acres) of patented mining claims and\na further 107 mining claims of approximately 1,214 ha (3,000 acres), which are overwhelmingly leased patented mining\nclaims. Osisko Development owns a small and varying percentage, interest or royalty in a number of other claims outside\nthe main claim package.\nScientific and technical information relating to the Tintic Project and the updated mineral resource estimate for the Trixie\ndeposit (the \"2024 Trixie MRE\"), including information provided in the table \"2024 Trixie MRE (all zones)\" and the\nassumptions, qualifications and limitations thereof, is supported by the technical report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report,\nMineral Resource Estimate for the Trixie Deposit, Tintic Project, Utah, United States of America\" and dated April 25, 2024\n(with an effective date of March 14, 2024), prepared for the Company by independent representatives of Micon International\nLimited, being William Lewis, P. Geo, and Alan J. San Martin, MAusIMM(CP). Reference should be made to the full text of\n13\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nthe 2024 Trixie MRE technical report, which was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and is available electronically on\nthe Company’s website, SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under the Company’s issuer profile.\nAcquisition of Tintic\nOn May 27, 2022, Osisko Development acquired 100% of Tintic through the purchase of: (i) IG Tintic's direct 75% ownership\nin Tintic; and (ii) all issued and outstanding stock of Chief Consolidated Mining Company (\"Chief\"). Immediately following\nthe closing of the transaction, Chief completed a merger with a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (the \"Merger\"),\nsuch that, following completion of the Merger, Chief is now owned by the Company. The total consideration to the vendors\nin the aggregate amount of approximately US$156.6 million ($199.5 million), comprised of: (i) cash payments of\napproximately US$58.7 million ($74.7 million), (ii) the issuance to the sellers of convertible instruments amounting to $10.8\nmillion (iii) the issuance of 12,049,449 common shares of the Company and, (iv) Deferred consideration and contingent\npayments fair valued at $15.1 million.\nThe deferred payments consist of an amount of US$12.5 million payable in equal instalments annually over five years in\ncash or shares at the Company’s election; (ii) two 1% NSR royalty grants, each with a 50% buyback right in favour of the\nCompany for US$7.5 million which is exercisable within 5 years; (iii) a right to receive the financial equivalent of 10% of the\nnet smelter returns from stockpiled mineralized material extracted from the Tintic Project since January 1, 2018 and sitting\non surface; and (iv) US$10 million contingent upon commencement of production at the Burgin Mine.\nA number of Tintic shareholders had entered into 12-month lock-up agreements which expired on May 27, 2023.\nWith the completion of the transaction, the Company acquired 100% ownership of the producing Trixie test mine, as well\nas mineral claims covering more than 17,000 acres in Central Utah's historic Tintic Mining District. Tintic's ongoing\nexploration work has demonstrated potential for expansion and further discovery both at the Trixie test mine and the broader\nland package. It is hoped that the acquisition of Tintic will, as a result of exploration efforts, serve to accelerate the\nCompany’s path towards becoming a mid-tier gold producer and add further opportunity to explore and develop another\nproject in its portfolio.\nExploration Program\nThe Tintic Project consists of 23 past producing precious and base metal mines located in the East Tintic Mining District,\nUtah, 95 km southwest of Salt Lake City. The Tintic Project is comprised of more than 17,000 acres (6,880 ha), including\n14,200 acres (5,746 ha) of patented mining claims.\nIn 2022, the Company completed 28 surface reverse circulation (\"RC\") drill holes near Trixie totaling approximately 8,442\nm and 62 underground diamond drill (\"DD\") holes in the 625 level at Trixie totaling approximately 3,232 m using two surface\nRC rigs and two underground diamond drill rigs. Continuous underground face samples were collected along all\ndevelopment at Trixie, and together with drill results, formed the basis of an initial mineral resource estimate at Trixie\ncompleted in January 2023.\nIn 2023, the Company completed 73 underground DD holes at Trixie totaling approximately 6,028 m (19,776 ft). All assays\nfrom 2023 have now been finalized. For additional information please refer to the Company’s news release dated February\n22, 2024. One surface drill rig is actively testing for copper-gold porphyry mineralization in the Big Hill target area.\nIn 2023, the Company completed a total of 6,028 m (19,776 ft) of underground drilling in 73 diamond drill holes at Trixie.\nAssays were finalized up to hole TRXU-DD-23-069 and were included in the 2024 Trixie MRE.\nThe 2024 Trixie MRE incorporated an additional 1,674 underground chip samples over 1,678 m (5,507 ft) of underground\ndevelopment, and 7,385 m of drilling (24,229 ft) in 122 holes completed by the Company since the release of the Initial\nTrixie MRE, with an effective date of January 10, 2023.\n14\nOsisko Development Corp.

Effective date of the 2024 Trixie MRE is March 14, 2024.\n2. Each of Mr. William Lewis, P.Geo., of Micon International Limited and Alan J. San Martin, MAusIMM(CP), of Micon\nInternational Limited (i) has reviewed and validated the 2024 Trixie MRE, (ii) is considered to be independent of the\nCompany for purposes of Section 1.5 of NI 43-101, and (iii) is a \"qualified person\" within the meaning of NI 43-101.\n3. The mineral resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining (\"CIM\"), Metallurgy and Petroleum's \"CIM\nDefinition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\" adopted by the CIM council.\n4. Mineral resources are reported when they are within potentially mineable shapes derived from a stope optimizer\nalgorithm, assuming an underground longhole stoping mining method with stopes of 6.1 m x 6.1 m x minimum 1.5 m\ndimensions.\n5. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n6. Geologic modelling was completed by Osisko Development modeling geologist Jody Laing, P.Geo, using Leapfrog Geo\nsoftware. The 2024 Trixie MRE was completed by Osisko Development chief resource geologist, Daniel Downton, P.Geo\nusing Datamine Studio RM 2.0 software. William Lewis and Alan J. San Martin of Micon International Limited\nindependently reviewed and validated the mineral resource model.\n7. The estimate is reported for an underground mining scenario and with USD assumptions. The cut-off grade of 4.32 g/t\nAu was calculated using a gold price of US$1,750/oz, a CAD: USD exchange rate of 1.3; total mining, processing and\nG&A costs of US$168.04/imperial ton; a refining cost of US$2.65/ounce; a combined royalty of 4.50%; and an average\nmetallurgical gold recovery of 80%.\n8. The stope optimizer algorithm evaluated the resources based on a gold equivalent grade which incorporates the silver\ngrade estimate and assumes a silver price of US$23/oz and metallurgical silver recovery of 45%.\n9. Average bulk density values in the mineralized domains were assigned to the T2 (2.955 T/m3), T3 (2.638 T/m3), T4\n(2.618 T/m3), Wild Cat, and 40 Fault (2.621 T/m3), and 75-85 (2.617 T/m3) domains.\n10. Inverse Distance Squared interpolation method was used with a parent block size of 1.2 m x 2.4 m x 2.4 m.\n11. The 2024 Trixie MRE results are presented in-situ. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes, g/t). The number of\ntonnes is rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.\n12. Neither the Company nor Micon International Limited QPs are aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-\nrelated, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the mineral resource\nestimate other than disclosed in the 2024 Trixie MRE.\nDevelopments in 2024 Objectives\nIn Q1 2024, the Company continued surface exploration drilling for porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum at the Big Hill target\nwith one diamond drill rig. A total of 1,663 meters were drilled in Q1 2024 at Big Hill of the initial proposed 3,000 m. At Trixie,\n150 m were drilled in January to complete the testing of the first hole testing for a porphyry target below Trixie. The drilling\nof porphyry targets was completed in early May 2024.\nData compilation from historic mines in the area is ongoing and anticipated to generate additional drill targets on the greater\nTintic Project property.\n15\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nThe development of an underground ramp, which commenced in July 2022, was completed to the 625 level in Q3 2023 with\nthe breakthrough occurring at the end of September. The Company anticipates that the decline ramp will improve\nunderground access for exploration and may potentially support an increase in productivity and mining rates in the future.\nThe ability to achieve any increase in production and the capital required to increase production are the subject of pending\ntechnical work. There can be no assurance that technical work will provide justification for further development, support the\nability to increase production or demonstrate the ability to increase production through a low-capital expenditure expansion\nof the existing facilities. The ability to recommence and expand operations is subject to risks which include the possible\nneed for additional or amended permits, licenses and approvals, risks related to mining operations, the need for additional\ncapital and/or operating expenditures, commodity prices justifying such work, potential scarcity of employees, environmental\nrisks and approvals and the limited knowledge of the mineralized material available on site.\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching\nat the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves,\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any\nparticular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects\nhave a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December\n2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023 and, suspended again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining\nat Trixie re-commences, there is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated\nproduction costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s\nability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs may have\na material adverse impact on the Company’s cash flow and potential profitability. The Company cautions that historically,\nsuch projects have a much higher economic or technical risks. In continuing current operations at Trixie, the Company has\nnot based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability.\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company announced the 2024 Trixie MRE. Compared to the previous 2023 Trixie MRE, contained\ngold ounces in measured and indicated resources decreased by 29% and inferred resources decreased by 79% primarily\ndue to lower estimated grades that incorporated an updated geologic model interpretation and conversion of inferred\nresources. Drill results and underground mapping from the 2023 exploration program improved the knowledge of the extent\nand distribution of mineralization, resulting in modeling improvements to both mineralization and the historical mine shape\nmodel. A technical report in respect of the 2024 Trixie MRE titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate\nfor the Trixie Deposit, Tintic Project, Utah, United States of America\" and dated April 25, 2024 (with an effective date of\nMarch 14, 2024) was subsequently filed on SEDAR+ and EDGAR under the Company’s issuer profile on April 26, 2024.\nThe test mining operations at Trixie were suspended in December 2023 and are expected to remain in care and\nmaintenance for the foreseeable future. As such, on December 31, 2023, an impairment charge of $160.5 million on the\nTrixie test mine was recorded and the net assets of the Trixie test mine were written down to their net estimated recoverable\namount (including mining interest and property, plant and equipment). Management is currently reviewing its options for\nnext steps at the Tintic Project.\nPlease see the caution section \"Risk Factors: Operations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\".\n6.4. San Antonio Gold Project – Sonora State, Mexico\nIn addition to the Cariboo Gold Project and Tintic Project, the Company also owns the San Antonio Gold Project. The San\nAntonio Gold Project is not considered a material property of the Company as of March 31, 2024 and the date of this MD&A,\nand has been under care and maintenance since Q3 2023. No drilling has occurred on the San Antonio Project since 2021\nand there has not been any ongoing exploration program in respect of the San Antonio Gold Project since then.\nThe San Antonio Gold Project is a past-producing oxide copper mine. In 2020, following the acquisition of this project, the\nCompany concentrated its efforts in obtaining the required permits and amendments to the permits to perform its activities.\n16\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nThe Company has filed preventive reports for the processing of the gold stockpile on site and for a drilling program for the\nSapuchi, Golfo de Oro and California zones.\nThe Company also initiated the following activities:\n Commencement of the Environmental Impact Manifest (or Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental (\"MIA\"));\n An environmental baseline study (completed);\n Awarding the Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Management contract for the process of the stockpile.\nOn April 29, 2023, Mexico's Senate approved a wide-ranging reform of laws governing the mining industry, including a\nrequirement that companies pay a percentage of profits to various stakeholders. The new mining law reduces the maximum\nlength of concessions from 50 to 30 years and may allow authorities to cancel concessions if no work is done on them within\ntwo years. The Company is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to assess the potential impacts on its Mexican\nassets.\nSince Osisko Development's acquisition of the San Antonio Project in November 2020, the Company has successfully\nachieved the following operational milestones:\n The construction of a leach pad and carbon in column plant at the end of 2021 to process stockpiled mineralized\nmaterial.\n 1.1 million tonne stockpile with an average grade of 0.58 g/t Au was placed on the heap leach pad.\n A total of 13,591 net ounces of gold was sold from the San Antonio heap leach pad.\n During Q3 2023, processing of the remaining stockpile inventory was completed, and the Company does not\nanticipate any production henceforth.\nPermitting\nThe Company continued the various permitting activities starting in 2020. These activities consist of obtaining the permits\nfor the MIA and the change of use of land while continuing the work required to complete the environmental baseline study.\nApplications were submitted for four new mining claims, Sapuchi E-82/40881, Sapuchi 2 E-82/40882, Sapuchi 3 E-\n82/40883, and Sapuchi 4 E-82/40888.\nAll documentation required for the change of use land and EA permits were filed and the Company was awaiting the granting\nof these two permits by the Mexican government. In early December 2022, the director of SEMARNAT announced a\nmoratorium on all environmental permits for open pit operations, which will be denied with no approval process in place until\nfurther notice. Subsequently, the Company received communication that the MIA would not be approved. The approval\nprocess for environmental permits for mining may resume after the conclusion of the governor and presidential elections\nwhich will be held in July 2024, with the new president taking office in September 2024. In order to ensure that the San\nAntonio Gold Project would not be further delayed from the granting of the permits, management withdrew both permit\napplications with the intent to refile once the moratorium is lifted or a clear approval process is in place.\nExploration Program\nA two-phase 45,000-meter drilling campaign was initiated during 2021. The objective of the drill program was to conduct\nexploration and resource drilling at a spacing of 25 meters and historic drilling validation for the three main target areas:\nSapuchi, California and Golfo de Oro. The Company anticipates exploration potential to expand both oxide and sulphide\nresources.\n17\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company announced an initial open pit mineral resource estimate for the San Antonio Project (\"MRE\nSapuchi\"). See tables below. The 2022 MRE Sapuchi covers a portion of the Sapuchi – Cero Verde trend that encompasses\nfive deposits: Sapuchi, Golfo de Oro, California, Calvario and High Life over approximately 2.8 km along strike, a maximum\nwidth of 600 metres (m) to a maximum depth of 300 m below surface.\nThe MRE Sapuchi is based on 84,454 m of current and verified historic drilling in 579 holes, of which 27,870 m of drilling in\n177 holes were performed by the Company in 2021. Gold mineralization is hosted within altered hydrothermal breccia and\nsediments, as stockwork quartz veins and veinlets, adjacent to intrusions and fault structures and often associated with iron\ncarbonate minerals. Metallurgical testing has shown amenability of leaching in the oxide materials and recommendations\nof milling in the transition and sulphide zones. No drilling has occurred on the San Antonio Project since 2021 and there has\nnot been any ongoing exploration program in respect of the San Antonio Gold Project since then.\nFor further information regarding the San Antonio Project, please see the technical report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report\nfor the 2022 Mineral Resource Estimate on the San Antonio Project, Sonora, Mexico\", dated July 12, 2022 with an effective\ndate of June 24, 2022 on the Company’s website or under the Company’s issuer profile at www.sedarplus.ca and at\nwww.sec.gov.\nStockpile\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Sapuchi Minera commenced processing its stockpile inventory through sodium cyanide heap\nleach pads (\"heap leach pad\") and carbon-in-column processing plant. The Company realized its first gold sales in July\n2022 and generated gold sales totaling 10,478 net ounces in 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Sapuchi\nMinera sold 3,113 net ounces of gold sold. During Q3 2023, processing of the remaining stockpile inventory was completed,\nand the Company does not anticipate any production henceforth.\nOn September 30, 2022, the San Antonio gold project was written down to its net estimated recoverable amount of $35.0\nmillion ($nil net of the stream financing).\n2024 Objectives\nThe San Antonio gold project continues to be in care and maintenance. The Company awaits next steps from the\ngovernment of Mexico with respect to the permitting process and the status of open pit mining in the country. In addition,\nthe Board of Directors has authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Project.\n7. SUSTAINABILITY ACTIVITIES\nThe Company views sustainability as a key part of its strategy to create value for its shareholders and other stakeholders.\nThe Company focuses on the following key areas:\n Promoting the mining industry and its benefits to society;\n Promoting the Company’s values through our three pillars of Sustainability; Good neighbor, Engaged workforce\nand Environmental stewardship;\n Developing and maintaining strong relationships with First nations, stakeholders, the Federal, Provincial and\nMunicipal governments where the Company has activities and projects;\n Supporting the economic development of regions where it operates;\n Promoting diversity and inclusivity throughout the organization and the mining industry; and\n Encouraging investee companies and our contractors to adhere to the same areas of focus in sustainability.\n18\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nThe following are a few highlights from each of the projects:\nBarkerville\n Positive relationship with Lhtako Dené Nation since 2015. Agreements include engagement protocol (signed in\n2016), relationship agreements (2016) and life of project agreement (2020);\n Positive relationship with Xatsull First Nation and with Williams Lake First Nation (\"WLFN\") since 2016 and 2017\nrespectively;\n Positive relationship with the District of Wells in British Columbia since 2016 and a Memorandum of Understanding\nsigned in early 2022 to facilitate discussions for a project agreement;\n Open and transparent dialogue with the Ministry of Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation and The Ministry of\nthe Environment and Climate Change Strategy to ensure positive relations;\n Installation of a water treatment plant to treat contact water and effluent completed;\n Reclamation work started on the Mosquito Creek old mine site;\n Signature of Collaboration Agreement for the reclamation of the Jack of Clubs Lake mining legacy site with the\nCrown Contaminated Site Program of the BG Ministry of Forest.\n Initiation of the second Sustainable Workforce Initiative for underground miner training to provide skills training to\nsupport a local workforce;\n Funding provided to local organizations within the Wells and Barkerville communities to support various initiatives;\n The Company in partnership with the Lhtako Dené Nation, initiated and is developing a stewardship society focused\non the recovery of southern mountain caribou populations around Wells BC and, the enhancement and recovery\nactivities of Bowron River sockeye and chinook salmon runs; and\n On July 5, 2022, The Company and WLFN entered into a participation agreement.\nTintic\n Building positive relationships with the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Divisions of Air Quality and Water\nQuality.\n Implementation of environmental management plans for water, storm water and waste management for the Trixie\ntest mine.\n Building positive relationships with many stakeholders and local providers towards the development of the project.\n Submission of the LOM to the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining, the Small Source Exemption for Air Quality to\nthe Division of Air Quality.\nSapuchi Minera\n Reached a long-term agreement with Eijdo San Antonio, one of the primary impacted local communities.\n An environmental baseline study was completed.\n19\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\n8. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nConsolidated statements of loss\nThe following table presents summarized statements of loss for the three months March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands\nof dollars):\nThree mo nth s ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nRevenue (a) 1,767 3,451\nOperating expenses\nCost of sales (a) (1,974) (4,406)\nOther operating costs (b) (8,801) (10,553)\nGeneral and administrative (c) (6,015) (9,996)\nExploration and evaluation (70) (807)\nImpairment of assets (d) (5,415) —\nOperating loss (20,508) (22,311)\nOther income, net of other expense (e) 12,788 (1,755)\nLoss before income taxes (7,720) (24,066)\nIncome tax recovery (expense) (268) 729\nNet loss (7,988) (23,337)\n(a) For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized $1.7 million in revenues for\noperations at the Trixie test mine. In Q1 2023, The Company recognized $3.5 million in revenues from the\nsales of recovered gold and silver from its Bonanza Ledge II project, Trixie test mine operations and Sapuchi\nstockpile project. The cost of sales in relation to the gold and silver sold of $2.0 million was also recognized\nin the consolidated statement of loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $4.4 million).\n(b) For the three months ended March 31, 2024, other operating costs amounted to $8.8 million (2023 - $10.6\nmillion). These costs are related to the care and maintenance costs at the Cariboo Project, the Tintic test\nmine and the San Antonio Project.\n(c) General and administrative expenses of $6.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (2023 -\n$10 million) include $1.4 million of salaries and benefits (2023 - $3.6 million), $0.07 million of share-based\ncompensation expense (2023 - $1.9 million) and $4.5 million of administrative expenses (2023 - $4.4\nmillion) such as insurance fees and legal and other consulting fees. The decrease is primarily due to a\nlower compensation expense related mainly to the reduction of employees compared to the comparative\nperiod.\n(d) For the three months ended March 31, 2024, an impairment charge of $5.4 million was recorded on certain\nindividual assets at the Trixie test mine and at the Cariboo Gold Project.\n(e) For the three months ended March 31, 2024, other expense net of other income amounted to $12.7 million\n(2023 - $1.8 million). The amount includes the recognition of the accretion expense net of the change in\nfair value of the warrant liability and foreign exchange gains related to impact of variation in exchange rates.\n20\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\n9. CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes the cash flows (in thousands of dollars):\nThree mo nth s ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\n$ $\nCash flows\nOperations (11,235) (16,467)\nWorking capital items 2,174 3,628\nOperating activities (9,061) (12,839)\nInvesting activities (6,793) (23,085)\nFinancing activities 29,121 52,054\nIncrease (decrease) in cash before effects of exchange rate changes on cash 13,267 16,130\nEffects of exchange rate on changes on cash 805 91\nIncrease (decrease) in cash 14,072 16,221\nCash – beginning of period 43,455 105,944\nCash – end of period 57,527 122,165\nOperating Activities\nIn Q1 2024 cash flows used in operating activities amounted to $9.1 million compared to $12.8 million in Q1 2023. The\ndecrease in operating activities is mainly due to lower operating expenses at all the sites compared to 2023 and by the\ndecrease in general and administrative expenses. The variation in cash flows was primarily attributable to the changes in\nitems of working capital of $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the change in working\ncapital items of $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities amounted to $6.8 million in Q1 2024 compared to cash flows used in investing\nactivities of $23.1 million in Q1 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in mining development activities\nimpacting the level of additions in mining interests and property, plant and equipment. In addition, additional proceeds were\nreceived from the disposal of investments and property, plant and equipment and assets classified as held for sale.\nFinancing Activities\nThe cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to $29.1 million in Q1 2024 compared to cash flows provided by\nfinancing activities of $52.1 million in Q1 2023. In Q1 2023, the Company completed a bought deal financing of $51.8 million.\nIn Q1 2024, the Company drawn an amount of US$25.0 million ($33.9 million) under the Credit Facility.\nSince the inception of the Company up to the date of this report, a total of $640.6 million of capital has been raised through\nbrokered, non-brokered, stream financings, bought deal public offering and a credit facility.\n9.1. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Company has a negative working capital of $13.5 million, which included cash and cash equivalent\nbalance of $57.5 million. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of $519.1 million and incurred a net loss of $8.0\nmillion for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The working capital as at March 31, 2024 will not be sufficient to meet\nthe Company’s obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures through March 31, 2025. Management is aware, in\nmaking its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon\nthe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and accordingly, the appropriateness of the use of accounting\nprinciples applicable to a going concern. The accompanied unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements\n21\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\ndo not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, expenses and financial position classifications\nthat would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These adjustments could be material. In\nassessing whether a going concern assumption is appropriate, management considers all available information about the\nfuture, which is at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting period. In order to execute on its\nplanned activities, the Company will be required to secure additional financing in the future, which may be completed in\nseveral ways including, but not limited to, a combination of selling investments from its existing portfolio, project debt finance,\nofftake or royalty financing and other capital markets alternatives. However, there can be no assurance that the Company\nwill be able to obtain adequate financings in the future, or at terms favorable to the Company.\nSignificant variations in the liquidity and capital resources for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are explained under\nsection 9. Cash Flows. The Company is dependent upon raising funds in order to fund future capital expenditures and\ndevelopment programs. See section 13. Risk and Uncertainties of this MD&A for more details.\n10.

Cash Flows. The increase in mainly due to the amount drawn on the Credit Facility.\nThe increase in cash and cash equivalents explains mainly the increase in total current assets, offset by the disposal of a\nportion of the equipment classified as assets held for sale.\nThe increase in mining interests is mainly due to the detailed engineering on reclamation work, water treatment, waste\nmanagement and for the transmission line at the Cariboo Gold Project. The decrease in property, plant and equipment is\n22\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nmainly related to the impairment charge recorded and described in section 8. Financial Performance as well as depreciation\nexpense for the period. The increase in exploration and evaluation is largely related to the resource estimate and exploration\nprogram on the Tintic Project.\nOther investments decreased due to the overall change in fair values and partial dispositions of holdings in the Company’s\ninvestment portfolio.\nThe increase in current liabilities is mainly due to the amount drawn on the Credit Facility and the classification of the warrant\nliability as current liabilities as a consequence of the application of the Amendments to IAS 1 as described in Note 3 to the\nunaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nThe decrease in long-term debt is mainly due to a reclassification to short term of a debt that is maturing which is included\nin current liabilities. Similarly, the decrease in environmental rehabilitation provision is explained by the reclassification to\ncurrent liabilities in connection with the expected schedule of settlement.\n10.1. Investment in associates and other investments\nThe Company’s assets include a portfolio of shares, mainly of Canadian publicly traded exploration and development mining\ncompanies. The Company may, from time to time and without further notice except as required by law or regulations,\nincrease or decrease its investments at its discretion.\nFair value of marketable securities\nThe following table presents the carrying value and fair value of the remaining investments in marketable securities\n(excluding warrants and convertible debt) as at March 31, 2024 and December 31 2023 (in thousands of dollars):\nMarch 31 , 2024 Decembe r 31, 2023\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\nInvestments value(i) value(ii) value(i) value(ii)\n$ $ $ $\nAssociates 12,903 22,148 13,034 10,192\nOther 16,194 16,194 19,393 19,393\n29,097 38,342 32,427 29,585\n(i) The carrying value corresponds to the amount recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position, which is\nthe equity method for investments in associates and the fair value for the other investments, as per IFRS 9, Financial\nInstruments.\n(ii) The fair value corresponds to the quoted price of the investments on a recognized stock exchange for the respective\nperiod.\nMain Investments\nThe following table presents the main investments of the Company in marketable securities as at March 31, 2024:\nNumber of\nCompany Shares Held Ownership\n%\nFalco Resources Limited (associate) 46,885,240 17.3\nFalco Resources Limited (“Falco”)\nFalco's main asset is the Horne 5 gold project, for which the summarized results of an updated feasibility study were released\non March 24, 2021.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS\nThere are no significant off-balance sheet arrangements, other than contractual obligations and commitments mentioned\nabove.\n16. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe Company’s activities, being the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties in Canada and\nworldwide, is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Certain factors, including but not limited to the ones below,\ncould materially affect the Company’s financial condition and/or future operating results, and could cause actual events to\ndiffer materially from those described in forward-looking statements made by or related to the Company. Refer to the\n\"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" for more information. The reader should carefully consider these\nrisks as well as the information disclosed herein and, in the Company’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements and audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company’s view of risks is not static, and readers are cautioned that there can be no assurance that all risks to the\nCompany, at any point in time, can be accurately identified, assessed as to significance or impact, managed or effective\ncontrolled or mitigated. There can be additional new or elevated risks to the Company that are not described herein.\nFor a comprehensive discussion of the risk factors that may affect the Company, its business operations and financial\nperformance, refer to the risk disclosure under the heading \"Risk Factors\" contained in the Company’s annual information\nform dated March 28, 2024, for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"AIF\"), which disclosure is hereby incorporated by\nreference herein. The AIF and other publicly filed disclosure regarding the Company, which are available electronically on\nSEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development's issuer profile.\n28\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nRisks relating to Additional Financing and Dilution\nOsisko Development's development and exploration activities are subject to financing risks. At the present time, the\nCompany has exploration and development assets which may generate periodic revenues through test mining but has no\nmines in the commercial production stage that generate positive cash flows. The Company cautions that test mining at its\noperations could be suspended at any time. The Company’s ability to explore for and discover potential economic projects,\nand then to bring them into production, is highly dependent upon its ability to raise equity and debt capital in the financial\nmarkets. Any projects that the Company develops will require significant capital expenditures. To obtain such funds, the\nCompany may sell additional securities including, but not limited to, the Company’s shares or some form of convertible\nsecurity, the effect of which may result in a substantial dilution of the equity interests of the Company’s Shareholders.\nAlternatively, the Company may also sell a part of its interest in an asset in order to raise capital. There is no assurance\nthat the Company will be able to raise the funds required to continue its exploration programs and finance the development\nof any potentially economic deposit that is identified on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to obtain the necessary\nfinancing(s) could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s growth strategy, results of operations, financial condition\nand project scheduling.\nRisks related to mining operations\nMining operations are and will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration, development and\nproduction of mineral resources and mineral reserves including unusual or unexpected geological formations and other\nconditions such as formation pressures, fire, power outages, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to\nobtain suitable machinery, equipment or labour, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property, and\npossible environmental damage that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate\nor adequately mitigate. The Company may be subject to liability for pollution, cave-ins or hazards against which it cannot\ninsure or against which it may elect not to insure. The payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial position of the Company.\nMajor expenditures are required to develop metallurgical processes and to construct mining and processing facilities at a\nparticular site. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are:\nthe particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which are highly\nvolatile; and governmental regulations, including those relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, allowable\nproduction, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection.\nOperations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\nCertain operations of the Company including the test mining at Bonanza Ledge II Project and Trixie test mine, have operated\nwithout the benefit of a feasibility study including mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as\na result, there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such\nrecovery. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that\ncommercial production will commence, continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved.\nThe failure to commence or continue production would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability to generate\nrevenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse\nimpact on the Company’s cash flow and potential profitability.\nNegative Operating Cash Flow\nThe Company has negative cash flow from operations. As a result of the expected expenditures to be incurred by the\nCorporation for the development of the Company’s material projects, the Company anticipates that negative operating cash\nflows will continue until one or both of the Company’s material projects enters commercial production (if at all). There can\nbe no assurance that the Company will generate positive cash flow from operations in the future. The Company will require\nadditional capital in order to fund its future activities for its material projects. To the extent that the Company continues to\nhave negative operating cash flow in future periods, it may need to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to fund such\nnegative cash flow. Furthermore, additional financing, whether through the issue of additional equity and/or debt securities\n29\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nand/or project level debt, will be required to continue the development of the Company’s material projects and there is no\nassurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available or that these financings will be on terms at least\nas favourable to the Company as those previously obtained, or at all. Failure to obtain additional financing or to achieve\nprofitability and positive operating cash flows will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of\noperations.\nNo Earnings and History of Losses\nThe business of developing and exploring resource properties involves a high degree of risk and, therefore, there is no\nassurance that current exploration and test mining programs will result in profitable operations. The Company has not\ndetermined whether any of its properties contain economically recoverable reserves of mineralized material and currently\nhas minimal or no revenues from its projects; therefore, the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows from its\noperations. There can be no assurance that significant additional losses will not occur in the future. The Company’s\noperating expenses and capital expenditures may increase in future years with advancing exploration, development, and/or\nproduction from the Company’s properties. The Company does not anticipate receiving sufficient revenues from operations\nto offset operational expenditures in the foreseeable future and expects to incur losses until such time as one or more of its\nproperties enters into commercial production and generates sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. There is no\nassurance that any of the Company’s properties will eventually graduate to commercial operation. There is also no\nassurance that new capital will become available, and if it is not, the Company may be forced to substantially curtail or\ncease operations.\nForeign Exchange Risks\nThe Company is subject to currency risks. The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar, which is exposed to\nfluctuations against other currencies. The Company’s activities are located in Canada, Mexico and the U.S.A., and as such\nmany of its expenditures and obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos. The Company maintains its\nprincipal office in Montreal (Canada), maintains cash accounts in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos and\nhas monetary assets and liabilities in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos.\nThe Company’s assets and liquidities are significantly affected by changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar and\nCanadian/Mexican peso exchange rates. Most expenses are currently denominated in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and\nMexican pesos. Exchange rate movements can therefore have a significant impact on the Company’s costs. The\nappreciation of non-Canadian dollar currencies against the Canadian dollar can increase the costs of the Company’s\nactivities.\nRisks relating to Taxation Laws\nThe Company has operations and conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and it is subject to the taxation laws of each\nsuch jurisdiction. These taxation laws are complicated and subject to change. The Company may also be subject to review,\naudit and assessment in the ordinary course. Any such changes in taxation law or reviews and assessments could result in\nhigher taxes being payable or require payment of taxes due from previous years, which could adversely affect the\nCompany’s liquidities. Taxes may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to repatriate earnings and otherwise deploy\nits assets.\nPermits, Licences and Approvals\nThe operations of the Company require licences and permits from various governmental authorities. The Company believes\nit holds or is in the process of obtaining all necessary licences and permits to carry on the activities which it is currently\nconducting under applicable laws and regulations. Such licences and permits are subject to changes in regulations and in\nvarious operating circumstances. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary licences\nand permits that may be required to maintain its mining activities, construct mines or milling facilities and commence\noperations of any of its exploration properties. In addition, if the Company proceeds to production on any exploration\nproperty, it must obtain and comply with permits and licences which may contain specific conditions concerning operating\n30\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nprocedures, water use, the discharge of various materials into or on land, air or water, waste disposal, spills, environmental\nstudies, abandonment and restoration plans and financial assurances. There can be no assurance that the Company will\nbe able to obtain such permits and licences or that it will be able to comply with any such conditions.\nMineral resource and mineral reserve estimates have inherent uncertainty\nMineral resource and mineral reserve figures are only estimates. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on\nknowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results and industry practices. While the Company believes that the\nmineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, as applicable, in respect of properties in which the Company holds a direct\ninterest reflect best estimates, the estimating of mineral resources and mineral reserves is a subjective process and the\naccuracy of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, the\naccuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting available engineering\nand geological information. There is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource and mineral reserve estimate and the\nactual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from estimates. Estimated mineral\nresources and mineral reserves may have to be re-estimated based on changes in prices of gold or other minerals, further\nexploration or development activity or actual production experience. This could materially and adversely affect estimates of\nthe volume or grade of mineralization, estimated recovery rates or other important factors that influence such estimates. In\naddition, mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resource estimate will\nultimately be reclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not\nhave demonstrated economic viability.\nEconomics of developing mineral properties\nMineral exploration and development is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. While the discovery of an ore body\nmay result in substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are commercially mineable and ultimately developed\ninto producing mines. There is no assurance that any exploration properties will be commercially mineable.\nShould any mineral resources exist, substantial expenditures will be required to confirm mineral reserves which are sufficient\nto commercially mine and to obtain the required environmental approvals and permitting required to commence commercial\noperations. The decision as to whether a property contains a commercially viable mineral deposit and should be brought\ninto production will depend upon the results of exploration programs, preliminary economic assessment and/or feasibility\nstudies, and the recommendations of duly qualified engineers and/or geologists, all of which involves significant expense.\nThis decision will involve consideration and evaluation of several significant factors including, but not limited to: (a) costs of\nbringing a property into production, including exploration and development work, preparation of, if applicable, preliminary\neconomic assessment and production feasibility studies and construction of production facilities; (b) availability and costs\nof financing; (c) ongoing costs of production; (d) metal prices; (e) environmental compliance regulations and restraints\n(including potential environmental liabilities associated with historical exploration activities); and (f) political climate and/or\ngovernmental regulation and control. Development projects are also subject to the successful completion of engineering\nstudies, issuance of necessary governmental permits, and availability of adequate financing. Development projects have\nno operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow.\nUninsured Risks and Hazards\nMining is capital intensive and subject to a number of risks and hazards, including environmental pollution, accidents or\nspills, industrial and transportation accidents, labour disputes, changes in the regulatory environment, natural phenomena\n(such as inclement weather conditions, earthquakes, pit wall failures and cave-ins) and encountering unusual or unexpected\ngeological conditions. Such risk and hazards might impact the Company’s business. Consequently, many of the foregoing\nrisks and hazards could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company’s mineral properties or future processing\nfacilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in or interruption of or cessation of their exploration or\ndevelopment activities, delay in or inability to receive required regulatory approvals, or costs, monetary losses and potential\nlegal liability and adverse governmental action. Osisko Development may be subject to liability or sustain loss for certain\nrisks and hazards against which it does not or cannot insure or against which it may reasonably elect not to insure because\nof the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could result in material economic harm to the Company.\n31\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\nFluctuation in market value of Osisko Development Common Shares\nThe market price of Osisko Development Common Shares is affected by many variables not directly related to the corporate\nperformance of the Company, including the strength of the economy generally, the availability and attractiveness of\nalternative investments, and the breadth of the public market for the stock. The effect of these and other factors on the\nmarket price of the Osisko Development Shares in the future cannot be predicted and may cause decreases in asset values,\nwhich may result in impairment losses.\n17. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (ICFR)\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be\ndisclosed in reports files with the securities regulatory authorities are recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a\ntimely fashion. The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by\nthe Company in such reports is then accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management to ensure timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Management regularly reviews disclosure controls and procedures; however, they\ncannot provide an absolute level of assurance because of the inherent limitations in control systems to prevent or detect all\nmisstatements due to error or fraud. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, along with Management, have\nevaluated and concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and appropriately designed\nas at March 31, 2024.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls\nover financial reporting. The Company’s internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with IFRS. Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management\nevaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. In making the\nassessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, the Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, together with Management, have evaluated whether there were changes to the ICFR\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,\nthe Company’s ICFR. No such changes were identified through their evaluation. The Company’s management, including\nthe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those\nsystems determined to be properly designed and effective can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met.\nLimitations of Controls and Procedures\nManagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and\nprocedures or internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system\nmust reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the reality judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or\nmistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more\npeople, or by unauthorized override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving\nits stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective\ncontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n32\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024\n18.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\nEstimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including\nexpectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The determination of estimates\nrequires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience and current\nand expected economic conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions as well as critical judgments in applying the Company’s accounting policies\nare detailed in the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAll financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. The fair value is based on quoted\nmarket prices, unless the financial instruments are not traded in an active market. In this case, the fair value is determined\nby using valuation techniques like discounted cash flows, the Black-Scholes option pricing model or other valuation\ntechniques. Measurement in subsequent periods depends on the classification of the financial instrument. A description of\nfinancial instruments and their fair value is included in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n21.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nThis MD&A contains certain non-IFRS (as defined herein) measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" (or \"AISC\") and \"cash\ncost\". All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative,\nexploration, other expenses and sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS\nmeasure reported by the Company on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general\nand administration costs and royalties but exclude depreciation, reclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs\nfor the life of the mine. Management believes that such measures provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the\nperformance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and,\ntherefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide\nadditional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in\naccordance with IFRS, such as Cost of sales.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the statements of historical fact contained herein, the information presented in this MD&A constitutes \"forward-\nlooking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian Securities Laws concerning the business, operations, plans\nand financial performance and condition of the Company (collectively, the \"Forward-Looking Information\").

As such, the information contained in this MD&A concerning mineral\nproperties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information\nmade public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\n1. OUR BUSINESS\nOsisko Development is a Canadian-based exploration and development company focused on past-producing properties\nlocated in mining friendly jurisdictions with district scale potential. The Company’s objective is to become a North American\nintermediate producer of precious metals, through curating and advancing a portfolio of development projects and\ninvestments with potential for value creation. The principal mining assets wholly owned through subsidiaries of the Company\nas of June 30, 2024, are as follows:\n• Cariboo Gold Project (Permitting – British Columbia, Canada) (the \"Cariboo Gold Project\"), owned and operated\nby Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd. (\"Barkerville\").\n• Tintic Project (including, the Trixie test mine located within the Company’s wider Tintic Project) (Test mining and\nexploration – Utah, United States) (the \"Tintic Project\"), owned and operated by Tintic Consolidated Metals LLC\n(\"Tintic\").\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Project, which includes\nexploring the potential for a financial or strategic partner in the asset or for a full or partial sale of the asset. The Company\nhas engaged a financial advisor in connection with the strategic review.\nAs an exploration and development stage corporation, the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows to advance the\nevaluation and development of its various projects and properties and has historically relied on equity and debt funding to\nmaintain financial liquidity. Continued adequate financial liquidity is dependent on management's ability to secure additional\n4\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nfinancings in the future; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financings\nin the future, or at terms favourable to the Company (refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\").\nThe accompanied unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of\naccounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities\nin the normal course of business as they come due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate,\nManagement takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve months\nfrom the end of the reporting period. The working capital position as at June 30, 2024, will not be sufficient to meet the\nCompany’s obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures up to the period ending June 30, 2025. Management is\naware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt\nupon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and accordingly, the appropriateness of the use of accounting\nprinciples applicable to a going concern.\n2.

HIGHLIGHTS – Q2 2024\nThe following summarizes Osisko Development's financial and operational highlights from Q2 2024:\nSustainability and Permitting\nThere are no environmental issues to report in Q2 2024.\nOperations and financial\nThree months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n• In Q2 2024, the Company generated revenues of $2.6 million and incurred an operating loss of $13.4 million\ncompared to $10.8 million and $14.8 million respectively, in Q2 2023. The decrease in revenues in Q2 2024\ncompared to Q2 2023 is mainly attributable to the reduction of sales from the Tintic Project and the San Antonio\nProject as both projects were in care and maintenance during Q2 2024. The lower operating loss in Q2 2024\ncompared to Q2 2023 is primarily due to the decrease in the level of activities.\n5\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\n• In Q2 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $28.7 million compared to a net loss of $13.3 million in Q2 2023.\nThe increase in net loss is primarily due to a higher foreign exchange loss and a lower fair value gain adjustment\nof the warrant liability in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023, offset by the reasons noted above.\n• The net cash flows used in operating activities in Q2 2024 amounted to $13.2 million compared to $11.7 million in\nQ2 2023. The increase in cash flows used in operating activities is primarily due to the decrease in revenues and\nthe related impact on each project’s respective working capital and partially offset by the reduction in the general\noperating activities at the Tintic Project and the San Antonio Project.\n• Additions to mining interests, property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation expenses for Q2 2024\namounted to $12.0 million compared to $22.1 million in Q2 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in\nmining development activities including the decrease in exploration spending at the Cariboo Gold Project and at the\nTintic Project.\n• Net cash outflows used in financing activities amounted to $1.6 million in Q2 2024 compared to $1.6 million in Q2\n2023.\nSix months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n• During the first six months of 2024, the Company generated revenue of $4.4 million and incurred an operating loss\nof $34.0 million compared to $14.3 million and $37.1 million respectively, in 2023. The decrease in revenue is mainly\nattributable to the decrease of revenue from Bonanza Ledge II and the reduction of sales from the Tintic Project\nand the San Antonio Project as both projects were in care and maintenance during the first six months of 2024. The\nlower operating loss is primarily due to the decrease in the overall level of activities offset by an impairment of\nassets of $5.4 million.\n• During the first six months of 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $36.7 million compared to a similar net loss\nof $36.7 million in YTD 2023. The decrease in operating loss in 2024, due to the reasons noted above, was offset\nby a higher foreign exchange loss recorded in 2024 compared to a gain in the corresponding period in 2023.\n• The net cash flows used in operating activities in 2024 amounted to $22.3 million compared to $24.6 million in 2023.\nThe decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the general operating activities at the Tintic Project and the San\nAntonio Project, including the impact on each project’s respective working capital.\n• Additions to mining interests, property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation expenses in the first six\nmonths of 2024 amounted to $22.1 million compared to $45.7 million in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a\nreduction in mining development activities, including a decrease in exploration spending at the Cariboo Gold Project\nand at the Tintic Project.\n• Net cash inflows from financing activities amounted to $27.6 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to net\ncash inflows of $50.5 million in 2023. In 2023, the Company completed a bought deal financing of $51.8 million and\nin 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement as described below.\nExploration Activities\n• On April 26, 2024, the Company announced the filing of a technical report for the updated mineral resource estimate\non its 100%-owned underground Trixie deposit within the Company’s wider Tintic Project.

Cariboo Gold Project – British Columbia, Canada\nThe Cariboo Gold Project is an advanced stage gold exploration project 100%-owned by the Company located in the historic\nWells-Barkerville mining camp, in the District of Wells, central British Columbia, Canada, that extends for approximately 77\nkilometres from northwest to southeast. The Company’s total land package consists of 443 mineral titles and covers an\narea of approximately 185,640 hectares. On November 21, 2019, Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (\"OGR\") acquired the Cariboo\n8\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nGold Project through the acquisition of Barkerville. The project was part of the OGR contributed assets that created the\nCompany on November 25, 2020.\nTechnical reports and mineral resource estimate\nThe Company completed a Feasibility Study (\"FS\") for the Cariboo Gold Project with an effective date of January 12, 2023.\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by the\ntechnical report filed in respect of the FS on the Cariboo Gold Project titled \"Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project,\nDistrict of Well, British Columbia, Canada\", dated January 10, 2023 (as amended January 12, 2023) with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022 (the \"Cariboo FS\"), which was prepared for the Company by Colin Hardie, P.

Information relating to the Cariboo Gold Project and the Cariboo FS\nprovided herein is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Cariboo FS, which is available electronically on the Company’s\nwebsite or on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under the Company’s issuer profile, including\nthe assumptions, qualifications and limitations therein.\nThe Cariboo FS contemplates a staged, lower capital intensity project design with scalable infrastructure to account for the\ncurrent global inflationary environment. Management believes that this approach to developing the Cariboo Gold Project\nmay mitigate development capital intensity risks while providing an opportunity to maximize margins. The Company\nanticipates that the potential development of the Cariboo Gold Project may provide a basis for progress towards the\nestablishment of a broader mining district camp, including development of multiple deposits over several trends totaling\napproximately 80 km of mineralization.

The Mineral Resource Estimate conforms to the 2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves\nand follows the 2019 CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines.\n3. A total of 481 vein zones were modelled for the Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley), Island Mountain (Shaft and Mosquito),\nBarkerville Mountain (BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee) deposits and one gold zone for Bonanza Ledge. A minimum true\nthickness of 2.0 m was applied, using the Au gold grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when\nnot assayed.\n10\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\n4. The estimate is reported for a potential underground scenario at a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au, except for Bonanza Ledge\nat a cut- off grade of 3.5 g/t Au. The cut-off grade for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee deposits\nwas calculated using a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $54.32/t;\na processing and transport cost of $22.29/t;a G&A plus Environmental cost of $15.31/t; and a sustaining CAPEX cost of\n$31.19/t. The cut-off grade for the Bonanza Ledge deposit was calculated using a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD\nexchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $79.13/t; a processing and transport cost of $65.00/t; and a G&A plus\nEnvironmental cost of $51.65/t. The cut-off grades should be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing market conditions\n(metal prices, exchange rate, mining cost, etc.).\n5. Bulk density varies from 2.69 g/ cm3 to 3.20 g/ cm3.\n6. A four-step capping procedure was applied to composited data. Restricted search ellipsoids ranged from 7 to 50 g/t Au\nat four different distances ranging from 25 m to 250 m. High-grades at Bonanza Ledge were capped at 70 g/t Au on 2.0\nm composited data.\n7. The gold Mineral Resources for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee vein zones were estimated\nusing Datamine StudioTM RM 1.9 software using hard boundaries on composited assays. The silver Mineral Resources\nand the dilution halo gold mineralization were estimated using Datamine StudioTM RM Pro 1.11. The OK method was\nused. Mineral Resources for Bonanza Ledge were estimated using GEOVIA GEMSTM 6.7 software using hard\nboundaries on composited assays. The OK method was used to interpolate a block model.\n8. Results are presented in situ. Calculations used metric units (meters, tonnes, g/t). Any discrepancies in the totals are\ndue to rounding effects.\nMineral Reserves Estimate\nProbable Mineral Reserves of 16.7 Mt grading 3.78 g/t Au for 2.03 Moz of contained gold in underground deposits, as\ndefined below, have an effective date of December 6, 2022 and form the basis of the Cariboo FS. Only Mineral Resources\nthat were classified as Measured and Indicated were given economic attributes in the mine design and when demonstrating\neconomic viability were classified as Mineral Reserves, incorporating an external mining dilution factor of 8% into the Mineral\nReserves estimate.\nTable 6: Cariboo Mineral Reserves Statement – December 6, 2022\nTonnes G old Grade Contained Gold Silver Grade Contained\nClassification / Deposit (000's) (g/t) (000's oz) (g/t) Silver (oz)\nProven — — — — —\nProbable\nCow 4,127 3.41 453 0.08 11,018\nValley 3,445 3.70 410 0.14 15,059\nShaft 7,962 3.87 990 0.02 4,473\nMosquito 603 4.93 95 0.03 619\nLowhee 567 4.56 83 0.21 3,786\nTotal Proven and Probable Reserves 16,703 3.78 2,031 0.07 34,955\nNotes:\n1. Totals may not add up due to rounding.\n2. Mineral Reserves have been estimated in accordance with CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral\nReserves (2014), which are incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.\n3. Mineral Reserves used the following assumptions: US$1,700/oz gold price, USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27, and\nvariable cut- off value from 1.70 g/t to 4.00 g/t Au\n4. Mineral Reserves include both internal and external dilution along with mining recovery. The external dilution is\nestimated to be 8%. The average mining recovery factor was set at 93.6% to account for ore left in each block in the\nmargins of the deposit.\n11\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nThe mineral resource estimate is built upon over 650,000 meters of core from the 2015 to 2021 drill campaigns, and\nhistorically verified drill data using a total of 4,064 drill holes. A strong understanding of the controls of mineralization enabled\nOsisko Development's technical team to construct a mineral resource estimate constrained by lithology, alteration, structure\nand mineralization.\nOn December 31, 2022, the Cariboo gold project was written down to its net estimated recoverable amount of $435.7 million\nwhich was determined by the value-in-use using a discounted cash-flow approach and reflected as an impairment of Mining\nInterests. The main valuation inputs used were the cash flows expected to be generated by the production and sale of gold\nfrom the Cariboo gold project over the estimated life of the mine, based on the expected long-term gold price per ounce\ncosts inflation forecast and the discount rate of 12.6% applied to the cash flow projections.\nPermitting and EA Process\nOsisko Development started the EA Process in the spring of 2019 for the Cariboo Gold Project.\nOn October 27, 2021, the Province of British Columbia, Lhtako Dené First Nation and the Company announced the approval\nof amendments to Mines Act Permits M-238 and M-198 allowing for the expansion of the existing Bonanza Ledge II\nunderground mine. At the time, these amendments supported the employment of additional workers at the mine. The\nexpansion of the Bonanza Ledge II Project allowed for continuity of certain mining activities while the Cariboo Gold Project\nenvironmental assessment was underway. In July 2021, the province of British Columbia authorized a permit to extract a\nbulk sample of 10,000 tonnes of mineralized material, the development of a portal and 2,200 m of drift to access the mineral\ndeposit.\nOn October 10, 2023, the Company announced that it received an Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") Certificate for the\nCompany’s 100%-owned Cariboo Gold Project. The EA Certificate was granted by the Environmental Assessment Office\nof the Province of British Columbia (\"EAO\") and is supported by approval decisions from The Honourable George Heyman,\nMinister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy and The Honourable Josie Osbourne, Minister of Energy, Mines and\nLow Carbon Innovation. Receipt of the EA Certificate successfully concludes the EA process for the Cariboo Gold Project\nlaunched in October 2019, and completed in consultation with and support of the First Nations partners.\nOn May 31, 2023, the Company submitted its Joint Permit Application (\"JPA\") and passed the screening phase of the permit\nin September 2023 after submitting the final, revised application. Through 4 rounds of review from the Mine Review\nCommittee, the Company responded to, addressed, and closed over 1,800 comments from various stakeholders. The Mines\nAct and Environmental Management Act permits have been drafted and are currently under review by the Company and\nthe Mine Review Committee since May 2024. The Company anticipates completing its permit application referral and\nreceiving final permits in Q3 2024.\n12\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nCariboo Gold Project – Permitting Timeline Summary\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Cariboo Gold Project is in advanced stages of permitting and the history of the process is\nsummarized in the following highlights:\n• Signing Ceremony on October 23, 2022 with Lhtako Dené First Nation's Elders and Members in Wells and Quesnel\nwas an important event for the life of project agreement between Lhtako Dene First Nation and Osisko Development\nhighlighting the importance of our partnership and mutual support and benefits.\n• The Revised Application for the EA Process was submitted to the EAO of British Columbia on October 14, 2022 for\nthe Cariboo Gold Project.

Tintic Project – Utah, U.S.A.\nThe Tintic Project is located in western Utah County, approximately 64 km south of Provo, Utah and 95 km south of Salt\nLake City. The property on which the Trixie test mine or Trixie deposit is located encompasses most of the East Tintic\nDistrict, surrounding and immediately east of the incorporated town of Eureka. The area of the Tintic Project owned or\ncontrolled by Osisko Development comprises 1,370 claims totaling 7,601 ha (18,783 acres) of patented mining claims and\na further 110 mining claims of approximately 731 ha (1,807 acres), which are overwhelmingly leased patented mining claims.\nOsisko Development owns a small and varying percentage, interest or royalty in a number of other claims outside the main\nclaim package.\nScientific and technical information relating to the Tintic Project and the updated mineral resource estimate for the Trixie\ndeposit (the \"2024 Trixie MRE\"), including information provided in the table \"2024 Trixie MRE (all zones)\" and the\n14\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nassumptions, qualifications and limitations thereof, is supported by the technical report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report,\nMineral Resource Estimate for the Trixie Deposit, Tintic Project, Utah, United States of America\" and dated April 25, 2024\n(with an effective date of March 14, 2024), prepared for the Company by independent representatives of Micon International\nLimited, being William Lewis, P. Geo, and Alan J. San Martin, MAusIMM(CP). Reference should be made to the full text of\nthe 2024 Trixie MRE technical report, which was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and is available electronically on\nthe Company’s website, SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under the Company’s issuer profile.\nAcquisition of Tintic\nOn May 27, 2022, Osisko Development acquired 100% of Tintic through the purchase of: (i) IG Tintic's direct 75% ownership\nin Tintic; and (ii) all issued and outstanding stock of Chief Consolidated Mining Company (\"Chief\"). Immediately following\nthe closing of the transaction, Chief completed a merger with a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (the \"Merger\"),\nsuch that, following completion of the Merger, Chief is now owned by the Company. The total consideration to the vendors\nin the aggregate amount of approximately US$156.6 million ($199.5 million), comprised of: (i) cash payments of\napproximately US$58.7 million ($74.7 million), (ii) the issuance to the sellers of convertible instruments amounting to $10.8\nmillion (iii) the issuance of 12,049,449 common shares of the Company and, (iv) Deferred consideration and contingent\npayments fair valued at $15.1 million.\nThe deferred payments consist of an amount of US$12.5 million payable in equal instalments annually over five years in\ncash or shares at the Company’s election; (ii) two 1% NSR royalty grants, each with a 50% buyback right in favour of the\nCompany for US$7.5 million which is exercisable within 5 years; (iii) a right to receive the financial equivalent of 10% of the\nnet smelter returns from stockpiled mineralized material extracted from the Tintic Project since January 1, 2018 and sitting\non surface; and (iv) US$10 million contingent upon commencement of production at the Burgin Mine.\nWith the completion of the transaction, the Company acquired 100% ownership of the producing Trixie test mine, as well\nas mineral claims covering more than 17,000 acres in Central Utah's historic Tintic Mining District. Tintic's ongoing\nexploration work has demonstrated potential for expansion and further discovery both at the Trixie test mine and the broader\nland package. It is hoped that the acquisition of Tintic will, as a result of exploration efforts, serve to accelerate the\nCompany’s path towards becoming a mid-tier gold producer and add further opportunity to explore and develop another\nproject in its portfolio.\nExploration Program\nThe Tintic Project consists of 23 past producing precious and base metal mines located in the East Tintic Mining District,\nUtah, 95 km southwest of Salt Lake City. The Tintic Project is comprised of more than 20,500 acres (8,333 ha), including\n18,783 acres (7,601 ha) of patented mining claims.\nIn 2022, the Company completed 28 surface reverse circulation (\"RC\") drill holes near Trixie totaling approximately 8,442\nm and 62 underground diamond drill (\"DD\") holes in the 625 level at Trixie totaling approximately 3,232 m using two surface\nRC rigs and two underground diamond drill rigs. Continuous underground face samples were collected along all\ndevelopment at Trixie, and together with drill results, formed the basis of an initial mineral resource estimate at Trixie\ncompleted in January 2023.\nIn 2023, the Company completed 73 underground DD holes at Trixie totaling approximately 6,028 m (19,776 ft). All assays\nfrom 2023 have now been finalized. For additional information please refer to the Company’s news release dated February\n22, 2024.\nBetween December 2023 and May 2024, the Company completed two surface DD holes at the Big Hill target area totaling\napproximately 2,920 m (9,581 ft). Results of the drilling are currently being used to vector towards future exploration targets.\nIn 2023, the Company completed a total of 6,028 m (19,776 ft) of underground drilling in 73 diamond drill holes at Trixie.\nAssays were finalized up to hole TRXU-DD-23-069 and were included in the 2024 Trixie MRE.\n15\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nThe 2024 Trixie MRE incorporated an additional 1,674 underground chip samples over 1,678 m (5,507 ft) of underground\ndevelopment, and 7,385 m of drilling (24,229 ft) in 122 holes completed by the Company since the release of the Initial\nTrixie MRE, with an effective date of January 10, 2023.\n2024 Trixie MRE Statement\nContained Contained\nTonnes Au Grade Gold Ag Grade Silver\nClassification (000's) (g/t) (000's oz) (g/t) (000's oz)\nMeasured 120 27.36 105 61.73 238\nIndicated 125 11.17 45 59.89 240\nMeasured and Indicated 245 19.11 150 60.8 478\nInferred 202 7.8 51 48.55 315\nNotes\n1. Effective date of the 2024 Trixie MRE is March 14, 2024.\n2. Each of Mr. William Lewis, P.Geo., of Micon International Limited and Alan J. San Martin, MAusIMM(CP), of Micon\nInternational Limited (i) has reviewed and validated the 2024 Trixie MRE, (ii) is considered to be independent of the\nCompany for purposes of Section 1.5 of NI 43-101, and (iii) is a \"qualified person\" within the meaning of NI 43-101.\n3. The mineral resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining (\"CIM\"), Metallurgy and Petroleum's \"CIM\nDefinition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\" adopted by the CIM council.\n4. Mineral resources are reported when they are within potentially mineable shapes derived from a stope optimizer\nalgorithm, assuming an underground longhole stoping mining method with stopes of 6.1 m x 6.1 m x minimum 1.5 m\ndimensions.\n5. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n6. Geologic modelling was completed by Osisko Development modeling geologist Jody Laing, P.Geo, using Leapfrog Geo\nsoftware. The 2024 Trixie MRE was completed by Osisko Development chief resource geologist, Daniel Downton, P.Geo\nusing Datamine Studio RM 2.0 software. William Lewis and Alan J. San Martin of Micon International Limited\nindependently reviewed and validated the mineral resource model.\n7. The estimate is reported for an underground mining scenario and with USD assumptions. The cut-off grade of 4.32 g/t\nAu was calculated using a gold price of US$1,750/oz, a CAD: USD exchange rate of 1.3; total mining, processing and\nG&A costs of US$168.04/imperial ton; a refining cost of US$2.65/ounce; a combined royalty of 4.50%; and an average\nmetallurgical gold recovery of 80%.\n8. The stope optimizer algorithm evaluated the resources based on a gold equivalent grade which incorporates the silver\ngrade estimate and assumes a silver price of US$23/oz and metallurgical silver recovery of 45%.\n9. Average bulk density values in the mineralized domains were assigned to the T2 (2.955 T/m3), T3 (2.638 T/m3), T4\n(2.618 T/m3), Wild Cat, and 40 Fault (2.621 T/m3), and 75-85 (2.617 T/m3) domains.\n10. Inverse Distance Squared interpolation method was used with a parent block size of 1.2 m x 2.4 m x 2.4 m.\n11. The 2024 Trixie MRE results are presented in-situ. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes, g/t). The number of\ntonnes is rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.\n12. Neither the Company nor Micon International Limited’s qualified persons are aware of any known environmental,\npermitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the\nmineral resource estimate other than disclosed in the 2024 Trixie MRE.\nDevelopments in 2024 Objectives\nIn Q2 2024, the Company continued surface exploration drilling for porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum at the Big Hill target\nwith one diamond drill rig. A total of 980.5 meters were drilled in Q2 2024 at Big Hill, which completed the initial proposed\ndrill plan for Big Hill. At Trixie, 150 meters were drilled in January 2024 in connection with the first hole testing for a porphyry\ntarget below Trixie. The drilling of porphyry targets was completed in early May 2024.\n16\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nData compilation from historic mines in the area is ongoing and anticipated to generate additional drill targets on the greater\nTintic Project property.\nThe development of an underground ramp, which commenced in July 2022, was completed to the 625 level in Q3 2023 with\nthe breakthrough occurring at the end of September. The Company anticipates that the decline ramp will improve\nunderground access for exploration and may potentially support an increase in productivity and mining rates in the future.\nThe ability to achieve any increase in production and the capital required to increase production are the subject of pending\ntechnical work. There can be no assurance that technical work will provide justification for further development, support the\nability to increase production or demonstrate the ability to increase production through a low-capital expenditure expansion\nof the existing facilities. The ability to recommence and expand operations is subject to risks which include the possible\nneed for additional or amended permits, licenses and approvals, risks related to mining operations, the need for additional\ncapital and/or operating expenditures, commodity prices justifying such work, potential scarcity of employees, environmental\nrisks and approvals and the limited knowledge of the mineralized material available on site.\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching\nat the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves,\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any\nparticular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects\nhave a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December\n2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023 and, suspended again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining\nat Trixie re-commences, there is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated\nproduction costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s\nability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs may have\na material adverse impact on the Company’s cash flow and potential profitability. The Company cautions that historically,\nsuch projects have a much higher economic or technical risks. In continuing current operations at Trixie, the Company has\nnot based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability.\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company announced the 2024 Trixie MRE. Compared to the previous 2023 Trixie MRE, contained\ngold ounces in measured and indicated resources decreased by 29% and inferred resources decreased by 79% primarily\ndue to lower estimated grades that incorporated an updated geologic model interpretation and conversion of inferred\nresources. Drill results and underground mapping from the 2023 exploration program improved the knowledge of the extent\nand distribution of mineralization, resulting in modeling improvements to both mineralization and the historical mine shape\nmodel. A technical report in respect of the 2024 Trixie MRE titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate\nfor the Trixie Deposit, Tintic Project, Utah, United States of America\" and dated April 25, 2024 (with an effective date of\nMarch 14, 2024) was subsequently filed on SEDAR+ and EDGAR under the Company’s issuer profile on April 26, 2024.\nThe test mining operations at Trixie were suspended in December 2023 and are expected to remain in care and\nmaintenance for the foreseeable future. As such, on December 31, 2023, an impairment charge of $160.5 million on the\nTrixie test mine was recorded and the net assets of the Trixie test mine were written down to their net estimated recoverable\namount (including mining interest and property, plant and equipment). Management continues to review its options for next\nsteps at the Tintic Project.\nPlease see the caution section \"Risk Factors: Operations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\".\n6.4. San Antonio Gold Project – Sonora State, Mexico\nIn addition to the Cariboo Gold Project and Tintic Project, the Company also owns the San Antonio Gold Project. The San\nAntonio Gold Project is not considered a material property of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and the date of this MD&A,\nand has been under care and maintenance since Q3 2023. No drilling has occurred on the San Antonio Project since 2021\nand there has not been any ongoing exploration program in respect of the San Antonio Gold Project since then.\n17\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nThe San Antonio Gold Project is a past-producing oxide copper mine. In 2020, following the acquisition of this project, the\nCompany concentrated its efforts in obtaining the required permits and amendments to the permits to perform its activities.\nThe Company has filed preventive reports for the processing of the gold stockpile on site and for a drilling program for the\nSapuchi, Golfo de Oro and California zones.\nThe Company also initiated the following activities:\n• Commencement of the Environmental Impact Manifest (or Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental (\"MIA\"));\n• An environmental baseline study (completed);\n• Awarding the Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Management contract for the process of the stockpile.\nOn April 29, 2023, Mexico's Senate approved a wide-ranging reform of laws governing the mining industry, including a\nrequirement that companies pay a percentage of profits to various stakeholders. The new mining law reduces the maximum\nlength of concessions from 50 to 30 years and may allow authorities to cancel concessions if no work is done on them within\ntwo years. The Company is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to assess the potential impacts on its Mexican\nassets.\nSince Osisko Development's acquisition of the San Antonio Project in November 2020, the Company has successfully\nachieved the following operational milestones:\n• The construction of a leach pad and carbon in column plant at the end of 2021 to process stockpiled mineralized\nmaterial.\n• 1.1 million tonne stockpile with an average grade of 0.58 g/t Au was placed on the heap leach pad.\n• A total of 13,591 net ounces of gold was sold from the San Antonio heap leach pad.\n• During Q3 2023, processing of the remaining stockpile inventory was completed, and the Company does not\nanticipate any production henceforth.\nPermitting\nThe Company continued the various permitting activities starting in 2020. These activities consist of obtaining the permits\nfor the MIA and the change of use of land while continuing the work required to complete the environmental baseline study.\nApplications were submitted for four new mining claims, Sapuchi E-82/40881, Sapuchi 2 E-82/40882, Sapuchi 3 E-\n82/40883, and Sapuchi 4 E-82/40888.\nAll documentation required for the change of use land and EA permits were filed and the Company was awaiting the granting\nof these two permits by the Mexican government. In early December 2022, the director of SEMARNAT announced a\nmoratorium on all environmental permits for open pit operations, which will be denied with no approval process in place until\nfurther notice. Subsequently, the Company received communication that the MIA would not be approved. The approval\nprocess for environmental permits for mining may resume after the conclusion of the governor and presidential elections\nwhich will be held in July 2024, with the new president taking office in September 2024. In order to ensure that the San\nAntonio Gold Project would not be further delayed from the granting of the permits, management withdrew both permit\napplications with the intent to refile once the moratorium is lifted or a clear approval process is in place.\nExploration Program\nA two-phase 45,000-meter drilling campaign was initiated during 2021. The objective of the drill program was to conduct\nexploration and resource drilling at a spacing of 25 meters and historic drilling validation for the three main target areas:\n18\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nSapuchi, California and Golfo de Oro. The Company anticipates exploration potential to expand both oxide and sulphide\nresources.\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company announced an initial open pit mineral resource estimate for the San Antonio Project (\"MRE\nSapuchi\"). See tables below. The 2022 MRE Sapuchi covers a portion of the Sapuchi – Cero Verde trend that encompasses\nfive deposits: Sapuchi, Golfo de Oro, California, Calvario and High Life over approximately 2.8 km along strike, a maximum\nwidth of 600 metres (m) to a maximum depth of 300 m below surface.\nThe MRE Sapuchi is based on 84,454 m of current and verified historic drilling in 579 holes, of which 27,870 m of drilling in\n177 holes were performed by the Company in 2021. Gold mineralization is hosted within altered hydrothermal breccia and\nsediments, as stockwork quartz veins and veinlets, adjacent to intrusions and fault structures and often associated with iron\ncarbonate minerals. Metallurgical testing has shown amenability of leaching in the oxide materials and recommendations\nof milling in the transition and sulphide zones. No drilling has occurred on the San Antonio Project since 2021 and there has\nnot been any ongoing exploration program in respect of the San Antonio Gold Project since then.\nFor further information regarding the San Antonio Project, please see the technical report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report\nfor the 2022 Mineral Resource Estimate on the San Antonio Project, Sonora, Mexico\", dated July 12, 2022 with an effective\ndate of June 24, 2022 on the Company’s website or under the Company’s issuer profile at www.sedarplus.ca and at\nwww.sec.gov.\nStockpile\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Sapuchi Minera commenced processing its stockpile inventory through sodium cyanide heap\nleach pads (\"heap leach pad\") and carbon-in-column processing plant. The Company realized its first gold sales in July\n2022 and generated gold sales totaling 10,478 net ounces in 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Sapuchi\nMinera sold 3,113 net ounces of gold sold. The Company does not anticipate any production henceforth.\nOn September 30, 2022, the San Antonio gold project was written down to its net estimated recoverable amount of $35.0\nmillion ($nil net of the stream financing).\n2024 Objectives\nThe San Antonio gold project continues to be in care and maintenance. The Company awaits next steps from the\ngovernment of Mexico with respect to the permitting process and the status of open pit mining in the country. In addition,\nthe Board of Directors has authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Project.\n7. SUSTAINABILITY ACTIVITIES\nThe Company views sustainability as a key part of its strategy to create value for its shareholders and other stakeholders.\nThe Company focuses on the following key areas:\n• Promoting the mining industry and its benefits to society;\n• Promoting the Company’s values through our three pillars of Sustainability; Good neighbor, Engaged workforce\nand Environmental stewardship;\n• Developing and maintaining strong relationships with First nations, stakeholders, the Federal, Provincial and\nMunicipal governments where the Company has activities and projects;\n• Supporting the economic development of regions where it operates;\n• Promoting diversity and inclusivity throughout the organization and the mining industry; and\n19\nOsisko Development Corp.

In comparison, the Company recognized\n$10.8 million and $14.3 million in revenues, respectively for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,\nfrom the sales of recovered gold and silver from its Bonanza Ledge II project, Trixie test mine operations\nand Sapuchi stockpile project. The costs of sales in relation to the gold and silver sold of $2.7 million and\n$4.7 million were also recognized in the consolidated statement of loss for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 (2023 - $11.4 million and $15.8 million, respectively).\n(b) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, other operating costs amounted to $6.9 million and\n$15.7 million (2023 - $3.5 million and $14.0 million, respectively). These costs are related to the care and\nmaintenance costs at the Cariboo Project, the Tintic test mine and the San Antonio Project.\n(c) General and administrative expenses of $6.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 (2023 -\n$10.5 million) include $2.4 million of salaries and benefits (2023 - $3.7 million), $0.2 million of share-based\ncompensation expense (2023 - $2.2 million) and $3.8 million of administrative expenses (2023 - $4.6\nmillion) such as insurance fees and legal and other consulting fees. General and administrative expenses\nof $12.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 (2023 - $20.5 million) include $3.8 million of salaries\nand benefits (2023 - $7.2 million), $0.2 million of share-based compensation expense (2023 - $4.2 million)\nand $8.4 million of administrative expenses (2023 - $9.1 million). The decreases are primarily due to a\nlower compensation expense related mainly to the reduction of employees compared to the comparative\nperiods and general decrease in activities.\n(d) For the six months ended June 30, 2024, an impairment charge of $5.4 million was recorded on certain\nindividual assets at the Trixie test mine and at the Cariboo Gold Project.\n21\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\n(e) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, other expense net of other income amounted to $14.8\nmillion and $2.0 million respectively (2023 – $(1.3) million and $0.5 million, respectively). The amount\nincludes the recognition of the accretion expense net of the change in fair value of the warrant liability and\nforeign exchange loss related to impact of variation in exchange rates.\n9.

The\nincrease in cash flows used in operating activities is mainly due to lower revenues and related level of operations at all the\nsites compared to 2023, including the related impact on items of working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities amounted to $9.6 million in Q2 2024 compared to cash flows used in investing\nactivities of $22.0 million in Q2 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in mining development activities\nimpacting the level of additions in mining interests and property, plant and equipment. In addition, additional proceeds were\nreceived from the disposal of other investments.\nFinancing Activities\nThe cash flows used in financing activities amounted to $1.6 million in Q2 2024 compared to a similar level of cash flows\nused in financing activities of $1.6 million in Q2 2023.\n22\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nSix months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nOperating Activities\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 cash flows used in operating activities amounted to $22.3 million compared to\n$24.6 million for the comparative period of 2023. The slight decrease in operating activities is mainly due to lower revenues\nand related level of operations at all the sites compared to 2023, including the related impact on items of working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities amounted to $16.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to cash\nflows used in investing activities of $45.1 million in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in mining\ndevelopment activities impacting the level of additions in mining interests and property, plant and equipment. In addition,\nadditional proceeds were received from the disposal of investments and property, plant and equipment, assets classified\nas held for sale and other investments.\nFinancing Activities\nThe cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to $27.6 million for the first six months of 2024 compared to cash\nflows provided by financing activities of $50.5 million for the same period of 2023. In 2023, the Company completed a bought\ndeal financing of $51.8 million while in 2024, the Company drawn an amount of US$25.0 million ($33.9 million) under the\nCredit Facility.\nSince the inception of the Company up to the date of this report, a total of $641 million of capital has been raised through\nbrokered and non-brokered private placement financings, stream financings, a bought deal public offering and a credit\nfacility.\n9.1. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at June 30, 2024, the Company has a negative working capital of $29.6 million, which included cash and cash equivalent\nbalance of $33.7 million. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of $548.0 million and incurred a net loss of $36.7\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The working capital as at June 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to meet the\nCompany’s obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures through June 30, 2025. Management is aware, in\nmaking its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a substantial doubt upon\nthe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and accordingly, the appropriateness of the use of accounting\nprinciples applicable to a going concern. The accompanied unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements\ndo not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, expenses and financial position classifications\nthat would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These adjustments could be material. In\nassessing whether a going concern assumption is appropriate, management considers all available information about the\nfuture, which is at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting period. In order to execute on its\nplanned activities, the Company will be required to secure additional financing in the future, which may be completed in\nseveral ways including, but not limited to, a combination of selling investments from its existing portfolio, project debt finance,\nofftake or royalty financing and other capital markets alternatives. However, there can be no assurance that the Company\nwill be able to obtain adequate financings in the future, or at terms favorable to the Company.\nSignificant variations in the liquidity and capital resources for the three months ended June 30, 2024 are explained under\nsection 9. Cash Flows. The Company is dependent upon raising funds in order to fund future capital expenditures and\ndevelopment programs. See section 13.

Cash Flows.\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents and the disposal of a portion of the equipment classified as assets held for sale\nexplain mainly the decrease in total current assets.\nThe increase in mining interests is mainly due to the detailed engineering on reclamation work, water treatment, waste\nmanagement, the expenditures related to the permit application and for the bulk sample at the Cariboo Gold Project. The\ndecrease in property, plant and equipment is mainly related to the impairment charge recorded and described in section 8.\nFinancial Performance as well as depreciation expense for the period. The increase in exploration and evaluation is largely\nrelated to the resource estimate and exploration program on the Tintic Project.\nOther investments decreased due to the overall change in fair values and partial dispositions of holdings in the Company’s\ninvestment portfolio.\nThe increase in current liabilities is mainly due to the amount drawn on the Credit Facility and the classification of the warrant\nliability as current liabilities as a consequence of the application of the Amendments to IAS 1 as described in Note 3 to the\nunaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe decrease in long-term debt is mainly due to a reclassification to short term of a debt that is maturing which is included\nin current liabilities. Similarly, the decrease in environmental rehabilitation provision is explained by the reclassification to\ncurrent liabilities in connection with the expected schedule of settlement.\n24\nOsisko Development Corp.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS\nThere are no significant off-balance sheet arrangements, other than contractual obligations and commitments mentioned\nabove.\n16. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe Company’s activities, being the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties in Canada and\nworldwide, is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Certain factors, including but not limited to the ones below,\ncould materially affect the Company’s financial condition and/or future operating results, and could cause actual events to\ndiffer materially from those described in forward-looking statements made by or related to the Company. Refer to the\n\"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" for more information. The reader should carefully consider these\nrisks as well as the information disclosed herein and, in the Company’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements and audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company’s view of risks is not static, and readers are cautioned that there can be no assurance that all risks to the\nCompany, at any point in time, can be accurately identified, assessed as to significance or impact, managed or effective\ncontrolled or mitigated. There can be additional new or elevated risks to the Company that are not described herein.\nFor a comprehensive discussion of the risk factors that may affect the Company, its business operations and financial\nperformance, refer to the risk disclosure under the heading \"Risk Factors\" contained in the Company’s annual information\nform dated March 28, 2024, for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"AIF\"), which disclosure is hereby incorporated by\nreference herein. The AIF and other publicly filed disclosure regarding the Company, which are available electronically on\nSEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development's issuer profile.\n30\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nRisks relating to Additional Financing and Dilution\nOsisko Development's development and exploration activities are subject to financing risks. At the present time, the\nCompany has exploration and development assets which may generate periodic revenues through test mining but has no\nmines in the commercial production stage that generate positive cash flows. The Company cautions that test mining at its\noperations could be suspended at any time. The Company’s ability to explore for and discover potential economic projects,\nand then to bring them into production, is highly dependent upon its ability to raise equity and debt capital in the financial\nmarkets. Any projects that the Company develops will require significant capital expenditures. To obtain such funds, the\nCompany may sell additional securities including, but not limited to, the Company’s shares or some form of convertible\nsecurity, the effect of which may result in a substantial dilution of the equity interests of the Company’s Shareholders.\nAlternatively, the Company may also sell a part of its interest in an asset in order to raise capital. There is no assurance\nthat the Company will be able to raise the funds required to continue its exploration programs and finance the development\nof any potentially economic deposit that is identified on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to obtain the necessary\nfinancing(s) could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s growth strategy, results of operations, financial condition\nand project scheduling.\nRisks related to mining operations\nMining operations are and will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration, development and\nproduction of mineral resources and mineral reserves including unusual or unexpected geological formations and other\nconditions such as formation pressures, fire, power outages, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to\nobtain suitable machinery, equipment or labour, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property, and\npossible environmental damage that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate\nor adequately mitigate. The Company may be subject to liability for pollution, cave-ins or hazards against which it cannot\ninsure or against which it may elect not to insure. The payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial position of the Company.\nMajor expenditures are required to develop metallurgical processes and to construct mining and processing facilities at a\nparticular site. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are:\nthe particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which are highly\nvolatile; and governmental regulations, including those relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, allowable\nproduction, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection.\nOperations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\nCertain operations of the Company including the test mining at Bonanza Ledge II Project and Trixie test mine, have operated\nwithout the benefit of a feasibility study including mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as\na result, there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such\nrecovery. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that\ncommercial production will commence, continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved.\nThe failure to commence or continue production would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability to generate\nrevenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse\nimpact on the Company’s cash flow and potential profitability.\nNegative Operating Cash Flow\nThe Company has negative cash flow from operations. As a result of the expected expenditures to be incurred by the\nCorporation for the development of the Company’s material projects, the Company anticipates that negative operating cash\nflows will continue until one or both of the Company’s material projects enters commercial production (if at all). There can\nbe no assurance that the Company will generate positive cash flow from operations in the future. The Company will require\nadditional capital in order to fund its future activities for its material projects. To the extent that the Company continues to\nhave negative operating cash flow in future periods, it may need to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to fund such\nnegative cash flow. Furthermore, additional financing, whether through the issue of additional equity and/or debt securities\n31\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nand/or project level debt, will be required to continue the development of the Company’s material projects and there is no\nassurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available or that these financings will be on terms at least\nas favourable to the Company as those previously obtained, or at all. Failure to obtain additional financing or to achieve\nprofitability and positive operating cash flows will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of\noperations.\nNo Earnings and History of Losses\nThe business of developing and exploring resource properties involves a high degree of risk and, therefore, there is no\nassurance that current exploration and test mining programs will result in profitable operations. The Company has not\ndetermined whether any of its properties contain economically recoverable reserves of mineralized material and currently\nhas minimal or no revenues from its projects; therefore, the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows from its\noperations. There can be no assurance that significant additional losses will not occur in the future. The Company’s\noperating expenses and capital expenditures may increase in future years with advancing exploration, development, and/or\nproduction from the Company’s properties. The Company does not anticipate receiving sufficient revenues from operations\nto offset operational expenditures in the foreseeable future and expects to incur losses until such time as one or more of its\nproperties enters into commercial production and generates sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. There is no\nassurance that any of the Company’s properties will eventually graduate to commercial operation. There is also no\nassurance that new capital will become available, and if it is not, the Company may be forced to substantially curtail or\ncease operations.\nForeign Exchange Risks\nThe Company is subject to currency risks. The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar, which is exposed to\nfluctuations against other currencies. The Company’s activities are located in Canada, Mexico and the U.S.A., and as such\nmany of its expenditures and obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos. The Company maintains its\nprincipal office in Montreal (Canada), maintains cash accounts in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos and\nhas monetary assets and liabilities in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos.\nThe Company’s assets and liquidities are significantly affected by changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar and\nCanadian/Mexican peso exchange rates. Most expenses are currently denominated in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and\nMexican pesos. Exchange rate movements can therefore have a significant impact on the Company’s costs. The\nappreciation of non-Canadian dollar currencies against the Canadian dollar can increase the costs of the Company’s\nactivities.\nRisks relating to Taxation Laws\nThe Company has operations and conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and it is subject to the taxation laws of each\nsuch jurisdiction. These taxation laws are complicated and subject to change. The Company may also be subject to review,\naudit and assessment in the ordinary course. Any such changes in taxation law or reviews and assessments could result in\nhigher taxes being payable or require payment of taxes due from previous years, which could adversely affect the\nCompany’s liquidities. Taxes may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to repatriate earnings and otherwise deploy\nits assets.\nPermits, Licences and Approvals\nThe operations of the Company require licences and permits from various governmental authorities. The Company believes\nit holds or is in the process of obtaining all necessary licences and permits to carry on the activities which it is currently\nconducting under applicable laws and regulations. Such licences and permits are subject to changes in regulations and in\nvarious operating circumstances. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary licences\nand permits that may be required to maintain its mining activities, construct mines or milling facilities and commence\noperations of any of its exploration properties. In addition, if the Company proceeds to production on any exploration\nproperty, it must obtain and comply with permits and licences which may contain specific conditions concerning operating\n32\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nprocedures, water use, the discharge of various materials into or on land, air or water, waste disposal, spills, environmental\nstudies, abandonment and restoration plans and financial assurances. There can be no assurance that the Company will\nbe able to obtain such permits and licences or that it will be able to comply with any such conditions.\nMineral resource and mineral reserve estimates have inherent uncertainty\nMineral resource and mineral reserve figures are only estimates. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on\nknowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results and industry practices. While the Company believes that the\nmineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, as applicable, in respect of properties in which the Company holds a direct\ninterest reflect best estimates, the estimating of mineral resources and mineral reserves is a subjective process and the\naccuracy of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, the\naccuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting available engineering\nand geological information. There is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource and mineral reserve estimate and the\nactual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from estimates. Estimated mineral\nresources and mineral reserves may have to be re-estimated based on changes in prices of gold or other minerals, further\nexploration or development activity or actual production experience. This could materially and adversely affect estimates of\nthe volume or grade of mineralization, estimated recovery rates or other important factors that influence such estimates. In\naddition, mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resource estimate will\nultimately be reclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not\nhave demonstrated economic viability.\nEconomics of developing mineral properties\nMineral exploration and development is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. While the discovery of an ore body\nmay result in substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are commercially mineable and ultimately developed\ninto producing mines. There is no assurance that any exploration properties will be commercially mineable.\nShould any mineral resources exist, substantial expenditures will be required to confirm mineral reserves which are sufficient\nto commercially mine and to obtain the required environmental approvals and permitting required to commence commercial\noperations. The decision as to whether a property contains a commercially viable mineral deposit and should be brought\ninto production will depend upon the results of exploration programs, preliminary economic assessment and/or feasibility\nstudies, and the recommendations of duly qualified engineers and/or geologists, all of which involves significant expense.\nThis decision will involve consideration and evaluation of several significant factors including, but not limited to: (a) costs of\nbringing a property into production, including exploration and development work, preparation of, if applicable, preliminary\neconomic assessment and production feasibility studies and construction of production facilities; (b) availability and costs\nof financing; (c) ongoing costs of production; (d) metal prices; (e) environmental compliance regulations and restraints\n(including potential environmental liabilities associated with historical exploration activities); and (f) political climate and/or\ngovernmental regulation and control. Development projects are also subject to the successful completion of engineering\nstudies, issuance of necessary governmental permits, and availability of adequate financing. Development projects have\nno operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow.\nUninsured Risks and Hazards\nMining is capital intensive and subject to a number of risks and hazards, including environmental pollution, accidents or\nspills, industrial and transportation accidents, labour disputes, changes in the regulatory environment, natural phenomena\n(such as inclement weather conditions, earthquakes, pit wall failures and cave-ins) and encountering unusual or unexpected\ngeological conditions. Such risk and hazards might impact the Company’s business. Consequently, many of the foregoing\nrisks and hazards could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company’s mineral properties or future processing\nfacilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in or interruption of or cessation of their exploration or\ndevelopment activities, delay in or inability to receive required regulatory approvals, or costs, monetary losses and potential\nlegal liability and adverse governmental action. Osisko Development may be subject to liability or sustain loss for certain\nrisks and hazards against which it does not or cannot insure or against which it may reasonably elect not to insure because\nof the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could result in material economic harm to the Company.\n33\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\nFluctuation in market value of Osisko Development Common Shares\nThe market price of Osisko Development Common Shares is affected by many variables not directly related to the corporate\nperformance of the Company, including the strength of the economy generally, the availability and attractiveness of\nalternative investments, and the breadth of the public market for the stock. The effect of these and other factors on the\nmarket price of the Osisko Development Shares in the future cannot be predicted and may cause decreases in asset values,\nwhich may result in impairment losses.\n17. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (ICFR)\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be\ndisclosed in reports files with the securities regulatory authorities are recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a\ntimely fashion. The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by\nthe Company in such reports is then accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management to ensure timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Management regularly reviews disclosure controls and procedures; however, they\ncannot provide an absolute level of assurance because of the inherent limitations in control systems to prevent or detect all\nmisstatements due to error or fraud. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, along with Management, have\nevaluated and concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and appropriately designed\nas at June 30, 2024.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls\nover financial reporting. The Company’s internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with IFRS. Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management\nevaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. In making the\nassessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, the Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, together with Management, have evaluated whether there were changes to the ICFR\nduring the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, the Company’s ICFR. No such changes were identified through their evaluation. The Company’s management,\nincluding the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that internal controls over financial reporting and\ndisclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even\nthose systems determined to be properly designed and effective can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives\nof the control system are met.\nLimitations of Controls and Procedures\nManagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and\nprocedures or internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system\nmust reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the reality judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or\nmistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more\npeople, or by unauthorized override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving\nits stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective\ncontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n34\nOsisko Development Corp. Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\n18. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS\nPlease refer to the basis of presentation and statement of compliance in Note 2 of the Company’s unaudited condensed\ninterim consolidated financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2024.\n19. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\nEstimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including\nexpectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The determination of estimates\nrequires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience and current\nand expected economic conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions as well as critical judgments in applying the Company’s accounting policies\nare detailed in the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAll financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. The fair value is based on quoted\nmarket prices, unless the financial instruments are not traded in an active market. In this case, the fair value is determined\nby using valuation techniques like discounted cash flows, the Black-Scholes option pricing model or other valuation\ntechniques. Measurement in subsequent periods depends on the classification of the financial instrument. A description of\nfinancial instruments and their fair value is included in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nManagement of Financial Risk\nCurrency Risk\nThe Company is exposed to financial risk due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company operates in the United\nStates and Canada, and a portion of its expenses are incurred in Canadian dollars. A significant change in the exchange\nrates between the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar could have an effect on the Company’s results of operations,\nfinancial position and cash flows. The Company has not hedged its exposure to currency fluctuations.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual\nobligations. The maximum credit risk the Company is exposed to is 100% of cash and cash equivalents and receivables.\nThe Company’s cash is held in large Canadian and U.S. financial institutions. The Company does not deem that it has\nsignificant credit risk exposure.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company\nhas a planning and budgeting process in place to help determine the funds required to support the Company’s normal\noperating requirements on an ongoing basis. The Company ensures that there are sufficient funds to meet its short-term\nbusiness requirements by taking into account anticipated cash expenditures for its exploration and operational activities.\nThe Company will pursue additional equity, stream or debt financing as required to meet its long-term commitments. There\nis no assurance that such financing will be available or that it will be available on favorable terms.\n35\nOsisko Development Corp.

Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nThis MD&A contains certain non-IFRS (as defined herein) measures including, \"all-in sustaining cost\" (or \"AISC\") and \"cash\ncost\". All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce is defined as production costs less silver sales plus general and administrative,\nexploration, other expenses and sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces. Cash costs are a non-IFRS\nmeasure reported by the Company on an ounces of gold sold basis. Cash costs include mining, processing, refining, general\nand administration costs and royalties but exclude depreciation, reclamation, income taxes, capital and exploration costs\nfor the life of the mine. Management believes that such measures provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the\nperformance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and,\ntherefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide\nadditional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in\naccordance with IFRS, such as Cost of sales.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the statements of historical fact contained herein, the information presented in this MD&A constitutes \"forward-\nlooking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian Securities Laws concerning the business, operations, plans\nand financial performance and condition of the Company (collectively, the \"Forward-Looking Information\").

As such, the information contained in this MD&A concerning mineral\nproperties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources is not comparable to similar information\nmade public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission.\n1. OUR BUSINESS\nOsisko Development is a Canadian-based exploration and development company focused on past-producing properties\nlocated in mining friendly jurisdictions with district scale potential. The Company’s objective is to become a continental North\nAmerican intermediate producer of precious metals, through curating and advancing a portfolio of development projects\nand investments with potential for value creation. The principal mining assets wholly owned through subsidiaries of the\nCompany as of September 30, 2024, are as follows:\n• Cariboo Gold Project (Permitting – British Columbia, Canada) (the \"Cariboo Gold Project\"), owned and operated\nby Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd. (\"Barkerville\").\n• Tintic Project (including, the Trixie test mine located within the Company’s wider Tintic Project) (Test mining and\nexploration – Utah, United States) (the \"Tintic Project\"), owned and operated by Tintic Consolidated Metals LLC\n(\"Tintic\").\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Project, which includes\nexploring the potential for a financial or strategic partner in the asset or for a full or partial sale of the asset. The Company\nhas engaged a financial advisor in connection with the strategic review.\nAs an exploration and development stage corporation, the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows to advance the\nevaluation and development of its various projects and properties and has historically relied on equity and debt funding to\nmaintain financial liquidity. Continued adequate financial liquidity is dependent on management's ability to secure additional\n4\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nfinancings in the future; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financings\nin the future, or at terms favourable to the Company (refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\").\nThe accompanied unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of\naccounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities\nin the normal course of business as they come due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate,\nManagement takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve months\nfrom the end of the reporting period. The working capital position as at September 30, 2024, will not be sufficient to meet\nthe Company’s obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures up to the period ending September 30, 2025.\nManagement is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a\nsubstantial doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and accordingly, the appropriateness of the\nuse of accounting principles applicable to a going concern.\n2.

HIGHLIGHTS – Q3 2024\nThe following summarizes Osisko Development's financial and operational highlights in Q3 2024:\nSustainability and Permitting\nThere are no environmental issues to report in Q3 2024.\nOperations and financial\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n• In Q3 2024, the Company generated revenues of $0.2 million and incurred an operating loss of $15.6 million\ncompared to $10.4 million and $16.5 million respectively, for Q3 2023. The decrease in revenues in Q3 2024\ncompared to Q3 2023 is mainly attributable to the reduction of sales from the Tintic Project and the San Antonio\nProject as both projects were in care and maintenance during Q3 2024. The lower operating loss in Q3 2024\ncompared to Q3 2023 is primarily due to the decrease in the general level of activities at those two projects.\n5\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\n• In Q3 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $33.9 million compared to a net loss of $7.1 million in Q3 2023.\nThe increase in net loss is primarily due to a higher foreign exchange loss and a decrease in the fair value of the\nwarrant liability in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023, offset by the reasons noted above.\n• The net cash flows used in operating activities in Q3 2024 amounted to $12.3 million compared to $9.1 million in\nQ3 2023. The increase in cash flows used in operating activities is primarily due to the decrease in revenues and\nthe related impact on each project’s respective working capital and partially offset by the reduction in the general\noperating activities at the Tintic Project and the San Antonio Project.\n• Additions to mining interests, property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation expenses for Q3 2024\namounted to $10.8 million compared to $11.7 million in Q3 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in\nmining development activities, mainly related to the decrease in exploration spending at the Tintic Project.\n• Net cash inflows in financing activities amounted to $31.9 million in Q3 2024 compared to cash outflows amounting\nto $1.7 million in Q3 2023. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023\nis explained by a second drawdown in September 2024 of US$25.0 million ($33.8 million) under the Credit Facility,\nnet of fees.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n• During the first nine months of 2024, the Company generated revenue of $4.6 million and incurred an operating\nloss of $49.5 million compared to $24.7 million and $53.6 million respectively, in the first nine months of 2023. The\ndecrease in revenue is mainly attributable to the decrease of revenue from all projects as they were in care and\nmaintenance during the first nine months of 2024. The lower operating loss is primarily due to the decrease in the\noverall level of activities and by an impairment of assets of $5.4 million.\n• During the first nine months of 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $70.5 million compared to a net loss of\n$43.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in operating loss in 2024, due to the reasons noted\nabove, was offset by an increase in finance costs related to credit agreement as described below, entered in 2024\nand a foreign exchange loss recorded in 2024 compared to a gain in the corresponding period in 2023.\n• The net cash flows used in operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 amounted to $34.6 million compared\nto $33.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase is primarily due to the impact on working capital from\nthe reduction in activities at the Tintic Project and the San Antonio Project.\n• Additions to mining interests, property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation expenses in the first\nnine months of 2024 amounted to $32.9 million compared to $57.5 million in 2023. The decrease is primarily due\nto a reduction in mining development activities, including a decrease in exploration spending at the Cariboo Gold\nProject and at the Tintic Project.\n• Net cash inflows from financing activities amounted to $59.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to\nnet cash inflows of $48.8 million in 2023. In 2023, the Company completed a bought deal financing of $51.8 million\nand in 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement as described below.\nExploration Activities\n• On August 7, 2024, the Company provided an update on exploration activities at the Tintic Project, including the\nresults of recently completed surface and underground diamond drilling targeting potential copper-gold-\nmolybdenum porphyry centers, underground chip sampling at Trixie, and ongoing target generation work.

See\n\"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\".\n6.1. Cariboo Gold Project – British Columbia, Canada\nThe Cariboo Gold Project is an advanced stage gold exploration project 100%-owned by the Company located in the historic\nWells-Barkerville mining camp, in the District of Wells, central British Columbia, Canada, that extends for approximately 77\nkilometres from northwest to southeast. The Company’s total land package consists of 443 mineral titles and covers an\narea of approximately 185,640 hectares. On November 21, 2019, Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (\"OGR\") acquired the Cariboo\nGold Project through the acquisition of Barkerville. The project was part of the OGR contributed assets that created the\nCompany on November 25, 2020.\nTechnical reports and mineral resource estimate\nThe Company completed a Feasibility Study (\"FS\") for the Cariboo Gold Project with an effective date of January 12, 2023.\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this MD&A relating to the Cariboo Gold Project is supported by the\ntechnical report filed in respect of the FS on the Cariboo Gold Project titled \"Feasibility Study for the Cariboo Gold Project,\nDistrict of Well, British Columbia, Canada\", dated January 10, 2023 (as amended January 12, 2023) with an effective date\nof December 30, 2022 (the \"Cariboo FS\"), which was prepared for the Company by Colin Hardie, P.

Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have\ndemonstrated economic viability.\n2. The Mineral Resource Estimate conforms to the 2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves\nand follows the 2019 CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines.\n3. A total of 481 vein zones were modelled for the Cow Mountain (Cow and Valley), Island Mountain (Shaft and Mosquito),\nBarkerville Mountain (BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee) deposits and one gold zone for Bonanza Ledge. A minimum true\nthickness of 2.0 m was applied, using the Au gold grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when\nnot assayed.\n4. The estimate is reported for a potential underground scenario at a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au, except for Bonanza Ledge\nat a cut- off grade of 3.5 g/t Au. The cut-off grade for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee deposits\nwas calculated using a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $54.32/t;\na processing and transport cost of $22.29/t;a G&A plus Environmental cost of $15.31/t; and a sustaining CAPEX cost of\n$31.19/t. The cut-off grade for the Bonanza Ledge deposit was calculated using a gold price of US$1,700/oz; a USD:CAD\nexchange rate of 1.27; a global mining cost of $79.13/t; a processing and transport cost of $65.00/t; and a G&A plus\nEnvironmental cost of $51.65/t. The cut-off grades should be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing market conditions\n(metal prices, exchange rate, mining cost, etc.).\n5. Bulk density varies from 2.69 g/ cm3 to 3.20 g/ cm3.\n6. A four-step capping procedure was applied to composited data. Restricted search ellipsoids ranged from 7 to 50 g/t Au\nat four different distances ranging from 25 m to 250 m. High-grades at Bonanza Ledge were capped at 70 g/t Au on 2.0\nm composited data.\n7. The gold Mineral Resources for the Cow, Valley, Shaft, Mosquito, BC Vein, KL, and Lowhee vein zones were estimated\nusing Datamine StudioTM RM 1.9 software using hard boundaries on composited assays. The silver Mineral Resources\nand the dilution halo gold mineralization were estimated using Datamine StudioTM RM Pro 1.11. The OK method was\nused. Mineral Resources for Bonanza Ledge were estimated using GEOVIA GEMSTM 6.7 software using hard\nboundaries on composited assays. The OK method was used to interpolate a block model.\n11\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\n8. Results are presented in situ. Calculations used metric units (meters, tonnes, g/t). Any discrepancies in the totals are\ndue to rounding effects.\nMineral Reserves Estimate\nProbable Mineral Reserves of 16.7 Mt grading 3.78 g/t Au for 2.03 Moz of contained gold in underground deposits, as\ndefined below, have an effective date of December 6, 2022 and form the basis of the Cariboo FS. Only Mineral Resources\nthat were classified as Measured and Indicated were given economic attributes in the mine design and when demonstrating\neconomic viability were classified as Mineral Reserves, incorporating an external mining dilution factor of 8% into the Mineral\nReserves estimate.\nTable 6: Cariboo Mineral Reserves Statement – December 6, 2022\nTonnes G old Grade Contained Gold Silver Grade Contained\nClassification / Deposit (000's) (g/t) (000's oz) (g/t) Silver (oz)\nProven — — — — —\nProbable\nCow 4,127 3.41 453 0.08 11,018\nValley 3,445 3.70 410 0.14 15,059\nShaft 7,962 3.87 990 0.02 4,473\nMosquito 603 4.93 95 0.03 619\nLowhee 567 4.56 83 0.21 3,786\nTotal Proven and Probable Reserves 16,703 3.78 2,031 0.07 34,955\nNotes:\n1. Totals may not add up due to rounding.\n2. Mineral Reserves have been estimated in accordance with CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral\nReserves (2014), which are incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.\n3. Mineral Reserves used the following assumptions: US$1,700/oz gold price, USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.27, and\nvariable cut- off value from 1.70 g/t to 4.00 g/t Au\n4. Mineral Reserves include both internal and external dilution along with mining recovery. The external dilution is\nestimated to be 8%. The average mining recovery factor was set at 93.6% to account for ore left in each block in the\nmargins of the deposit.\nThe mineral resource estimate is built upon over 650,000 meters of core from the 2015 to 2021 drill campaigns, and\nhistorically verified drill data using a total of 4,064 drill holes. A strong understanding of the controls of mineralization enabled\nOsisko Development's technical team to construct a mineral resource estimate constrained by lithology, alteration, structure\nand mineralization.\nOn December 31, 2022, the Cariboo gold project was written down to its net estimated recoverable amount of $435.7 million\nwhich was determined by the value-in-use using a discounted cash-flow approach and reflected as an impairment of Mining\nInterests. The main valuation inputs used were the cash flows expected to be generated by the production and sale of gold\nfrom the Cariboo gold project over the estimated life of the mine, based on the expected long-term gold price per ounce\ncosts inflation forecast and the discount rate of 12.6% applied to the cash flow projections.\nPermitting and EA Process\nOsisko Development started the EA Process in the spring of 2019 for the Cariboo Gold Project.\nOn October 27, 2021, the Province of British Columbia, Lhtako Dené First Nation and the Company announced the approval\nof amendments to Mines Act Permits M-238 and M-198 allowing for the expansion of the existing Bonanza Ledge II\nunderground mine. At the time, these amendments supported the employment of additional workers at the mine. The\nexpansion of the Bonanza Ledge II Project allowed for continuity of certain mining activities while the Cariboo Gold Project\n12\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nenvironmental assessment was underway. In July 2021, the province of British Columbia authorized a permit to extract a\nbulk sample of 10,000 tonnes of mineralized material, the development of a portal and 2,200 m of drift to access the mineral\ndeposit.\nOn October 10, 2023, the Company announced that it received an Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") Certificate for the\nCompany’s 100%-owned Cariboo Gold Project. The EA Certificate was granted by the Environmental Assessment Office\nof the Province of British Columbia (\"EAO\") and is supported by approval decisions from The Honourable George Heyman,\nMinister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy and The Honourable Josie Osbourne, Minister of Energy, Mines and\nLow Carbon Innovation. Receipt of the EA Certificate successfully concludes the EA process for the Cariboo Gold Project\nlaunched in October 2019, and completed in consultation with and support of the First Nations partners. On November 7,\n2024, the Company announced that while it had yet to reach an agreement with the Xatśūll First Nation, it would continue\nto engage and consult with Xatśūll First Nation including after decision on the granting of the permits.\nOn May 31, 2023, the Company submitted its Joint Permit Application (\"JPA\") and passed the screening phase of the permit\nin September 2023 after submitting the final, revised application. Through 4 rounds of review from the Mine Review\nCommittee, the Company responded to, addressed, and closed over 1,800 comments from various stakeholders.\nThe BC Mines Act permit has been referred for decision to the statutory decision maker in the BC Ministry of Energy, Mines\nand Low Carbon Innovation. The review of the Environmental Management Act permits has been completed, as well, and\nthe Company is awaiting referral thereof to the statutory decision maker in the immediate future. The Company anticipates\nreceiving final decisions in Q4 2024.\nCariboo Gold Project – Permitting Timeline Summary\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Cariboo Gold Project is in advanced stages of permitting and the history of the process is\nsummarized in the following highlights:\n• Signing Ceremony on October 23, 2022 with Lhtako Dené First Nation's Elders and Members in Wells and Quesnel\nwas an important event for the life of project agreement between Lhtako Dene First Nation and Osisko Development\nhighlighting the importance of our partnership and mutual support and benefits.\n13\nOsisko Development Corp.

Mineral resources are reported when they are within potentially mineable shapes derived from a stope optimizer\nalgorithm, assuming an underground longhole stoping mining method with stopes of 6.1 m x 6.1 m x minimum 1.5 m\ndimensions.\n5. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n6. Geologic modelling was completed by Osisko Development modeling geologist Jody Laing, P.Geo, using Leapfrog Geo\nsoftware. The 2024 Trixie MRE was completed by Osisko Development chief resource geologist, Daniel Downton, P.Geo\nusing Datamine Studio RM 2.0 software. William Lewis and Alan J. San Martin of Micon International Limited\nindependently reviewed and validated the mineral resource model.\n7. The estimate is reported for an underground mining scenario and with USD assumptions. The cut-off grade of 4.32 g/t\nAu was calculated using a gold price of US$1,750/oz, a CAD: USD exchange rate of 1.3; total mining, processing and\nG&A costs of US$168.04/imperial ton; a refining cost of US$2.65/ounce; a combined royalty of 4.50%; and an average\nmetallurgical gold recovery of 80%.\n8. The stope optimizer algorithm evaluated the resources based on a gold equivalent grade which incorporates the silver\ngrade estimate and assumes a silver price of US$23/oz and metallurgical silver recovery of 45%.\n9. Average bulk density values in the mineralized domains were assigned to the T2 (2.955 T/m3), T3 (2.638 T/m3), T4\n(2.618 T/m3), Wild Cat, and 40 Fault (2.621 T/m3), and 75-85 (2.617 T/m3) domains.\n10. Inverse Distance Squared interpolation method was used with a parent block size of 1.2 m x 2.4 m x 2.4 m.\n11. The 2024 Trixie MRE results are presented in-situ. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes, g/t). The number of\ntonnes is rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.\n12. Neither the Company nor Micon International Limited’s qualified persons are aware of any known environmental,\npermitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the\nmineral resource estimate other than disclosed in the 2024 Trixie MRE.\nDevelopments in 2024 Objectives\nIn 2024, the Company completed surface exploration drilling for porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum at the Big Hill target. A\ntotal of 9,581 feet (2,920 meters) between two drill holes were drilled at Big Hill, which completed the initial proposed drill\nplan for Big Hill. The first drill hole was completed to a depth of 1,297 meters (4,257 feet) when it transitioned out of the\nprospective alteration zone. The second drill hole was repositioned at a modified angle and completed to a depth of 1,623\nm (5,324 ft). At Trixie, a drill hole was completed to a depth of 759.6 meters (2,492 ft) when it crossed the Eureka Lily Fault\nto the east and out of the prospective alteration zone.\nAs part of a Phase II regional drilling program, the Company intends to proceed with two drill holes on the Big Hill West and\nZuma porphyry targets in the coming months.\nData compilation from historic mines in the area is ongoing and anticipated to generate additional drill targets on the greater\nTintic Project property.\nThe development of an underground ramp, which commenced in July 2022, was completed to the 625 level in Q3 2023 with\nthe breakthrough occurring at the end of September. The Company anticipates that the decline ramp will improve\nunderground access for exploration and may potentially support an increase in productivity and mining rates in the future.\nThe ability to achieve any increase in production and the capital required to increase production are the subject of pending\ntechnical work. There can be no assurance that technical work will provide justification for further development, support the\nability to increase production or demonstrate the ability to increase production through a low-capital expenditure expansion\nof the existing facilities. The ability to recommence and expand operations is subject to risks which include the possible\nneed for additional or amended permits, licenses and approvals, risks related to mining operations, the need for additional\ncapital and/or operating expenditures, commodity prices justifying such work, potential scarcity of employees, environmental\nrisks and approvals and the limited knowledge of the mineralized material available on site.\n17\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nThe Company cautions that its prior decision to commence small-scale underground mining activities and batch vat leaching\nat the Trixie test mine was made without the benefit of a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves,\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any\nparticular level of recovery of material or the cost of such recovery. The Company cautions that historically, such projects\nhave a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December\n2022, resumed in the second quarter of 2023 and, suspended again in December 2023. If and when small-scale test-mining\nat Trixie re-commences, there is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated\nproduction costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s\nability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs may have\na material adverse impact on the Company’s cash flow and potential profitability. The Company cautions that historically,\nsuch projects have a much higher economic or technical risks. In continuing current operations at Trixie, the Company has\nnot based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves\ndemonstrating economic and technical viability.\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company announced the 2024 Trixie MRE. Compared to the previous 2023 Trixie MRE, contained\ngold ounces in measured and indicated resources decreased by 29% and inferred resources decreased by 79% primarily\ndue to lower estimated grades that incorporated an updated geologic model interpretation and conversion of inferred\nresources. Drill results and underground mapping from the 2023 exploration program improved the knowledge of the extent\nand distribution of mineralization, resulting in modeling improvements to both mineralization and the historical mine shape\nmodel. A technical report in respect of the 2024 Trixie MRE titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate\nfor the Trixie Deposit, Tintic Project, Utah, United States of America\" and dated April 25, 2024 (with an effective date of\nMarch 14, 2024) was subsequently filed on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under the\nCompany’s issuer profile on April 26, 2024.\nThe test mining operations at Trixie were suspended in December 2023 and are expected to remain in care and\nmaintenance for the foreseeable future. As such, on December 31, 2023, an impairment charge of $160.5 million on the\nTrixie test mine was recorded and the net assets of the Trixie test mine were written down to their net estimated recoverable\namount (including mining interest and property, plant and equipment). Management continues to review its options for next\nsteps at the Tintic Project.\nPlease see the caution section \"Risk Factors: Operations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\".\n6.4. San Antonio Gold Project – Sonora State, Mexico\nIn addition to the Cariboo Gold Project and Tintic Project, the Company also owns the San Antonio Gold Project. The San\nAntonio Gold Project is not considered a material property of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and the date of this\nMD&A, and has been under care and maintenance since Q3 2023. No drilling has occurred on the San Antonio Project\nsince 2021 and there has not been any ongoing exploration program in respect of the San Antonio Gold Project since then.\nThe San Antonio Gold Project is a past-producing oxide copper mine. In 2020, following the acquisition of this project, the\nCompany concentrated its efforts in obtaining the required permits and amendments to the permits to perform its activities.\nThe Company has filed preventive reports for the processing of the gold stockpile on site and for a drilling program for the\nSapuchi, Golfo de Oro and California zones.\nThe Company also initiated the following activities:\n• Commencement of the Environmental Impact Manifest (or Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental (\"MIA\"));\n• An environmental baseline study (completed);\n• Awarding the Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Management contract for the process of the stockpile.\n18\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nOn April 29, 2023, Mexico's Senate approved a wide-ranging reform of laws governing the mining industry, including a\nrequirement that companies pay a percentage of profits to various stakeholders. The new mining law reduces the maximum\nlength of concessions from 50 to 30 years and may allow authorities to cancel concessions if no work is done on them within\ntwo years. The Company is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to assess the potential impacts on its Mexican\nassets.\nSince Osisko Development's acquisition of the San Antonio Project in November 2020, the Company has successfully\nachieved the following operational milestones:\n• The construction of a leach pad and carbon in column plant at the end of 2021 to process stockpiled mineralized\nmaterial.\n• 1.1 million tonne stockpile with an average grade of 0.58 g/t Au was placed on the heap leach pad.\n• A total of 13,591 net ounces of gold was sold from the San Antonio heap leach pad.\n• Processing of the stockpile inventory was completed in Q3 2023.\nPermitting\nThe Company continued the various permitting activities starting in 2020. These activities consist of obtaining the permits\nfor the MIA and the change of use of land while continuing the work required to complete the environmental baseline study.\nApplications were submitted for four new mining claims, Sapuchi E-82/40881, Sapuchi 2 E-82/40882, Sapuchi 3 E-\n82/40883, and Sapuchi 4 E-82/40888.\nAll documentation required for the change of use land and EA permits were filed and the Company was awaiting the granting\nof these two permits by the Mexican government. In early December 2022, the director of SEMARNAT announced a\nmoratorium on all environmental permits for open pit operations, which will be denied with no approval process in place until\nfurther notice. Subsequently, the Company received communication that the MIA would not be approved. Management\nwithdrew both permit applications with the intent to refile once the moratorium is lifted or a clear approval process is in place.\nThe approval process for environmental permits for mining may resume after the conclusion of the governor and presidential\nelections which were held in July 2024. The newly elected president of Mexico has taken office as of October 1, 2024.\nExploration Program\nA two-phase 45,000-meter drilling campaign was initiated during 2021. The objective of the drill program was to conduct\nexploration and resource drilling at a spacing of 25 meters and historic drilling validation for the three main target areas:\nSapuchi, California and Golfo de Oro. The Company anticipates exploration potential to expand both oxide and sulphide\nresources.\nOn September 30, 2022, the Company announced an initial open pit mineral resource estimate for the San Antonio Project\n(\"MRE Sapuchi\"). See tables below. The 2022 MRE Sapuchi covers a portion of the Sapuchi – Cero Verde trend that\nencompasses five deposits: Sapuchi, Golfo de Oro, California, Calvario and High Life over approximately 2.8 km along\nstrike, a maximum width of 600 metres (m) to a maximum depth of 300 m below surface.\nThe MRE Sapuchi is based on 84,454 m of current and verified historic drilling in 579 holes, of which 27,870 m of drilling in\n177 holes were performed by the Company in 2021. Gold mineralization is hosted within altered hydrothermal breccia and\nsediments, as stockwork quartz veins and veinlets, adjacent to intrusions and fault structures and often associated with iron\ncarbonate minerals. Metallurgical testing has shown amenability of leaching in the oxide materials and recommendations\nof milling in the transition and sulphide zones. No drilling has occurred on the San Antonio Project since 2021 and there has\nnot been any ongoing exploration program in respect of the San Antonio Gold Project since then.\n19\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nFor further information regarding the San Antonio Project, please see the technical report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report\nfor the 2022 Mineral Resource Estimate on the San Antonio Project, Sonora, Mexico\", dated July 12, 2022 with an effective\ndate of June 24, 2022 on the Company's website or under the Company's issuer profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca)\nand on EDGAR (www.sec.gov).\nStockpile\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Sapuchi Minera commenced processing its stockpile inventory through sodium cyanide heap\nleach pads (\"heap leach pad\") and carbon-in-column processing plant. The Company realized its first gold sales in July\n2022 and generated gold sales totaling 10,478 net ounces in 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Sapuchi\nMinera sold 3,113 net ounces of gold sold. Processing of the stockpile inventory was completed in Q3 2023.\nOn September 30, 2022, the San Antonio gold project was written down to its net estimated recoverable amount of $35.0\nmillion ($nil net of the stream financing). The net book value of the project as at September 30, 2024 remains $nil.\nStatus\nThe San Antonio gold project continues to be in care and maintenance. The Company awaits next steps from the\ngovernment of Mexico with respect to the permitting process and the status of open pit mining in the country. In addition,\nthe Board of Directors has authorized a strategic review of the San Antonio Project.\n7. SUSTAINABILITY ACTIVITIES\nThe Company views sustainability as a key part of its strategy to create value for its shareholders and other stakeholders.\nThe Company focuses on the following key areas:\n• Promoting the mining industry and its benefits to society;\n• Promoting the Company’s values through our three pillars of Sustainability; Good neighbor, Engaged workforce\nand Environmental stewardship;\n• Developing and maintaining strong relationships with First nations, stakeholders, the Federal, Provincial and\nMunicipal governments where the Company has activities and projects;\n• Supporting the economic development of regions where it operates;\n• Promoting diversity and inclusivity throughout the organization and the mining industry; and\n• Encouraging investee companies and our contractors to adhere to the same areas of focus in sustainability.\nThe following are a few highlights from each of the projects:\nBarkerville\n• Positive relationship with Lhtako Dené Nation since 2015.

In comparison, the Company\nrecognized $10.4 million and $24.7 million in revenues, respectively for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, from the sales of recovered gold and silver from its Bonanza Ledge II project, Trixie\ntest mine operations and Sapuchi stockpile project. The costs of sales in relation to the gold and silver sold\nof $0.1 million and $4.8 million were also recognized in the consolidated statement of loss for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 (2023 - $10.1 million and $25.9 million, respectively).\n(b) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other operating costs amounted to $7.7 million\nand $23.3 million (2023 - $6.8million and $20.8 million, respectively). These costs are related to the care\nand maintenance costs at the Cariboo Project, the Tintic test mine and the San Antonio Project.\n(c) General and administrative expenses of $7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (2023\n– $9.4 million) include $2.2 million of salaries and benefits (2023 – $3.7 million), $1.5 million of share-based\ncompensation expense (2023 – $2.0 million) and $4.2 million of administrative expenses (2023 – $3.7\nmillion) such as insurance fees and legal and other consulting fees. General and administrative expenses\nof $20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (2023 – $30.0 million) include $6.0 million\nof salaries and benefits (2023 – $11.0 million), $1.7 million of share-based compensation expense (2023 –\n$6.1 million) and $12.6 million of administrative expenses (2023 – $12.9 million). The decreases are\nprimarily due to a lower employee compensation expense related mainly to the reduction of the workforce\ncompared to the comparative periods and general decrease in activities.\n(d) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an impairment charge of $5.4 million was recorded on\ncertain individual assets at the Trixie test mine and at the Cariboo Gold Project.\n(e) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expense net of other income amounted\nto $17.7 million and $19.7 million respectively (2023 – other income, net of other expense of $9.8 million\nand $9.3 million, respectively).

The\nincrease in cash flows used in operating activities is mainly due to lower revenues and related level of operations at all the\nsites compared to 2023, including the related impact on items of working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities amounted to $12.3 million in Q3 2024 compared to cash flows used in investing\nactivities of $4.5 million in Q3 2023. In Q3 2023, the Company received proceeds from disposal of investments and\nreclamation deposits compared to an increase in reclamation deposits in Q3 2024. Additions to mining interests, property,\nplant and equipment and exploration and evaluation expenses for Q3 2024 amounted to $10.8 million compared to $11.7\nmillion in Q3 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in mining development activities, mainly related to the\ndecrease in exploration spending at the Tintic Project.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash inflows in financing activities amounted to $31.9 million in Q3 2024 compared to cash outflow amounted of $1.7\nmillion in Q3 2023. In Q3 2024, an amount of US$25.0 million ($33.8 million) was drawn under the Credit Facility, net of\nUS$0.7 million ($1.1 million) of fees. As at September 30, 2024, the Credit Facility is fully drawn.\n23\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOperating Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 cash flows used in operating activities amounted to $34.6 million compared\nto $33.6 million for the comparative period of 2023. The increase in net cash flows used in operating activities is mainly due\nto lower revenues and related level of operations at all the sites compared to 2023, including the related impact on items of\nworking capital.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities amounted to $28.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto cash flows used in investing activities of $49.6 million in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in mining\ndevelopment activities impacting the level of additions in mining interests and property, plant and equipment. In addition,\nadditional proceeds were received from the disposal of investments and property, plant and equipment, assets classified\nas held for sale and other investments compared to in the first nine months of 2023.\nFinancing Activities\nThe cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to $59.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to cash\nflows provided by financing activities of $48.8 million for the same period of 2023. In 2023, the Company completed a bought\ndeal financing of $51.8 million while in 2024, the Company drawn an amount of US$50.0 million ($67.7 million) under the\nCredit Facility.\nSince the inception of the Company up to the date of this MD&A, a total of $745.4 million of capital has been raised through\nbrokered and non-brokered private placement financings, stream financings, a bought deal public offering and a credit\nfacility.\n9.1. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company has a negative working capital of $64.7 million, which included cash and cash\nequivalent balance of $40.8 million. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of $581.8 million and incurred a net loss\nof $70.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The working capital as at September 30, 2024 will not be\nsufficient to meet the Company’s obligations, commitments and forecasted expenditures through September 30, 2025.\nManagement is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events and conditions that may cast a\nsubstantial doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and accordingly, the appropriateness of the\nuse of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. The accompanied unaudited condensed interim consolidated\nfinancial statements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, expenses and financial\nposition classifications that would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These adjustments\ncould be material. In assessing whether a going concern assumption is appropriate, management considers all available\ninformation about the future, which is at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting period. In order\nto execute on its planned activities, the Company will be required to secure additional financing in the future, which may be\ncompleted in several ways including, but not limited to, a combination of selling investments from its existing portfolio, project\ndebt finance, offtake or royalty financing and other capital markets alternatives. However, there can be no assurance that\nthe Company will be able to obtain adequate financings in the future, or at terms favorable to the Company.\nSignificant variations in the liquidity and capital resources for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are explained\nunder section 9.

Cash Flows.\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents and the disposal of a portion of the equipment classified as assets held for sale\nexplain mainly the decrease in total current assets.\nThe increase in mining interests is mainly due to the detailed engineering on reclamation work, water treatment, waste\nmanagement, the expenditures related to the permit application and for the bulk sample at the Cariboo Gold Project. The\ndecrease in property, plant and equipment is mainly related to the impairment charge recorded and described in section 8.\nFinancial Performance as well as depreciation expense for the period. The increase in exploration and evaluation is largely\nrelated to the resource estimate and exploration program on the Tintic Project.\nOther investments decreased due to the overall change in fair values and partial dispositions of holdings in the Company’s\ninvestment portfolio.\nThe increase in current liabilities is mainly due to the amount drawn on the Credit Facility and the classification of the warrant\nliability as current liabilities as a consequence of the application of the Amendments to IAS 1 as described in Note 3 to the\nunaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe increase in long-term debt is mainly due to additions to mining equipment financings. The decrease in environmental\nrehabilitation provision is explained by the reclassification to current liabilities in connection with the expected schedule of\nsettlement.\n25\nOsisko Development Corp.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe Company’s activities, being the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral properties in Canada and\nworldwide, is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Certain factors, including but not limited to the ones below,\ncould materially affect the Company’s financial condition and/or future operating results, and could cause actual events to\ndiffer materially from those described in forward-looking statements made by or related to the Company. Refer to the\n\"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" for more information. The reader should carefully consider these\nrisks as well as the information disclosed herein and, in the Company’s most recent unaudited condensed interim\nconsolidated financial statements and audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\nThe Company’s view of risks is not static, and readers are cautioned that there can be no assurance that all risks to the\nCompany, at any point in time, can be accurately identified, assessed as to significance or impact, managed or effective\ncontrolled or mitigated. There can be additional new or elevated risks to the Company that are not described herein.\nFor a comprehensive discussion of the risk factors that may affect the Company, its business operations and financial\nperformance, refer to the risk disclosure under the heading \"Risk Factors\" contained in the Company’s annual information\nform dated March 28, 2024, for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"AIF\"), which disclosure is hereby incorporated by\nreference herein. The AIF and other publicly filed disclosure regarding the Company, which are available electronically on\nSEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development's issuer profile.\nRisks relating to Additional Financing and Dilution\nOsisko Development's development and exploration activities are subject to financing risks. At the present time, the\nCompany has exploration and development assets which may generate periodic revenues through test mining but has no\nmines in the commercial production stage that generate positive cash flows. The Company cautions that test mining at its\noperations could be suspended at any time. The Company’s ability to explore for and discover potential economic projects,\nand then to bring them into production, is highly dependent upon its ability to raise equity and debt capital in the financial\nmarkets. Any projects that the Company develops will require significant capital expenditures. To obtain such funds, the\nCompany may sell additional securities including, but not limited to, the Company’s shares or some form of convertible\nsecurity, the effect of which may result in a substantial dilution of the equity interests of the Company’s Shareholders.\nAlternatively, the Company may also sell a part of its interest in an asset in order to raise capital. There is no assurance\nthat the Company will be able to raise the funds required to continue its exploration programs and finance the development\nof any potentially economic deposit that is identified on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to obtain the necessary\n32\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nfinancing(s) could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s growth strategy, results of operations, financial condition\nand project scheduling.\nRisks related to mining operations\nMining operations are and will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration, development and\nproduction of mineral resources and mineral reserves including unusual or unexpected geological formations and other\nconditions such as formation pressures, fire, power outages, flooding, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and the inability to\nobtain suitable machinery, equipment or labour, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property, and\npossible environmental damage that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate\nor adequately mitigate. The Company may be subject to liability for pollution, cave-ins or hazards against which it cannot\ninsure or against which it may elect not to insure. The payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial position of the Company.\nMajor expenditures are required to develop metallurgical processes and to construct mining and processing facilities at a\nparticular site. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are:\nthe particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which are highly\nvolatile; and governmental regulations, including those relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, allowable\nproduction, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection.\nOperations Not Supported by a Feasibility Study\nCertain operations of the Company including the test mining at Bonanza Ledge II Project and Trixie test mine, have operated\nwithout the benefit of a feasibility study including mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as\na result, there may be increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of material or the cost of such\nrecovery. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that\ncommercial production will commence, continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved.\nThe failure to commence or continue production would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability to generate\nrevenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse\nimpact on the Company’s cash flow and potential profitability.\nNegative Operating Cash Flow\nThe Company has negative cash flow from operations. As a result of the expected expenditures to be incurred by the\nCorporation for the development of the Company’s material projects, the Company anticipates that negative operating cash\nflows will continue until one or both of the Company’s material projects enters commercial production (if at all). There can\nbe no assurance that the Company will generate positive cash flow from operations in the future. The Company will require\nadditional capital in order to fund its future activities for its material projects. To the extent that the Company continues to\nhave negative operating cash flow in future periods, it may need to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to fund such\nnegative cash flow. Furthermore, additional financing, whether through the issue of additional equity and/or debt securities\nand/or project level debt, will be required to continue the development of the Company’s material projects and there is no\nassurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available or that these financings will be on terms at least\nas favourable to the Company as those previously obtained, or at all. Failure to obtain additional financing or to achieve\nprofitability and positive operating cash flows will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of\noperations.\nNo Earnings and History of Losses\nThe business of developing and exploring resource properties involves a high degree of risk and, therefore, there is no\nassurance that current exploration and test mining programs will result in profitable operations. The Company has not\ndetermined whether any of its properties contain economically recoverable reserves of mineralized material and currently\nhas minimal or no revenues from its projects; therefore, the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows from its\noperations. There can be no assurance that significant additional losses will not occur in the future. The Company’s\n33\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\noperating expenses and capital expenditures may increase in future years with advancing exploration, development, and/or\nproduction from the Company’s properties. The Company does not anticipate receiving sufficient revenues from operations\nto offset operational expenditures in the foreseeable future and expects to incur losses until such time as one or more of its\nproperties enters into commercial production and generates sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. There is no\nassurance that any of the Company’s properties will eventually graduate to commercial operation. There is also no\nassurance that new capital will become available, and if it is not, the Company may be forced to substantially curtail or\ncease operations.\nForeign Exchange Risks\nThe Company is subject to currency risks. The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar, which is exposed to\nfluctuations against other currencies. The Company’s activities are located in Canada, Mexico and the U.S.A., and as such\nmany of its expenditures and obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos. The Company maintains its\nprincipal office in Montreal (Canada), maintains cash accounts in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos and\nhas monetary assets and liabilities in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos.\nThe Company’s assets and liquidities are significantly affected by changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar and\nCanadian/Mexican peso exchange rates. Most expenses are currently denominated in Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and\nMexican pesos. Exchange rate movements can therefore have a significant impact on the Company’s costs. The\nappreciation of non-Canadian dollar currencies against the Canadian dollar can increase the costs of the Company’s\nactivities.\nRisks relating to Taxation Laws\nThe Company has operations and conducts business in multiple jurisdictions and it is subject to the taxation laws of each\nsuch jurisdiction. These taxation laws are complicated and subject to change. The Company may also be subject to review,\naudit and assessment in the ordinary course. Any such changes in taxation law or reviews and assessments could result in\nhigher taxes being payable or require payment of taxes due from previous years, which could adversely affect the\nCompany’s liquidities. Taxes may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to repatriate earnings and otherwise deploy\nits assets.\nPermits, Licences and Approvals\nThe operations of the Company require licences and permits from various governmental authorities. The Company believes\nit holds or is in the process of obtaining all necessary licences and permits to carry on the activities which it is currently\nconducting under applicable laws and regulations. Such licences and permits are subject to changes in regulations and in\nvarious operating circumstances. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary licences\nand permits that may be required to maintain its mining activities, construct mines or milling facilities and commence\noperations of any of its exploration properties. In addition, if the Company proceeds to production on any exploration\nproperty, it must obtain and comply with permits and licences which may contain specific conditions concerning operating\nprocedures, water use, the discharge of various materials into or on land, air or water, waste disposal, spills, environmental\nstudies, abandonment and restoration plans and financial assurances. There can be no assurance that the Company will\nbe able to obtain such permits and licences or that it will be able to comply with any such conditions.\nFirst Nations\nThe legal nature of first nation land claims is a matter of considerable complexity. The impact of any such claim on the\nCompany's material properties cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. There is no assurance that any first nation\nclaims, should they arise, can be successfully addressed. In the event a claim arose in respect of the Company's material\nproperty and not addressed successfully or in a timely manner, such claim may have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the process of addressing such\n34\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nclaims, regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time consuming and could result in delays which could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company's business and financial results.\nMineral resource and mineral reserve estimates have inherent uncertainty\nMineral resource and mineral reserve figures are only estimates. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on\nknowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results and industry practices. While the Company believes that the\nmineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, as applicable, in respect of properties in which the Company holds a direct\ninterest reflect best estimates, the estimating of mineral resources and mineral reserves is a subjective process and the\naccuracy of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, the\naccuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting available engineering\nand geological information. There is significant uncertainty in any mineral resource and mineral reserve estimate and the\nactual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from estimates. Estimated mineral\nresources and mineral reserves may have to be re-estimated based on changes in prices of gold or other minerals, further\nexploration or development activity or actual production experience. This could materially and adversely affect estimates of\nthe volume or grade of mineralization, estimated recovery rates or other important factors that influence such estimates. In\naddition, mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resource estimate will\nultimately be reclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not\nhave demonstrated economic viability.\nEconomics of developing mineral properties\nMineral exploration and development is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. While the discovery of an ore body\nmay result in substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are commercially mineable and ultimately developed\ninto producing mines. There is no assurance that any exploration properties will be commercially mineable.\nShould any mineral resources exist, substantial expenditures will be required to confirm mineral reserves which are sufficient\nto commercially mine and to obtain the required environmental approvals and permitting required to commence commercial\noperations. The decision as to whether a property contains a commercially viable mineral deposit and should be brought\ninto production will depend upon the results of exploration programs, preliminary economic assessment and/or feasibility\nstudies, and the recommendations of duly qualified engineers and/or geologists, all of which involves significant expense.\nThis decision will involve consideration and evaluation of several significant factors including, but not limited to: (a) costs of\nbringing a property into production, including exploration and development work, preparation of, if applicable, preliminary\neconomic assessment and production feasibility studies and construction of production facilities; (b) availability and costs\nof financing; (c) ongoing costs of production; (d) metal prices; (e) environmental compliance regulations and restraints\n(including potential environmental liabilities associated with historical exploration activities); and (f) political climate and/or\ngovernmental regulation and control. Development projects are also subject to the successful completion of engineering\nstudies, issuance of necessary governmental permits, and availability of adequate financing. Development projects have\nno operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow.\nUninsured Risks and Hazards\nMining is capital intensive and subject to a number of risks and hazards, including environmental pollution, accidents or\nspills, industrial and transportation accidents, labour disputes, changes in the regulatory environment, natural phenomena\n(such as inclement weather conditions, earthquakes, pit wall failures and cave-ins) and encountering unusual or unexpected\ngeological conditions. Such risk and hazards might impact the Company’s business. Consequently, many of the foregoing\nrisks and hazards could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company’s mineral properties or future processing\nfacilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in or interruption of or cessation of their exploration or\ndevelopment activities, delay in or inability to receive required regulatory approvals, or costs, monetary losses and potential\nlegal liability and adverse governmental action. Osisko Development may be subject to liability or sustain loss for certain\nrisks and hazards against which it does not or cannot insure or against which it may reasonably elect not to insure because\nof the cost. This lack of insurance coverage could result in material economic harm to the Company.\n35\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nFluctuation in market value of Osisko Development Common Shares\nThe market price of Osisko Development Common Shares is affected by many variables not directly related to the corporate\nperformance of the Company, including the strength of the economy generally, the availability and attractiveness of\nalternative investments, and the breadth of the public market for the stock. The effect of these and other factors on the\nmarket price of the Osisko Development Shares in the future cannot be predicted and may cause decreases in asset values,\nwhich may result in impairment losses.\n17. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (ICFR)\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be\ndisclosed in reports files with the securities regulatory authorities are recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a\ntimely fashion. The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by\nthe Company in such reports is then accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management to ensure timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Management regularly reviews disclosure controls and procedures; however, they\ncannot provide an absolute level of assurance because of the inherent limitations in control systems to prevent or detect all\nmisstatements due to error or fraud. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, along with Management, have\nevaluated and concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and appropriately designed\nas at September 30, 2024.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls\nover financial reporting. The Company’s internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with IFRS. Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management\nevaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making\nthe assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, the Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, together with Management, have evaluated whether there were changes to the ICFR\nduring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company’s ICFR. No such changes were identified through their evaluation. The Company’s\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that internal controls over financial\nreporting and disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations.\nTherefore, even those systems determined to be properly designed and effective can provide only reasonable assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met.\nLimitations of Controls and Procedures\nManagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and\nprocedures or internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system\nmust reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the reality judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or\nmistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more\npeople, or by unauthorized override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving\n36\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nits stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective\ncontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n18. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS\nPlease refer to the basis of presentation and statement of compliance in Note 2 of the Company’s unaudited condensed\ninterim consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024.\n19. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\nEstimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including\nexpectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The determination of estimates\nrequires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience and current\nand expected economic conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions as well as critical judgments in applying the Company’s accounting policies\nare detailed in the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAll financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. The fair value is based on quoted\nmarket prices, unless the financial instruments are not traded in an active market. In this case, the fair value is determined\nby using valuation techniques like discounted cash flows, the Black-Scholes option pricing model or other valuation\ntechniques. Measurement in subsequent periods depends on the classification of the financial instrument. A description of\nfinancial instruments and their fair value is included in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nManagement of Financial Risk\nCurrency Risk\nThe Company is exposed to financial risk due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company operates in the United\nStates and Canada, and a portion of its expenses are incurred in Canadian dollars. A significant change in the exchange\nrates between the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar could have an effect on the Company’s results of operations,\nfinancial position and cash flows. The Company has not hedged its exposure to currency fluctuations.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual\nobligations. The maximum credit risk the Company is exposed to is 100% of cash and cash equivalents and receivables.\nThe Company’s cash is held in large Canadian and U.S. financial institutions. The Company does not deem that it has\nsignificant credit risk exposure.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company\nhas a planning and budgeting process in place to help determine the funds required to support the Company’s normal\noperating requirements on an ongoing basis. The Company ensures that there are sufficient funds to meet its short-term\nbusiness requirements by taking into account anticipated cash expenditures for its exploration and operational activities.\n37\nOsisko Development Corp. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nThe Company will pursue additional equity, stream or debt financing as required to meet its long-term commitments. There\nis no assurance that such financing will be available or that it will be available on favorable terms.\n21.
