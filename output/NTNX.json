For the purposes of this calculation, we assume that the contract term begins on the date a contract is booked, unless the terms of such contract prevent us from fulfilling our obligations until a later period, and irrespective of the periods in which we would recognize revenue for such contract. Excludes all life-of-device contracts. **ACV** is defined as the total annualized value of a contract. The total annualized value for a contract is calculated by dividing the total value of the contract by the number of years in the term of such contract. Excludes amounts related to professional services and hardware._\n\n_2**Average Contract Duration** represents the dollar-weighted term, calculated on a billings basis, across all subscription contracts, as well as our limited number of life-of-device contracts, using an assumed term of five years for life-of-device licenses, executed in the period._\n\n_3 Weighted average share count used in computing diluted non-GAAP net income per share._\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Measures**\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following non-GAAP financial and other key performance measures: non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, free cash flow, Annual Recurring Revenue (or ARR), and Average Contract Duration. In computing non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items such as stock-based compensation and the related income tax impact, costs associated with our acquisitions (such as amortization of acquired intangible assets, income tax-related impact, and other acquisition-related costs), restructuring charges, litigation settlement accruals and legal fees related to certain litigation matters, the amortization and conversion of the debt discount and issuance costs related to convertible senior notes, interest expense related to convertible senior notes, and other non-recurring transactions and the related tax impact. Non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating margin are financial measures which we believe provide useful information to investors because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures such as stock-based compensation expense that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. Free cash flow is a performance measure that we believe provides useful information to our management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after capital expenditures, and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. ARR is a performance measure that we believe provides useful information to our management and investors as it allows us to better track the topline growth of our subscription business because it takes into account variability in term lengths. We use these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. However, these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow are not substitutes for gross margin, operating expenses, operating income (loss), operating margin, or net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, respectively. There is no GAAP measure that is comparable to ARR or Average Contract Duration, so we have not reconciled the ARR or Average Contract Duration data included in this press release to any GAAP measure. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. We urge you to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included below in the tables captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Profit Measures” and “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow,” and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. This press release also includes the following forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as part of our second quarter fiscal 2025 outlook and/or our fiscal 2025 outlook: non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow. We are unable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts, as we are currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact the GAAP financial measures for these periods but would not impact the non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains express and implied forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding: our business momentum and prospects; our innovations supporting our vision of becoming the leading platform for running applications and managing data, anywhere; strengthening our partner ecosystem; our focus on delivering sustainable, profitable growth; our second quarter fiscal 2025 outlook; and our fiscal 2025 outlook.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are not historical facts and instead are based on our current expectations, estimates, opinions, and beliefs.

Additional information will be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024, which should be read in conjunction with this press release and the financial results included herein.

\n_Subscription revenue —_ Subscription revenue includes any performance obligation which has a defined term, and is generated from the sales of software entitlement and support subscriptions, subscription software licenses and cloud-based software-as-a-service, or SaaS, offerings.\n\n  * Ratable — We recognize revenue from software entitlement and support subscriptions and SaaS offerings ratably over the contractual service period, the substantial majority of which relate to software entitlement and support subscriptions.\n  * Upfront — Revenue from our subscription software licenses is generally recognized upfront upon transfer of control to the customer, which happens when we make the software available to the customer.\n\n\n\n_Professional services revenue —_ We also sell professional services with our products. We recognize revenue related to professional services as they are performed.\n\n_Other non-subscription product revenue —_ Other non-subscription product revenue includes $8.1 million and $1.9 million of non-portable software revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $0.6 million and $1.1 million of hardware revenue for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\n  * Non-portable software revenue — Non-portable software revenue includes sales of our platform when delivered on a configured-to-order appliance by us or one of our OEM partners. The software licenses associated with these sales are typically non-portable and can be used over the life of the appliance on which the software is delivered. Revenue from our non-portable software products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\n  * Hardware revenue — In the infrequent transactions where the hardware appliance is purchased directly from Nutanix, we consider ourselves to be the principal in the transaction and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We consider the amount allocated to hardware revenue to be equivalent to the cost of the hardware procured. Hardware revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.\n\n\n\n**Annual Recurring Revenue****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended October 31,**  \n**2023**| **2024**  \n**(in thousands)**  \nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR)| $| 1,663,918| $| 1,966,105  \n  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Profit Measures****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**GAAP**| **Non-GAAP Adjustments**| **Non-GAAP**  \n**Three Months Ended October 31, 2024**| **(1****)**| **(2****)**| **(3****)**| **(4****)**| **(5****)**| **(6****)**| **Three Months Ended October 31, 2024**  \n**(in thousands, except percentages and per share data)**  \nGross profit| $| 508,286| $| 8,032| $| 767| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| 517,085  \nGross margin| 86.0| %| 1.4| %| 0.1| %| —| —| —| —| 87.5| %  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and marketing| 253,401| (20,648| )| (88| )| —| —| —| —| 232,665  \nResearch and development| 173,959| (43,562| )| —| —| —| —| —| 130,397  \nGeneral and administrative| 53,676| (16,507| )| —| (1,367| )| —| —| —| 35,802  \nTotal operating expenses| 481,036| (80,717| )| (88| )| (1,367| )| —| —| —| 398,864  \nIncome from operations| 27,250| 88,749| 855| 1,367| —| —| —| 118,221  \nOperating margin| 4.6| %| 15.1| %| 0.1| %| 0.2| %| —| —| —| 20.0| %  \nNet income| $| 29,926| $| 88,749| $| 855| $| 1,367| $| (110| )| $| 745| $| 241| $| 121,773  \nWeighted shares outstanding, basic| 266,556| 266,556  \nWeighted shares outstanding, diluted (7)| 288,829| 288,829  \nNet income per share, basic| $| 0.11| $| 0.34| $| -| $| 0.01| $| -| $| -| $| -| $| 0.46  \nNet income per share, diluted| $| 0.10| $| 0.42  \n  \n_____________(1) Stock-based compensation expense(2) Amortization of intangible assets(3) Legal fees(4) Other(5) Amortization of debt issuance costs related to convertible senior notes(6) Income tax effect primarily related to stock-based compensation expense(7) Includes 22,273 potentially dilutive shares related to convertible senior notes and the issuance of shares under employee equity incentive plans\n\n**GAAP**| **Non-GAAP Adjustments**| **Non-GAAP**  \n---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended October 31, 2023**| **(1****)**| **(2****)**| **(3****)**| **(4****)**| **(5****)**| **(6****)**| **Three Months Ended October 31, 2023**  \n**(in thousands, except percentages and per share data)**  \nGross profit| $| 429,095| $| 9,044| $| 1,111| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| 439,250  \nGross margin| 84.0| %| 1.7| %| 0.2| %| —| —| —| —| 85.9| %  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and marketing| 235,323| (21,471| )| (37| )| —| —| —| —| 213,815  \nResearch and development| 151,975| (38,404| )| —| —| —| —| —| 113,571  \nGeneral and administrative| 47,503| (15,079| )| —| (46| )| —| —| —| 32,378  \nTotal operating expenses| 434,801| (74,954| )| (37| )| (46| )| —| —| —| 359,764  \n(Loss) income from operations| (5,706| )| 83,998| 1,148| 46| —| —| —| 79,486  \nOperating margin| (1.1| )%| 16.5| %| 0.2| %| —| —| —| —| 15.6| %  \nNet (loss) income| $| (15,853| )| $| 83,998| $| 1,148| $| 46| $| 16,347| $| (920| )| $| 274| $| 85,040  \nWeighted shares outstanding, basic| 241,490| 241,490  \nWeighted shares outstanding, diluted (7)| 241,490| 292,861  \nNet (loss) income per share, basic| $| (0.07| )| $| 0.35| $| -| $| -| $| 0.07| $| -| $| -| $| 0.35  \nNet (loss) income per share, diluted| $| (0.07| )| $| 0.29  \n  \n_____________(1) Stock-based compensation expense(2) Amortization of intangible assets(3) Legal fees(4) Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and interest expense related to convertible senior notes(5) Other(6) Income tax effect primarily related to stock-based compensation expense(7) Includes 51,371 potentially dilutive shares related to convertible senior notes and the issuance of shares under employee equity incentive plans\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended October 31,**  \n**2023**| **2024**  \n**(in thousands)**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| $| 145,473| $| 161,751  \nPurchases of property and equipment| (13,020| )| (9,831| )  \nFree cash flow| $| 132,453| $| 151,920  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NDc1NTE1ZGEtY2I3MS00ZjBmLTliYTUtODg2MTI2MzQwZjliLTEyMDM3NDA=/tiny/Nutanix-Inc-.png)\n\n[](/ir-resources/email-alerts \"Email Alerts\")\n\n[](/rss-feeds \"RSS Feeds\")\n\n[](/ir-resources/contact-us \"Contact IR\")\n\nSearch Investor Relations ×\n"
