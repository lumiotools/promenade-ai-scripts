Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures below are useful measures of the Company's core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business, and help facilitate comparisons to Company operating performance across periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be used as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The following schedules reconcile the differences between financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data) | **Totaloperatingexpenses** | **Netoperatingincome** | **Totalnon-operatingincome (loss)** | **Income taxexpense**(4) | **Net income attributable to common shareholders** | **Earnings pershareattributable** **to commonshareholders- diluted** | **Netoperatingprofit margin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 28,801 | $ 10,217 | $ 9,669 | $ 5,242 | $ 14,645 | $ 5.35 | 26 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability(1) | (2,250) | 2,250 | (2,250) | — | — | — | 6 %  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | (7,419) | (1,956) | (5,463) | (2.00) | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 26,551 | $ 12,467 | $ — | $ 3,286 | $ 9,182 | $ 3.35 | 32 %  \n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**  \n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data) | **Total operating expenses** | **Netoperatingincome** | **Totalnon-operating** **income (loss)** | **Income taxexpense**(4) | **Net incomeattributable to commonshareholders** | **Earnings pershareattributableto commonshareholders- diluted** | **Net operatingprofit margin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 23,193 | $ 12,361 | $ (4,637) | $ 2,524 | $ 6,473 | $ 2.20 | 35 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability(1) | 859 | (859) | 859 | — | — | — | (2) %  \nConsolidated Fund(2) | — | 121 | 3,269 | 593 | 1,525 | 0.52 | —  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | 509 | 143 | 366 | 0.13 | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 24,052 | $ 11,623 | $ — | $ 3,260 | $ 8,364 | $ 2.85 | 33 %  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data) | **Total operatingexpenses** | **Netoperating income** | **Totalnon-operating income (loss)** | **Income taxexpense**(4) | **Net incomeattributableto commonshareholders** | **Earnings per share attributableto common shareholders- diluted** | **Net operatingprofit margin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 81,322 | $ 30,653 | $ 18,380 | $ 13,247 | $ 35,786 | $ 12.90 | 27 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability(1) | (4,571) | 4,571 | (4,571) | — | — | — | 4 %  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | (13,809) | (3,731) | (10,078) | (3.64) | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 76,751 | $ 35,224 | $ — | $ 9,516 | $ 25,708 | $ 9.26 | 31 %  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**  \n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data) | **Total operating** **expenses** | **Net operating income** | **Totalnon-operating income (loss)** | **Income taxexpense**(4) | **Net income** **attributable to common** **shareholders** | **Earnings pershare attributableto commonshareholders- diluted** | **Netoperatingprofit margin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 71,806 | $ 31,089 | $ 9,722 | $ 11,339 | $ 28,613 | $ 9.61 | 30 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability (1) | (1,868) | 1,868 | (1,868) | — | — | — | 2 %  \nConsolidated Fund(2) | — | 330 | (4,148) | (840) | (2,119) | (0.71) | —  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | (3,706) | (1,053) | (2,653) | (0.89) | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 69,938 | $ 33,287 | $ — | $ 9,446 | $ 23,841 | $ 8.01 | 32 %  \n  \n(1) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense resulting from market valuation changes in the Company's deferred compensation plans' liability and the related net gains/losses on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the deferred compensation plans are adjusted for appreciation/depreciation of investments chosen by participants. The Company believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income or loss realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help readers understand the Company's core operating results and to improve comparability from period to period.\n\n(2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact that the Consolidated Fund has on the Company's GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, the Company adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the Consolidated Fund. The adjustment to net operating income represents the operating expenses of the Consolidated Fund, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to common shareholders represents the net income of the Consolidated Fund, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company believes removing the impact of the Consolidated Fund helps readers understand its core operating results and improves comparability from period to period.\n\n(3) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the net gains or losses earned on the Company's non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the deferred compensation plans' liability, non-consolidated seed investments, and other investments. The Company believes adjusting for these non-operating income or loss items helps readers understand the Company's core operating results and improves comparability from period to period.\n\n(4) The income tax expense impacts were calculated and resulted in the overall non-GAAP effective tax rates of 26.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 28.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, 27.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 28.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company does not recommend that investors consider non-GAAP financial measures alone, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThroughout this press release, the Company may make \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended (the \"PSLR Act\"), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding anticipated operating results, prospects and levels of AUM or AUA, technological developments, economic trends (including interest rates and market volatility), expected transactions and similar matters.

Similarly, descriptions of the Company's objectives, strategies, plans, goals, or targets are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's expectations at the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, accordingly, the Company's actual results and experiences may differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements.\n\nFactors that may cause the Company's actual results or experiences to differ materially from results discussed in forward-looking statements are discussed under Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) and elsewhere in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) any reduction in the Company's AUM or AUA; (ii) withdrawal, renegotiation, or termination of investment advisory agreements; (iii) damage to the Company's reputation; (iv) failure to comply with investment guidelines or other contractual requirements; (v) challenges from the competition the Company faces in its business; (vi) challenges from industry trends towards lower fee strategies and model portfolio arrangements; (vii) adverse regulatory and legal developments; (viii) unfavorable changes in tax laws or limitations; (ix) interruptions in or failure to provide critical technological service by the Company or third parties; (x) adverse civil litigation and government investigations or proceedings; (xi) failure to adapt to or successfully incorporate technological changes, such as artificial intelligence, into the Company's business; (xii) risk of loss on the Company's investments; (xiii) lack of sufficient capital on satisfactory terms; (xiv) losses or costs not covered by insurance; (xv) a decline in the performance of the Company's products; (xvi) changes in interest rates and inflation; (xvii) changes in national and local economic and political conditions; (xviii) the continuing economic uncertainty in various parts of the world; (xix) the after-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in connection therewith; (xx) political uncertainty caused by, among other things, political parties, economic nationalist sentiments, tensions surrounding the current socioeconomic landscape; and (xxi) other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company's public documents on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn light of the significant uncertainties in forward-looking statements, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that its expectations, objectives and plans will be achieved. All forward-looking statements made in this press release are based on information presently available to the management of the Company and speak only as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and factors that the Company currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the Company to predict these events or how they may affect it. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as required by law, although it may do so from time to time. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\n\n[](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/410236/Diamond_Hill_Logo.html)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CL47931&sd=2024-11-04) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/diamond-hill-investment-group-inc-reports-results-for-third-quarter-2024-and-declares-quarterly-dividend-302295823.html>\n\nSOURCE Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.\n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n[back to top](#top)\n\n  * [Strategies](http://www.diamond-hill.com/strategies/)\n\n\n  * [About Us](http://www.diamond-hill.com/about-us/)\n\n\n  * [Insights](http://www.diamond-hill.com/insights/)\n\n\n\n[ ![](//s25.q4cdn.com/289401233/files/images/irw/DH-navy-logo-footer.svg) ](https://www.diamond-hill.com/)\n\n  * [Safe Harbor Statement](https://www.diamond-hill.com/content/safe-harbor-statement/)\n  * [Email Notification](https://ir.diamond-hill.com/email-notification/default.aspx)\n  * [FAQ](https://ir.diamond-hill.com/faq/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n© 2022 Diamond Hill All Rights Reserved\n"

Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures below are useful measures of the Company's core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business, and help facilitate comparisons to Company operating performance across periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. The following schedules reconcile the differences between financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30, 2024**  \n---  \n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data) | **Total operating expenses** | **Net operating income** | **Total non-operating income (loss)** | **Income tax expense**(4) | **Net income attributable to common shareholders** | **Earnings per share attributable to common shareholders - diluted** | **Net operating profit margin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 24,529 | $ 12,133 | $ (655) | $ 3,352 | $ 8,126 | $ 2.93 | 33 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability(1) | 869 | (869) | 869 | — | — | — | (2) %  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | (214) | (62) | (152) | (0.05) | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 25,398 | $ 11,264 | $ — | $ 3,290 | $ 7,974 | $ 2.88 | 31 %  \n**Three Months Ended June 30, 2023**  \n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data) | **Total operating expenses** | **Net operating income** | **Total non-operating income (loss)** | **Income tax expense**(4) | **Net income attributable to common shareholders** | **Earnings per share attributable to common shareholders - diluted** | **Net operating profit margin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 25,564 | $ 7,786 | $ 6,277 | $ 3,894 | $ 9,432 | $ 3.18 | 23 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability(1) | (1,983) | 1,983 | (1,983) | — | — | — | 7 %  \nConsolidated Funds(2) | — | 110 | (2,393) | (452) | (1,095) | (0.37) | —  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | (1,901) | (555) | (1,346) | (0.46) | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 23,581 | $ 9,879 | $ — | $ 2,887 | $ 6,991 | $ 2.35 | 30 %  \n**Six Months Ended June 30, 2024**  \n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data) | **Total operating expenses** | **Net operating income** | **Total non-operating income (loss)** | **Income tax expense**(4) | **Net income attributable to common shareholders** | **Earnings per share attributable to common shareholders - diluted** | **Net operating profit margin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 52,521 | $ 20,435 | $ 8,711 | $ 8,005 | $ 21,142 | $ 7.57 | 28 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability(1) | (2,321) | 2,321 | (2,321) | — | — | — | 3 %  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | (6,390) | (1,757) | (4,633) | (1.66) | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 50,200 | $ 22,756 | $ — | $ 6,248 | $ 16,509 | $ 5.91 | 31 %  \n**Six Months Ended June 30, 2023**  \n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data) | **Total operating expenses** | **Net operating income** | **Total non-operating income (loss)** | **Income tax expense**(4) | **Net income attributable to common shareholders** | **Earnings per share attributable to common shareholders - diluted** | **Net operating profit margin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 48,613 | $ 18,728 | $ 14,359 | $ 8,815 | $ 22,140 | $ 7.39 | 28 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability (1) | (2,727) | 2,727 | (2,727) | — | — | — | 4 %  \nConsolidated Funds(2) | — | 209 | (7,418) | (1,447) | (3,630) | (1.21) | —  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | (4,214) | (1,201) | (3,013) | (1.01) | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 45,886 | $ 21,664 | $ — | $ 6,167 | $ 15,497 | $ 5.17 | 32 %  \n  \n(1) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense resulting from market valuation changes in the Company's deferred compensation plans' liability and the related net gains/losses on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the deferred compensation plans are adjusted for appreciation/depreciation of investments chosen by participants. The Company believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income or loss realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help readers understand the Company's core operating results and to improve comparability from period to period.\n\n(2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact that the Consolidated Fund has on the Company's GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, the Company adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the Consolidated Fund. The adjustment to net operating income represents the operating expenses of the Consolidated Fund, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to common shareholders represents the net income of the Consolidated Fund, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company believes removing the impact of the Consolidated Fund helps readers understand its core operating results and improves comparability from period to period.\n\n(3) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the net gains or losses earned on the Company's non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the deferred compensation plans' liability, non-consolidated seed investments, and other investments. The Company believes adjusting for these non-operating income or loss items helps readers understand the Company's core operating results and improves comparability from period to period.\n\n(4) The income tax expense impacts were calculated and resulted in the overall non-GAAP effective tax rates of 29.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, 29.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2023, 27.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 28.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2023\n\nThe Company does not recommend that investors consider non-GAAP financial measures alone, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThroughout this press release, the Company may make \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended (the \"PSLR Act\"), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

All forward-looking statements made in this press release are based on information presently available to the management of the Company and speak only as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and factors that the Company currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the Company to predict these events or how they may affect it. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as required by law, although it may do so from time to time. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\n\n[](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/410236/Diamond_Hill_Logo.html)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CL72079&sd=2024-07-31) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/diamond-hill-investment-group-inc-reports-results-for-second-quarter-2024-and-declares-quarterly-dividend-302210088.html>\n\nSOURCE Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.\n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n[back to top](#top)\n\n  * [Strategies](http://www.diamond-hill.com/strategies/)\n\n\n  * [About Us](http://www.diamond-hill.com/about-us/)\n\n\n  * [Insights](http://www.diamond-hill.com/insights/)\n\n\n\n[ ![](//s25.q4cdn.com/289401233/files/images/irw/DH-navy-logo-footer.svg) ](https://www.diamond-hill.com/)\n\n  * [Safe Harbor Statement](https://www.diamond-hill.com/content/safe-harbor-statement/)\n  * [Email Notification](https://ir.diamond-hill.com/email-notification/default.aspx)\n  * [FAQ](https://ir.diamond-hill.com/faq/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n© 2022 Diamond Hill All Rights Reserved\n"

Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures below are useful measures of the Company's core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business, and help facilitate comparisons to Company operating performance across periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. The following schedules reconcile the differences between financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Three Months Ended March 31, 2024**  \n---  \n(in thousands, except percentagesand per share data) | **Totaloperatingexpenses** | **Netoperatingincome** | **Total non-operatingincome(loss)** | **Income taxexpense**(4) | **Net incomeattributableto commonshareholders** | **Earnings pershareattributableto commonshareholders- diluted** | **Netoperatingprofitmargin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 27,992 | $ 8,303 | $ 9,366 | $ 4,653 | $ 13,016 | $ 4.62 | 23 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability(1) | (3,190) | 3,190 | (3,190) | — | — | — | 9 %  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | (6,176) | (1,624) | (4,552) | (1.62) | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 24,802 | $ 11,493 | $ — | $ 3,029 | $ 8,464 | $ 3.00 | 32 %  \n**Three Months Ended March 31, 2023**  \n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data) | **Totaloperatingexpenses** | **Netoperatingincome** | **Total non-operatingincome(loss)** | **Income taxexpense**(4) | **Net incomeattributableto commonshareholders** | **Earnings pershareattributableto commonshareholders- diluted** | **Netoperatingprofit margin**  \n**GAAP Basis** | $ 23,049 | $ 10,942 | $ 8,083 | $ 4,921 | $ 12,708 | $ 4.20 | 32 %  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nDeferred compensation liability (1) | (745) | 745 | (745) | — | — | — | 3 %  \nConsolidated Fund(2) | — | 99 | (5,024) | (985) | (2,544) | (0.84) | —  \nOther investment income(3) | — | — | (2,314) | (646) | (1,668) | (0.55) | —  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP basis** | $ 22,304 | $ 11,786 | $ — | $ 3,290 | $ 8,496 | $ 2.81 | 35 %  \n  \n(1) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense resulting from market valuation changes in the Company's deferred compensation plans' liability and the related net gains/losses on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the deferred compensation plans are adjusted for appreciation/depreciation of investments chosen by participants. The Company believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income or loss realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help readers understand the Company's core operating results and to improve comparability from period to period.\n\n(2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact that the Consolidated Fund has on the Company's GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, the Company adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the Consolidated Fund. The adjustment to net operating income represents the operating expenses of the Consolidated Fund, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to common shareholders represents the net income of the Consolidated Fund, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company believes removing the impact of the Consolidated Fund helps readers understand its core operating results and improves comparability from period to period.\n\n(3) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the net gains or losses earned on the Company's non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the deferred compensation plans' liability, non-consolidated seed investments, and other investments. The Company believes adjusting for these non-operating income or loss items helps readers understand the Company's core operating results and improves comparability from period to period.\n\n(4) The income tax expense impacts were calculated and resulted in the overall non-GAAP effective tax rates of 26.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 27.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company does not recommend that investors consider non-GAAP financial measures alone, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThroughout this press release, the Company may make \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended (the \"PSLR Act\"), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are provided under the \"safe harbor\" protection of the PSLR Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding anticipated operating results, prospects and levels of AUM or AUA, technological developments, economic trends (including interest rates and market volatility), expected transactions and similar matters. The words \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"target,\" \"goal,\" \"project,\" \"estimate,\" \"guidance,\" \"forecast,\" \"outlook,\" \"would,\" \"will,\" \"continue,\" \"likely,\" \"should,\" \"hope,\" \"seek,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Similarly, descriptions of the Company's objectives, strategies, plans, goals, or targets are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's expectations at the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, accordingly, the Company's actual results and experiences may differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements.\n\nFactors that may cause the Company's actual results or experiences to differ materially from results discussed in forward-looking statements are discussed under Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) and elsewhere in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) any reduction in the Company's AUM or AUA; (ii) withdrawal, renegotiation, or termination of investment advisory agreements; (iii) damage to the Company's reputation; (iv) failure to comply with investment guidelines or other contractual requirements; (v) challenges from the competition the Company faces in its business; (vi) challenges from industry trends towards lower fee strategies and model portfolio arrangements; (vii) adverse regulatory and legal developments; (viii) unfavorable changes in tax laws or limitations; (ix) interruptions in or failure to provide critical technological service by the Company or third parties; (x) adverse civil litigation and government investigations or proceedings; (xi) failure to adapt to or successfully incorporate technological changes, such as artificial intelligence, into the Company's business; (xii) risk of loss on the Company's investments; (xiii) lack of sufficient capital on satisfactory terms; (xiv) losses or costs not covered by insurance; (xv) a decline in the performance of the Company's products; (xvi) changes in interest rates and inflation; (xvii) changes in national and local economic and political conditions; (xviii) the continuing economic uncertainty in various parts of the world; (xix) the after-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in connection therewith; (xx) political uncertainty caused by, among other things, political parties, economic nationalist sentiments, tensions surrounding the current socioeconomic landscape; and (xxi) other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company's public documents on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn light of the significant uncertainties in forward-looking statements, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that its expectations, objectives and plans will be achieved. All forward-looking statements made in this press release are based on information presently available to the management of the Company and speak only as of the date hereof. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and factors that the Company currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the Company to predict these events or how they may affect it. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as required by law, although it may do so from time to time. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\n\n[](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/410236/Diamond_Hill_Logo.html)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CL09247&sd=2024-05-08) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/diamond-hill-investment-group-inc-reports-results-for-first-quarter-2024-and-declares-quarterly-dividend-302140217.html>\n\nSOURCE Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.\n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n[back to top](#top)\n\n  * [Strategies](http://www.diamond-hill.com/strategies/)\n\n\n  * [About Us](http://www.diamond-hill.com/about-us/)\n\n\n  * [Insights](http://www.diamond-hill.com/insights/)\n\n\n\n[ ![](//s25.q4cdn.com/289401233/files/images/irw/DH-navy-logo-footer.svg) ](https://www.diamond-hill.com/)\n\n  * [Safe Harbor Statement](https://www.diamond-hill.com/content/safe-harbor-statement/)\n  * [Email Notification](https://ir.diamond-hill.com/email-notification/default.aspx)\n  * [FAQ](https://ir.diamond-hill.com/faq/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n© 2022 Diamond Hill All Rights Reserved\n"

Organization\nDiamond Hill Investment Group, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“DHIL” and, collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”),\nderives its consolidated revenues and net income from investment advisory and fund administration services provided by its\nwholly-owned subsidiary, Diamond Hill Capital Management, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“DHCM”).\nDHCM is a registered investment adviser. DHCM is the investment adviser and administrator for the Diamond Hill Funds (the\n“Funds”), a series of open-end mutual funds. DHCM also provides investment advisory services to Diamond Hill Micro Cap\nFund, LP (“DHMF”), a private fund, as well as separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts (“CITs”), other\npooled vehicles including sub-advised funds, and model delivery programs.\nNote 2 Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited, condensed, and consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, have been prepared\nin accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the instructions to Form 10-Q,\nand Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the accompanying financial\nstatements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the\nopinion of the Company’s management (“management”), all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered\nnecessary for a fair statement of the financial condition and results of operations as of the dates, and for the interim periods,\npresented, have been included. The accompanying unaudited, condensed, and consolidated financial statements and these\nfootnotes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in its\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”), as filed with the SEC.\nOperating results for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults the Company may expect for any fiscal quarter, the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, or any subsequent period.\nFor further information regarding the risks to the Company’s business, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes\nthereto in the 2023 Form 10-K, as well as “Part I – Item 1A. – Risk Factors” of the 2023 Form 10-K, the “Cautionary Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” in “Part I – Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Form 10-Q”), and “Part II – Item 1A. – Risk Factors”\nof this Form 10-Q.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying unaudited, condensed, and consolidated financial statements requires management to\nmake estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting\nperiod. Estimates have been prepared based on the most current and best available information, but actual results could differ\nmaterially from those estimates.\n8\nTable of Contents\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts and disclosures may have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s financial\npresentation.\nPrior to January 1, 2024, the Company recorded share repurchases as a reduction to common shares in permanent shareholders’\nequity. Effective January 1, 2024, share repurchases have been recorded as a reduction to retained earnings in permanent\nshareholders’ equity. The Company has not reclassified any share repurchases included in common shares prior to January 1,\n2024.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited, condensed, and consolidated financial statements include the operations of DHIL and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nDHCM holds certain investments in the Funds and DHMF for general corporate investment purposes, to provide seed capital\nfor newly formed strategies, or to add capital to existing strategies. The Funds are organized in a series fund structure in which\nthere are multiple mutual funds within one trust (the “Trust”). The Trust is an open-end investment company registered under\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Each individual Fund represents a separate share class of\na legal entity organized under the Trust. DHMF is organized as a Delaware limited partnership and is exempt from registration\nunder the 1940 Act.\nDHIL consolidates those subsidiaries and investments over which it has a controlling interest. The Company is generally\ndeemed to have a controlling interest when it owns the majority of the voting interest of a voting rights entity (“VRE”) or is\ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). A VIE is an entity that lacks sufficient equity to\nfinance its activities or any entity whose equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally\nassociated with an equity investment. The Company’s analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves\njudgment and consideration of several factors, including an entity’s legal organization, equity structure, the rights of the\ninvestment holders, the Company’s ownership interest in the entity, and the Company’s contractual involvement with the entity.\nThe Company continually reviews and reconsiders its controlling interest, VIE, and VRE conclusions upon the occurrence of\ncertain events, such as changes to its ownership interest or amendments to contract documents.\nThe Company performs its consolidation analysis at the individual Fund level and has concluded that the Funds are VREs,\nbecause the structure of the Funds is such that the shareholders are deemed to have the power through voting rights to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact each Fund’s economic performance. The Funds are consolidated if DHIL ownership,\ndirectly or indirectly, represents a majority interest (greater than 50%). The Company records redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests in consolidated investments for which the Company’s ownership is less than 100%. As of December 31, 2023 and\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had not consolidated any of the Funds. During the three-month and nine-month periods\nended September 30, 2023, the Company consolidated the Diamond Hill International Fund. Each Fund consolidated during\nthe applicable period is referred to as a “Consolidated Fund”.\nDHCM is the investment adviser to DHMF and is the managing member of Diamond Hill Fund GP, LLC (the “General\nPartner”), which is the general partner of DHMF. DHCM is wholly owned by, and consolidated with, DHIL. Further, through\nits control of the General Partner, DHCM has the power to direct DHMF’s economic activities and the right to receive\ninvestment advisory fees from DHMF that may be significant. DHMF commenced operations on June 1, 2021, and its\nunderlying assets consist primarily of marketable securities.\nThe Company concluded DHMF was a VIE given that: (i) DHCM has disproportionately less voting interest than economic\ninterest, and (ii) DHMF’s limited partners have full power to remove the General Partner (which is controlled by DHCM, and\nDHCM is controlled by DHIL) due to the existence of substantive kick-out rights. In addition, substantially all of DHMF’s\nactivities are conducted on behalf of the General Partner, which has disproportionately few voting rights. The Company\nconcluded it is not the primary beneficiary of DHMF as it lacks the power to control DHMF, since DHMF’s limited partners\nhave single-party kick-out rights and can unilaterally remove the General Partner without cause. DHCM’s investments in\nDHMF are reported as a component of the Company’s investment portfolio and valued at DHCM’s respective share of\nDHMF’s net income or loss.\nGains and losses attributable to changes in the value of DHCM’s interests in DHMF are included in the Company’s reported\ninvestment income. The Company’s exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with DHMF is limited to the amount of its\ninvestment. DHCM is not obligated to provide, and has not provided, financial or other support to DHMF, except for its\ninvestment in DHMF to date and its contractually provided investment advisory responsibilities. The Company has not\n9\nTable of Contents\nprovided liquidity arrangements, guarantees, or other commitments to support DHMF’s operations, and DHMF’s creditors and\ninterest holders have no recourse to the general credit of the Company.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest represents third-party interests in the Consolidated Fund. This interest is redeemable at the\noption of the investors, and therefore, is not treated as permanent equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is recorded at\nredemption value, which approximates the fair value each reporting period.\nSegment Information\nManagement has determined that the Company operates as a single business segment, which is providing investment advisory\nand related services to clients. Therefore, the Company does not present disclosures relating to operating segments in annual or\ninterim financial statements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and money market mutual funds held by DHCM. The Company considers\nall highly liquid temporary cash instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The\nCompany places its cash on deposit with U.S. financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. The Company’s credit risk in the event of failure of these financial institutions is\nrepresented by the difference between the FDIC limit and the total amount on deposit. Management monitors the financial\ninstitutions’ creditworthiness in conjunction with balances on deposit to minimize risk. The Company has amounts on deposit\nin excess of the insured limits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $2.0 million and $31.7 million in demand deposits\nand money market mutual funds, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $2.8 million and $44.2 million in\ndemand deposits and money market mutual funds, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company records accounts receivable when they are due and presents them on the balance sheet net of any allowance for\ndoubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible. Any allowance for\ndoubtful accounts is estimated based on the Company’s historical losses, existing conditions in the industry, and the financial\nstability of the individual or entity that owes the receivable. No allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary at\neither September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023. Accounts receivable from the Funds were $10.0 million as of September 30,\n2024, and $9.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\nInvestments\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of the Company’s investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates\nits determination each reporting period.\nCompany sponsored investments, where the Company has neither the control nor the ability to exercise significant influence, as\nwell as securities held in the Consolidated Fund, are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains\nand losses are recorded as investment income (loss) in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.\nInvestments classified as equity method investments represent investments in which the Company owns 20% to 50% of the\noutstanding voting interests in the entity or where it is determined that the Company is able to exercise significant influence but\nnot control over the investments. When using the equity method, the Company recognizes its respective share of the investee’s\nnet income or loss for the period, which is recorded as investment income (loss) in the Company’s consolidated statements of\nincome.\n10\nTable of Contents\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, consisting of leasehold improvements, right-of-use lease assets, computer equipment, capitalized\nsoftware, furniture, and fixtures, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-\nline method over the estimated lives of the assets.\nImplementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software, including hosting arrangements, are capitalized and\nexpensed on a straight-line basis over either the estimated useful life of the respective software or the term of the hosting\narrangement.\nProperty and equipment is tested for impairment when there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable. When an asset is determined to not be recoverable, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess, if any, of\nthe carrying value of the asset over its fair value.\nRevenue Recognition – General\nThe Company recognizes revenue when DHCM satisfies performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a client.\nThe Company earns substantially all of its revenue from DHCM investment advisory and fund administration contracts.\nInvestment advisory and fund administration fees, generally calculated as a percentage of assets under management (“AUM”),\nare recorded as revenue as services are performed. In addition to fixed fees based on a percentage of AUM, one client account\nalso provides periodic performance-based fees.\nRevenue from contracts with clients that was earned during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nMutual fund\nInvestment advisory Total revenue\nadministration, net\nDiamond Hill Funds $ 23,595,204 $ 1,788,357 $ 25,383,561\nSeparately managed accounts, excluding performance-\nbased fees 6,698,073 — 6,698,073\nOther pooled vehicles 2,878,015 — 2,878,015\nCollective investment trusts 1,839,850 — 1,839,850\nModel delivery 1,331,016 — 1,331,016\nPerformance-based fees 887,717 — 887,717\n$ 37,229,875 $ 1,788,357 $ 39,018,232\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nMutual fund\nInvestment advisory Total revenue\nadministration, net\nDiamond Hill Funds $ 21,714,872 $ 1,885,929 $ 23,600,801\nSeparately managed accounts, excluding performance-\nbased fees 6,150,388 — 6,150,388\nOther pooled vehicles 2,451,019 — 2,451,019\nModel delivery 1,306,460 — 1,306,460\nPerformance-based fees 1,176,351 — 1,176,351\nCollective investment trusts 869,261 — 869,261\n$ 33,668,351 $ 1,885,929 $ 35,554,280\n11\nTable of Contents\nRevenue from contracts with clients that was earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, include:\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nMutual fund\nInvestment advisory Total revenue\nadministration, net\nDiamond Hill Funds $ 68,249,762 $ 5,551,702 $ 73,801,464\nSeparately managed accounts, excluding performance-\nbased fees 20,083,201 — 20,083,201\nOther pooled vehicles 8,522,431 — 8,522,431\nCollective investment trusts 4,805,245 — 4,805,245\nModel delivery 3,874,437 — 3,874,437\nPerformance-based fees 887,717 — 887,717\n$ 106,422,793 $ 5,551,702 $ 111,974,495\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nMutual fund\nInvestment advisory Total revenue\nadministration, net\nDiamond Hill Funds $ 64,019,839 $ 5,684,167 $ 69,704,006\nSeparately managed accounts, excluding performance-\nbased fees 18,653,260 — 18,653,260\nOther pooled vehicles 6,785,722 — 6,785,722\nModel delivery 3,969,604 — 3,969,604\nCollective investment trusts 2,606,477 — 2,606,477\nPerformance-based fees 1,176,351 — 1,176,351\n$ 97,211,253 $ 5,684,167 $ 102,895,420\nRevenue Recognition – Investment Advisory Fees\nDHCM’s investment advisory contracts with clients have a single performance obligation because the contracted services are\nnot separately identifiable from other obligations in the contracts, and therefore, are not distinct. All obligations to provide\ninvestment advisory services are satisfied over time by DHCM.\nThe fees DHCM receives for its services under its investment advisory contracts are based on AUM, which changes based on\nthe value of securities held under each investment advisory contract. These fees are thereby constrained and represent variable\nconsideration, and they are excluded from revenue until the AUM on which DHCM’s client is billed are no longer subject to\nmarket fluctuations.\nDHCM also provides its strategy-specific model portfolios and related services to sponsors of model delivery programs. For its\nservices, DHCM is paid a model delivery fee by the program sponsor at a pre-determined rate based on the amount of assets\nunder advisement (“AUA”) in the program.\n12\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition – Performance-Based Fees\nDHCM manages a client account that pays performance-based fees. These fees are calculated based on the client’s investment\nresults over rolling five-year periods. The Company records the performance-based fees when it is probable that a significant\nreversal of the revenue will not occur. The Company recorded performance-based fees of $0.9 million during the three-month\nand nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and $1.2 million during the three-month and nine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Since the completion of the initial five-year contract measurement term, the performance-based fee has\nbeen calculated annually based on the client investment results over the most recently completed five-year period. The\nCompany’s next performance measurement period will be the 12 months ending September 30, 2025. AUM subject to that\nperformance-based fee was approximately $531.6 million as of September 30, 2024.\nRevenue Recognition – Mutual Fund Administration\nDHCM has an administrative and transfer agency services agreement with the Funds under which DHCM performs certain\nservices for each Fund. These services include performance obligations, such as mutual fund administration, fund accounting,\ntransfer agency, and other related functions. These services are performed concurrently under DHCM’s agreement with the\nFunds. All performance obligations to provide these administrative services are satisfied over time, and the Company\nrecognizes the related revenue as time progresses. Each Fund pays DHCM a fee for performing these services, which is\ncalculated using an annual rate multiplied by the average daily net assets of each respective Fund share class. These fees are\nthereby constrained and represent variable consideration, and are excluded from revenue until the AUM on which DHCM bills\nthe Funds are no longer subject to market fluctuations.\nThe Funds have selected and contractually engaged certain vendors to fulfill various services to benefit the Funds’ shareholders\nor to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Funds. These services include, among others, required shareholder mailings, federal\nand state registrations, and legal and audit services. In fulfilling a portion of its role under the administration and transfer\nagency services agreement with the Funds, DHCM acts as agent and pays for these services on behalf of the Funds. Each\nvendor is independently responsible for fulfillment of the services it has been engaged to provide and negotiates its fees and\nterms directly with the Funds’ management and board of trustees. Each year, the Funds’ board of trustees reviews the fee that\neach Fund pays to DHCM, and specifically considers the contractual expenses that DHCM pays on behalf of the Funds. As a\nresult, DHCM is not involved in the delivery or pricing of these services, and bears no risk related to these services. Revenue\nhas been recorded net of these Fund-related expenses.\nMutual fund administration gross and net revenue are summarized below:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nMutual fund administration:\nAdministration revenue, gross $ 6,402,818 $ 5,491,424 $ 18,051,623 $ 16,247,752\nFund related expense (4,614,461) (3,605,495) (12,499,921) (10,563,585)\nMutual fund administration revenue, net $ 1,788,357 $ 1,885,929 $ 5,551,702 $ 5,684,167\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for current and deferred income taxes through an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets are\nrecognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred\ntax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on\nthe date of enactment.\nThe Company is subject to examination by federal and applicable state and local jurisdictions for various tax periods. The\nCompany’s income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the\njurisdictions in which it does business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the\ndifferences and interplay in tax laws among those jurisdictions, and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of\ncomplex tax audit matters, the Company’s estimates of income tax liabilities may differ materially from actual payments or\nassessments. The Company regularly assesses its positions with regard to tax exposures and records liabilities for these\nuncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties, if any, according to the principles of Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes. The Company records interest and penalties\nwithin income tax expense on the income statement. See Note 8.\n13\nTable of Contents\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) are computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of DHIL common shares outstanding for the period, which includes unvested restricted shares. See\nNote 9.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nThe Company did not adopt any new accounting guidance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that had a\nmaterial effect on its financial position or results of operations.\nNewly Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Guidance\nIn December 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures.” This update requires certain revisions to income tax disclosures, primarily disclosures related to rate\nreconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. The Company does not believe that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will materially impact its financial\nstatements.\nIn November 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures.” The amendment requires annual and interim disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly\nprovided to the chief operating decision maker by reportable segment and clarifies that single reportable segment entities are\nrequired to apply all existing segment disclosures in the guidance. ASU 2023-07 is effective for financial statements issued for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company does not believe that adoption of ASU 2023-07 will\nmaterially impact its financial statements.\n14\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 Investments\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company’s investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023:\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFair value investments:\nCompany sponsored investments $ 66,575,315 $ 63,208,573\nCompany sponsored equity method investments 96,688,568 84,530,289\nTotal Investments $ 163,263,883 $ 147,738,862\nThe components of net investment income (loss) are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRealized gains $ 70,138 $ 211,446 $ 1,080,393 $ 1,017,983\nChange in unrealized 8,620,510 (6,283,344) 14,579,579 4,367,873\nDividends 997,553 1,457,543 2,773,166 4,497,091\nOther (19,240) (22,597) (53,090) (160,453)\nInvestment income (loss), net $ 9,668,961 $ (4,636,952) $ 18,380,048 $ 9,722,494\nCompany-Sponsored Equity Method Investments\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s equity method investments consisted of DHMF, the Diamond Hill International\nFund, and the Diamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund. The Company’s ownership percentage in these investments was\n84%, 42%, and 44%, respectively. The Company’s ownership in DHMF, the Diamond Hill International Fund, and the\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund includes $8.4 million of investments held in the Deferred Compensation Plans (as\ndefined in Note 6).\nThe following table includes the condensed summary financial information from the Company’s equity method investments as\nof, and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended, September 30, 2024:\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTotal assets $ 211,042,839\nTotal liabilities 8,623,462\nNet assets 202,419,377\nDHCM’s portion of net assets $ 96,688,568\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nInvestment income $ 929,969 $ 3,506,857\nExpenses 420,777 1,241,399\nNet realized gains 120,769 3,313,234\nChange in unrealized 11,228,899 18,153,145\nNet income 11,858,860 23,731,837\nDHCM’s portion of net income $ 5,804,877 $ 11,705,156\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s investments at September 30, 2024 include its interest in DHMF, an unconsolidated VIE, as the Company is\nnot deemed the primary beneficiary. The Company’s maximum risk of loss related to its involvement with DHMF is limited to\nthe carrying value of its investment, which was $20.7 million as of September 30, 2024.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company determines the fair value of its cash equivalents and certain investments using the following broad levels listed\nbelow:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets\nthat are not active; and model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable.\nLevel 3 - Valuations derived from techniques in which significant inputs are unobservable. The Company does not value any\ninvestments using Level 3 inputs.\nThese levels are not necessarily indicative of the risk or liquidity associated with investments.\nThe following table summarizes investments that are recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet using fair value\nmeasurements (excluding investments classified as equity method investments) determined based upon the differing levels as of\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents $ 31,690,501 — — $ 31,690,501\nFair value investments:\nCompany-sponsored investments $ 66,575,315 — — $ 66,575,315\nChanges to fair values of the investments are recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of income as investment\nincome (loss), net.\nNote 5 Line of Credit\nThe Company has a committed Line of Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a commercial bank that matures on\nDecember 12, 2024, which permits the Company to borrow up to $25.0 million. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear\ninterest at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.10%. The Company pays a commitment fee on the\nunused portion of the facility, accruing at a rate per annum of 0.10%.\nThe proceeds of the Credit Agreement may be used by the Company for ongoing working capital needs, to seed new and\nexisting investment strategies, and for other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement contains customary\nrepresentations, warranties, and covenants.\nThe Company did not borrow under the Credit Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and no\nborrowings were outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\nNote 6 Compensation Plans\nShare-Based Payment Transactions\nThe Company maintains the shareholder-approved Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. 2022 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan\n(the “2022 Plan”), which authorizes the issuance of 300,000 DHIL common shares in various forms of equity awards. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were 153,478 DHIL common shares available for grants under the 2022 Plan. Previously, the\nCompany issued equity awards under the Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. 2014 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the\n“2014 Plan”). There are no longer any DHIL common shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan, although certain\ngrants previously made under the 2014 Plan remain issued and outstanding.\nRestricted stock grants represent DHIL common shares issued and outstanding upon grant that remain subject to restrictions\nuntil specified vesting conditions are satisfied. The Company issues to all new employees upon hire restricted stock grants that\ncliff vest after five years of employment with the Company. After the end of each year, the Company also issues to certain key\nemployees restricted stock grants that vest ratably on an annual basis over three years.\n17\nTable of Contents\nRestricted stock grants are valued based upon the fair market value of the DHIL common shares on the applicable grant date.\nThe restricted stock grants are recorded as deferred compensation in the equity section of the balance sheet on the grant date\nand then recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the respective grant. The\nCompany’s policy is to adjust compensation expense for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe following table represents a roll-forward of outstanding restricted stock and related activity for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date Price\nShares per Share\nOutstanding restricted stock as of December 31, 2023 190,172 $ 164.69\nGrants issued 86,279 154.26\nGrants vested (73,706) 169.38\nGrants forfeited (7,125) 169.75\nTotal outstanding restricted stock as of September 30, 2024 195,620 $ 158.13\nTotal deferred equity compensation related to unvested restricted stock was $18.5 million as of September 30, 2024. The\nrecognition of compensation expense related to deferred compensation over the remaining vesting periods is as follows:\nThree Months\nRemaining In\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total\n$ 2,822,651 $ 8,202,433 $ 4,958,899 $ 1,635,028 $ 624,166 $ 278,038 $ 18,521,215\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), eligible employees may\npurchase DHIL common shares at 85% of the fair market value on the last day of each offering period. Each offering period is\napproximately three months, which generally coincides with the Company’s fiscal quarters. During the nine-month period\nended September 30, 2024, ESPP participants purchased 2,408 DHIL common shares for $0.3 million, and the Company\nrecorded $0.1 million of share-based payment expense related to the discount to fair market value for these purchases. During\nthe nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, ESPP participants purchased 2,659 DHIL common shares for $0.4 million\nand the Company recorded $0.1 million of share-based payment expense related to these purchases.\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) plan in which all employees are eligible to participate. Company employees may contribute a\nportion of their compensation subject to certain limits based on federal tax laws. The Company matches employee\ncontributions equal to 250.0% of the first 6.0% of an employee’s compensation contributed to the plan. The Company may\nsettle the 401(k) plan matching contributions in cash or DHIL common shares. Employees vest ratably in the matching\ncontributions over a five-year period.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nThe Company sponsors the Diamond Hill Fixed Term Deferred Compensation Plan and the Diamond Hill Variable Term\nDeferred Compensation Plan (together, the “Deferred Compensation Plans”). Under the Deferred Compensation Plans,\nparticipants may elect to voluntarily defer, for a minimum of five years (subject to an earlier distribution in the case of the\nparticipant’s death or disability or a change in control of DHIL), certain incentive compensation that the Company then\ncontributes into the Deferred Compensation Plans. Participants are responsible for designating investment options for the assets\nthey contribute, and the distribution paid to each participant reflects any gains or losses on the assets realized in connection with\nthe Deferred Compensation Plans. Assets held in the Deferred Compensation Plans are included in the Company’s investment\nportfolio, and the associated obligation to participants is included in deferred compensation liability. Deferred compensation\nliability was $38.9 million and $36.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n18\nTable of Contents\nNote 7 Operating Lease\nOn July 31, 2024, the Company entered into a 10-year extension of its lease through March 31, 2035, for office space of\napproximately 37,829 square feet at a single location.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the right-of-use asset, which is included in property and equipment on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, was approximately $3.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the lease\nliability was approximately $6.4 million.\nThe carrying value of the lease liability includes both principal and accrued interest on lease payments that are due in the\ncurrent and future periods. Lease liability is measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using\nthe discount rate determined at the lease commencement date. Interest expense on lease liability is recognized in the\nconsolidated income statements over the lease term.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the weighted average discount rate applied to the Company’s lease liability was 6.5%, reflective of\nthe Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate involves judgement,\nincluding assumptions about the Company’s credit risk, economic conditions, and the lease-specific circumstances such as lease\nterm and asset class. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of the Company’s lease\nliability.\nThe following table summarizes the total lease and operating expenses for the three-month and nine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nThree Months Ended $ 246,089 $ 234,336\nNine Months Ended $ 682,755 $ 674,749\nThe following table provides a maturity analysis of the Company’s operating lease liability, based on undiscounted cash flows,\nas of September 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n2024 $ 156,045\n2025 723,480\n2026 773,603\n2027 796,868\n2028 820,889\n2029 and Thereafter 5,715,394\nTotal undiscounted operating lease payments 8,986,279\nLess: Imputed interest (2,597,478)\nPresent value of operating lease liability $ 6,388,801\n19\nTable of Contents\nNote 8 Income Taxes\nThe Company has determined its interim tax provision projecting an estimated annual effective tax rate.\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nStatutory U.S. federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState and local income taxes, net of federal benefit 4.8 % 4.9 %\nInternal revenue code section 162 limitations 1.2 % 2.0 %\nOther — % 0.5 %\nUnconsolidated effective income tax rate 27.0 % 28.4 %\nImpact attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest(a) — % (0.6) %\nEffective income tax rate 27.0 % 27.8 %\n(a) The provision for income taxes includes the impact of the operations of the Consolidated Fund, which is not subject to federal income\ntaxes. Accordingly, a portion of the Company’s earnings are not subject to corporate tax levels.\nThe Company’s actual effective tax rate for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 could be materially different from the\nprojected rate as of September 30, 2024.\nThe net temporary differences incurred to date will reverse in future periods as the Company generates taxable earnings. The\nCompany believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to\nrealize the net deferred tax assets recorded. The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that\nsome portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no\nvaluation allowance was deemed necessary.\nFASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement\nrecognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return, and also provides guidance on de-\nrecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company\nrecognizes tax benefits related to positions taken, or expected to be taken, on its tax returns, only if the positions are “more-\nlikely-than-not” sustainable. Once this threshold has been met, the Company’s measurement of its expected tax benefits is\nrecognized in its financial statements. The Company did not record an accrual for tax-related uncertainties or unrecognized tax\npositions as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nThe Company did not recognize any interest and penalties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n20\nTable of Contents\nNote 9 Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted EPS are calculated under the two-class method and are computed by dividing net income attributable to\ncommon shareholders by the weighted average number of DHIL common shares outstanding for the period, including unvested\nrestricted shares. For the periods reported, DHIL did not have any dilutive common shares outstanding. DHIL has not issued\nany preferred shares. The following table sets forth the computation for basic and diluted EPS:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 14,644,593 $ 5,200,593 $ 35,786,366 $ 29,472,589\nLess: Net (income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling\ninterest — 1,272,839 — (859,126)\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 14,644,593 $ 6,473,432 $ 35,786,366 $ 28,613,463\nWeighted average number of outstanding shares - Basic 2,738,588 2,939,055 2,774,819 2,977,853\nWeighted average number of outstanding shares - Diluted 2,738,588 2,939,055 2,774,819 2,977,853\nEarnings per share attributable to common shareholders\nBasic $ 5.35 $ 2.20 $ 12.90 $ 9.61\nDiluted $ 5.35 $ 2.20 $ 12.90 $ 9.61\nNote 10 Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company indemnifies its directors, officers, and certain employees for certain liabilities that may arise from the\nperformance of their duties to the Company. From time to time, the Company may be involved in legal matters incidental to its\nbusiness. There are currently no such legal matters pending that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its\nconsolidated financial statements. However, litigation involves an element of uncertainty, and future developments could cause\nlegal actions or claims to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and/or\nliquidity.\nAdditionally, in the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that contain a variety of representations and\nwarranties and that provide indemnification obligations. Certain agreements do not contain any limits on the Company’s\nliability and could involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. Therefore, it is not\npossible to estimate the Company’s potential liability under these indemnities. Further, the Company maintains insurance\npolicies that may provide full or partial coverage against certain of these liabilities.\n21\nTable of Contents\nNote 11 Subsequent Events\nOn November 4, 2024, DHIL’s board of directors (“Board”) approved a quarterly cash dividend of $1.50 per share, payable on\nDecember 6, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 22, 2024. This dividend is expected to\nreduce shareholders’ equity by approximately $4.1 million.\n22\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-Q, the documents incorporated herein by reference and statements, whether oral or written, made from time to\ntime by representatives of the Company may contain or incorporate “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended (the “PSLR Act”), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nSuch statements are provided under the “safe harbor” protection of the PSLR Act. Forward-looking statements include, but are\nnot limited to, statements regarding anticipated operating results, prospects and levels of AUM or AUA, technological\ndevelopments, economic trends (including interest rates and market volatility), expected transactions and similar matters.

Similarly, descriptions of the Company’s objectives, strategies, plans, goals,\nor targets are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s expectations at the\ntime such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties\nand other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable,\ninvestors are cautioned that any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, accordingly, the Company’s actual results\nand experiences may differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in its forward-looking\nstatements.\nFactors that may cause the Company’s actual results or experiences to differ materially from results discussed in forward-\nlooking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) any reduction in the Company’s AUM or AUA; (ii) withdrawal,\nrenegotiation, or termination of investment advisory agreements; (iii) damage to the Company’s reputation; (iv) failure to\ncomply with investment guidelines or other contractual requirements; (v) challenges from the competition the Company faces\nin its business; (vi) challenges from industry trends towards lower fee strategies and model portfolio arrangements; (vii) adverse\nregulatory and legal developments; (viii) unfavorable changes in tax laws or limitations; (ix) interruptions in or failure to\nprovide critical technological service by the Company or third parties; (x) adverse civil litigation and government investigations\nor proceedings; (xi) failure to adapt to or successfully incorporate technological changes, such as artificial intelligence, into the\nCompany’s business; (xii) risk of loss on the Company’s investments; (xiii) lack of sufficient capital on satisfactory terms; (xiv)\nlosses or costs not covered by insurance; (xv) a decline in the performance of the Company’s products; (xvi) changes in interest\nrates and inflation; (xvii) changes in national and local economic and political conditions; (xviii) the continuing economic\nuncertainty in various parts of the world; (xix) the after-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in connection\ntherewith; (xx) political uncertainty caused by, among other things, political parties, economic nationalist sentiments, tensions\nsurrounding the current socioeconomic landscape; and (xxi) other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company’s public\ndocuments on file with the SEC.\nForward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their\nentirety by the cautionary statements above, in “Part I – Item 1A. – Risk Factors” of the 2023 Form 10-K, and in the\nCompany’s public documents on file with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and factors that the\nCompany currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the Company to predict these events or\nhow they may affect it. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they\nare made, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as required by law,\nalthough it may do so from time to time. Readers are advised to review this Form 10-Q in its entirety and consult any further\ndisclosures the Company makes on related subjects in its public announcements and SEC filings. The Company does not\nendorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\nGeneral\nThe Company derives its consolidated revenue and net income from investment advisory and fund administration services\nprovided by DHCM. DHCM is a registered investment adviser under the 1940 Act, and is the investment adviser and\nadministrator for the Funds. DHCM also provides investment advisory and related services to DHMF as well as separately\nmanaged accounts, CITs, other pooled vehicles including sub-advised funds, and model delivery programs.\nThe Company believes focusing on generating excellent, long-term investment outcomes and building enduring client\npartnerships will enable it to grow its intrinsic value to achieve a compelling, long-term return for its shareholders.\nThe Company accomplishes this through its shared investment principles, including: (i) valuation-disciplined active portfolio\nmanagement; (ii) fundamental bottom-up research; (iii) a long-term, business owner mindset; and (iv) a client alignment\nphilosophy that ensures clients’ interests come first. Client alignment is emphasized through: (i) a strategic capacity discipline\n23\nTable of Contents\nthat protects portfolio managers’ abilities to generate excess returns; (ii) personal investment by the Company’s portfolio\nmanagers in the strategies they manage; (iii) portfolio manager compensation being driven by long-term investment results in\nclient portfolios; and (iv) a fee philosophy focused on a fair sharing of the economics among clients, employees, and\nshareholders. The Company’s core cultural values of curiosity, ownership, trust, and respect create an environment where\ninvestment professionals focus on investment results and all teammates focus on the overall client experience.\nThe Company offers a variety of investment strategies designed for long-term strategic allocations from institutionally-oriented\ninvestors in key asset classes, aligning its investment team’s competitive advantages with its clients’ needs.\nAssets Under Management\nDHCM’s principal source of revenue is investment advisory fees earned from managing client accounts under investment\nadvisory and sub-advisory agreements. The fees earned depend on the type of investment strategy, account size, and servicing\nrequirements. DHCM’s revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of its AUM. Accordingly, net cash flows\nfrom clients, market fluctuations, and the composition of AUM impact the Company’s revenues and results of operations. The\nCompany also has certain agreements that allow it to earn performance-based fees if investment returns exceed targeted\namounts over a specified measurement period.\nModel Delivery Programs - Assets Under Advisement\nDHCM provides strategy-specific model portfolios to sponsors of model delivery programs. DHCM is paid for its services by\nthe program sponsors at a pre-determined rate based on AUA in the model delivery programs.

Refer to the information under the\nheading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation” within this “Part I – Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional discussion.\nThe Company expects that its operating profit margin will fluctuate period over period based on various factors, including\nrevenues, investment results in the strategies the Company manages, employee performance, staffing levels, and gains and\nlosses on investments held in the Deferred Compensation Plans.\nThe Company had $9.7 million in investment income due to market appreciation for the three months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to investment loss of $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nIncome tax expense increased $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in the Company’s income\nbefore taxes period over period.\nThe Company generated net income attributable to common shareholders of $14.6 million ($5.35 per diluted share) for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of $6.5 million ($2.20 per\ndiluted share) for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income attributable to common shareholders period over period\nwas primarily due to investment income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to investment losses\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 % Change\nInvestment advisory $ 37,230 $ 33,668 11 %\nMutual fund administration, net 1,788 1,886 (5) %\nTotal $ 39,018 $ 35,554 10 %\nInvestment Advisory Fees. Investment advisory fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $3.6 million,\nor 11%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Investment advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of\nthe market value of client accounts at contractual fee rates, which vary by investment product. The increase in investment\nadvisory fees was primarily due to an increase in total average AUM and AUA of 17%, partially offset by a decrease in the\naverage advisory fee rate from 0.48% to 0.46% period over period.\nThe average advisory fee rate for equity assets decreased from 0.51% during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to\n0.49% during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the average fee rate for fixed income assets increased from\n0.30% during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.31% during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The\ndecrease in the total average advisory fee rate was due to growth in the lower fee fixed income assets, which increased from\n11% of AUM and AUA during the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 16% during the three months ended September\n30, 2024. The average advisory fee rate is calculated by dividing investment advisory revenues by total average AUM and\nAUA during the period (annualized for all periods less than one year).\nMutual Fund Administration Fees. Mutual fund administration fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ndecreased by less than $0.1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Employee compensation and\nrelated costs (excluding deferred compensation expense (benefit)) increased by $1.7 million, or 9%, for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to separation payments\nof $0.9 million made during the 2024 period, an increase in accrued incentive compensation of $0.6 million, and an increase in\nsalary and related benefits of $0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in restricted stock expense of $0.3 million. Incentive\ncompensation expense can fluctuate significantly period over period as the Company evaluates investment performance,\nindividual performance, Company performance and other factors. Employee compensation and related costs (excluding\ndeferred compensation expense (benefit)) as a percentage of total revenue was 50% for both the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nDeferred Compensation Expense (Benefit). Deferred compensation expense was $2.3 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to a benefit of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to\nmarket returns on the Deferred Compensation Plans’ investments period over period.\nThe gain (loss) on the Deferred Compensation Plans’ investments increases (decreases) deferred compensation expense\n(benefit) and is included in operating income. Deferred compensation expense (benefit) is offset by an equal amount in\ninvestment income (loss) below net operating income on the consolidated statements of income, and thus, has no impact on net\nincome attributable to the Company.\nGeneral and Administrative.

Net cash\nprovided by operating activities of $11.6 million is inclusive of $9.8 million of cash used in operations by the Consolidated\nFunds.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe Company’s cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of purchases and redemptions in the Company’s\ninvestment portfolio and capital expenditures.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash flows used in\ninvesting activities were driven by purchases of Deferred Compensation Plan investments of $10.5 million and the purchase of\nproperty and equipment of $0.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of Deferred Compensation Plan investments\ntotaling $10.6 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows used in\ninvesting activities were driven by purchases of Deferred Compensation Plan investments of $6.6 million, which were partially\noffset by proceeds from the sale of Deferred Compensation Plan totaling $4.8 million. During the nine months ended September\n30, 2023, all purchases and sales of investments were in the Deferred Compensation Plans.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe Company’s cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of the repurchase of DHIL common shares, dividends\npaid on DHIL common shares, shares withheld related to employee tax withholding, proceeds received under the ESPP, and\ndistributions to, or contributions from, redeemable noncontrolling interest holders.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities totaled $38.4 million, consisting of cash\noutflows for repurchases of DHIL’s common shares of $21.7 million, the payment of quarterly dividends totaling $12.5 million,\nand the value of shares withheld to cover employee tax withholding obligations of $4.5 million. These cash outflows were\npartially offset by proceeds received under the ESPP of $0.3 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities totaled $27.2 million, consisting of cash\noutflows for repurchases of DHIL’s common stock of $19.6 million, the payment of quarterly dividends totaling $13.4 million,\nand the value of shares withheld to cover employee tax withholding obligations of $5.0 million. These cash outflows were\npartially offset by net subscriptions received in the Consolidated Funds from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders of\n$10.4 million and proceeds received under the ESPP of $0.4 million.\n33\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation\nAs supplemental information, the Company is providing certain financial measures that are based on methodologies other than\nGAAP (“non-GAAP”). Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures below are useful measures of the Company’s\ncore business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business, and help facilitate\ncomparisons to Company operating performance across periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for\nsupplemental informational purposes only, should not be used as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP and may be calculated differently from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The\nfollowing schedules reconcile the differences between financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and non-GAAP\nfinancial measures for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investors are\nencouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to\ntheir most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as the Company’s condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nEarnings\nper share\nTotal non- Net income attributable Net\nTotal Net operating attributable to common operating\n(in thousands, except percentages operating operating income Income tax to common shareholders profit\nand per share data) expenses income (loss) expense(4) shareholders - diluted margin\nGAAP Basis $ 28,801 $ 10,217 $ 9,669 $ 5,242 $ 14,645 $ 5.35 26 %\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nDeferred compensation liability(1) (2,250) 2,250 (2,250) — — — 6 %\nOther investment income(3) — — (7,419) (1,956) (5,463) (2.00) —\nAdjusted Non-GAAP basis $ 26,551 $ 12,467 $ — $ 3,286 $ 9,182 $ 3.35 32 %\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nEarnings per\nshare\nTotal non- Net income attributable Net\nTotal Net operating attributable to common operating\n(in thousands, except percentages operating operating income Income tax to common shareholders profit\nand per share data) expenses income (loss) expense(4) shareholders - diluted margin\nGAAP Basis $ 23,193 $ 12,361 $ (4,637) $ 2,524 $ 6,473 $ 2.20 35 %\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nDeferred compensation liability(1) 859 (859) 859 — — — (2) %\nConsolidated Fund(2) — 121 3,269 593 1,525 0.52 —\nOther investment income(3) — — 509 143 366 0.13 —\nAdjusted Non-GAAP basis $ 24,052 $ 11,623 $ — $ 3,260 $ 8,364 $ 2.85 33 %\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nEarnings per\nshare\nTotal non- Net income attributable Net\nTotal Net operating attributable to common operating\n(in thousands, except percentages operating operating income Income tax to common shareholders profit\nand per share data) expenses income (loss) expense(4) shareholders - diluted margin\nGAAP Basis $ 81,322 $ 30,653 $ 18,380 $ 13,247 $ 35,786 $ 12.90 27 %\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nDeferred compensation liability(1) (4,571) 4,571 (4,571) — — — 4 %\nOther investment income(3) — — (13,809) (3,731) (10,078) (3.64) —\nAdjusted Non-GAAP basis $ 76,751 $ 35,224 $ — $ 9,516 $ 25,708 $ 9.26 31 %\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nEarnings per\nshare\nTotal non- Net income attributable Net\nTotal Net operating attributable to common operating\n(in thousands, except percentages operating operating income Income tax to common shareholders profit\nand per share data) expenses income (loss) expense(4) shareholders - diluted margin\nGAAP Basis $ 71,806 $ 31,089 $ 9,722 $ 11,339 $ 28,613 $ 9.61 30 %\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nDeferred compensation liability (1) (1,868) 1,868 (1,868) — — — 2 %\nConsolidated Fund(2) — 330 (4,148) (840) (2,119) (0.71) —\nOther investment income(3) — — (3,706) (1,053) (2,653) (0.89) —\nAdjusted Non-GAAP basis $ 69,938 $ 33,287 $ — $ 9,446 $ 23,841 $ 8.01 32 %\n35\nTable of Contents\n(1) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense resulting from market valuation changes in the Deferred\nCompensation Plans’ liability and the related net gains/losses on investments designated as an economic hedge against the\nrelated liability. Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plans are adjusted for appreciation/depreciation of\ninvestments chosen by participants. The Company believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income or loss\nrealized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help readers understand the\nCompany’s core operating results and to improve comparability from period to period.\n(2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact that the Consolidated Fund has on the Company’s GAAP consolidated\nstatements of income. Specifically, the Company adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the\nConsolidated Fund. The adjustment to net operating income represents the operating expenses of the Consolidated Fund, net of\nthe elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to common\nshareholders represents the net income of the Consolidated Fund, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company\nbelieves removing the impact of the Consolidated Fund helps readers understand its core operating results and improves\ncomparability from period to period.\n(3) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the net gains or losses earned on the Company’s non-consolidated investment\nportfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the Deferred Compensation Plans’ liability, non-consolidated seed\ninvestments, and other investments. The Company believes adjusting for these non-operating income or loss items helps\nreaders understand the Company’s core operating results and improves comparability from period to period.\n(4) The income tax expense impacts were calculated and resulted in the overall non-GAAP effective tax rates of 26.4% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, 28.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, 27.0% for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, and 28.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The\npreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates,\njudgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates such estimates, judgments, and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and\nbases its estimates, judgements, and assumptions on historical experiences, current trends, and various other factors that\nmanagement believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the estimate was made. By their nature, these\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFor a summary of the critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements,\nplease see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in “Part I - Item 1 - Financial Statements” of this Form 10-Q, and Note\n2, Significant Accounting Policies, in “Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates during the quarter ended September 30,\n2024, as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in “Part II - Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nFor information regarding the Company’s exposure to certain market risks, see “Part II - Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk” in the 2023 Form 10-K. Except as described in “Part I - Item 2 - Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-Q, there have been no significant changes in\nthe Company’s market risk exposures since the Company’s December 31, 2023 year end.\nITEM 4: Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on such evaluation, the\nChief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\n36\nTable of Contents\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including\nthe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company’s\nmanagement recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance, not absolute, of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance,\nthe Company’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npossible controls and procedures. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company’s controls and procedures will detect\nall errors or fraud.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.\nPART II: OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1: Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to ordinary, routine litigation that is incidental to its business. There are currently no\nsuch matters pending that the Company believes could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nITEM 1A: Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors from the information disclosed in “Part I - Item 1A - Risk\nFactors” of the 2023 Form 10-K.\nITEM 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, DHIL did not sell any common shares that were not registered under the\nSecurities Act. The following table sets forth information regarding repurchases of DHIL common shares during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024:\nTotal Number\nof Common Approximate\nShares Dollar Value of\nPurchased Shares that May\nTotal Number of Average Price as part of Publicly Yet Be Purchased\nCommon Shares Paid Per Common Announced Plans Under the Plans or\nPeriod Purchased (a) Share or Programs(b) Programs(b)\nJuly 1, 2024 through\nJuly 31, 2024 308 $ 140.75 — $ 8,077,166\nAugust. 1, 2024 through\nAugust 31, 2024 22,367 149.17 22,367 4,740,602\nSeptember. 1, 2024 through\nSeptember 30, 2024 9 149.11 9 4,739,260\nTotal 22,684 $ 149.06 22,376 $ 4,739,260\n(a) The Company regularly withholds common shares for tax payments due upon the vesting of employee restricted stock.\nCommon shares withheld to cover tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of employee restricted stock\nare treated as common share repurchases for purposes of this table. The common shares withheld are not considered\nrepurchases of DHIL common shares under any authorized common share repurchase plan or program. During the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, the Company withheld 308 DHIL common shares for employee tax withholding obligations at\nan average price paid per share of $140.75.\n(b) On May 10, 2023, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to $50.0 million of DHIL common shares (the\n“2023 Repurchase Program”). On November 4, 2024, the Board terminated the 2023 Repurchase Program and approved a\n37\nTable of Contents\nnew repurchase plan, authorizing management to repurchase up to $50 million DHIL common shares in the open market\nand in private transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws (the “2024 Repurchase Program”). The 2024\nRepurchase Program will expire on November 4, 2026, or upon the earlier completion of all authorized purchases under the\nprogram.\nIn connection with the 2024 Repurchase Program, DHIL entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. The Rule 10b5-1 trading plan\nis intended to qualify for the safe harbor under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. A Rule 10b5-1 trading plan allows a\ncompany to purchase its stock at times when it would not ordinarily be in the market because of its trading policies or the\npossession of material nonpublic information. Because repurchases under DHIL’s Rule 10b5-1 trading plan are subject to\nspecified parameters and certain price, timing, and volume restraints specified in the plan, there is no guarantee as to the exact\nnumber of common shares that will be repurchased or that there will be any repurchases at all pursuant to the plan. Purchases\nunder the 2024 Repurchase Program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Purchases\nin the open market are intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.\nITEM 3: Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nITEM 4: Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5: Other Information\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or Section 16 officer (as defined under Rule 16a-1 of the Exchange\nAct) adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (in each case, as\ndefined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).\n38\nTable of Contents\nITEM 6: Exhibits\n3.1 Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of DHIL (incorporated by reference from Exhibit 3.1 to the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024).\n3.2 Amended and Restated Code of Regulations of DHIL (incorporated by reference from Exhibit 3.2 to the\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 28, 2017).\n31.1 Certification of Chief Executive Officer required by Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a) (filed herewith).\n31.2 Certification of Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a) (filed herewith).\n32.1 Section 1350 Certification (filed herewith).\n101.INS XBRL Instance Document - the instance document does not appear in the Interactive Data File because its\nXBRL tags are embedded within the Inline XBRL document.\n101.SCH XBRL Taxonomy Extension Schema Document.\n101.CAL XBRL Taxonomy Extension Calculation Linkbase Document.\n101.DEF XBRL Taxonomy Definition Linkbase Document.\n101.LAB XBRL Taxonomy Extension Label Linkbase Document.\n101.PRE XBRL Taxonomy Extension Presentation Linkbase Document.\n104 Cover Page Interactive Data File (embedded within the Inline XBRL document and included in Exhibit 101).\n39\nTable of Contents\nDIAMOND HILL INVESTMENT GROUP, INC.\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on\nits behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.\nDIAMOND HILL INVESTMENT GROUP, INC.\nDate Title Signature\nNovember 4, Chief Executive Officer and President (Principal Executive\n2024 Officer) /s/ Heather E.

Such statements are provided under the “safe harbor” protection of the PSLR Act.\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding anticipated operating results, prospects and levels of assets under\nmanagement, technological developments, economic trends (including interest rates and market volatility), expected transactions and similar matters. The\nwords “may,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “target,” “goal,” “project,” “estimate,” “guidance,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “would,” “will,” “continue,” “likely,”\n“should,” “hope,” “seek,” “plan,” “intend,” and variations of such words and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. Similarly,\ndescriptions of the Company’s objectives, strategies, plans, goals, or targets are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our\nexpectations at the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties and other\nfactors. While the Company believes that the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that any of the\nassumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, accordingly, the Company's actual results and experiences may differ materially from the anticipated results or\nother expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements.\nFactors that may cause such actual results or experiences to differ materially from results discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) any reduction in the Company's assets under management (“AUM”) or assets under advisement (“AUA”); (ii) withdrawal, renegotiation, or\ntermination of investment advisory agreements; (iii) damage to the Company's reputation; (iv) failure to comply with investment guidelines or other contractual\nrequirements; (v) challenges from the competition the Company faces in its business; (vi) challenges from industry trends towards lower fee strategies and\nmodel portfolio arrangements; (vii) adverse regulatory and legal developments; (viii) unfavorable changes in tax laws or limitations; (ix) interruptions in or\nfailure to provide critical technological service by the Company or third parties; (x) adverse civil litigation and government investigations or proceedings; (xi)\nfailure to adapt to or successfully incorporate technological changes, such as artificial intelligence, into the Company’s business; (xii) risk of loss on the\nCompany's investments; (xiii) lack of sufficient capital on satisfactory terms; (xiv) losses or costs not covered by insurance; (xv) a decline in the performance\nof the Company's products; (xvi) changes in interest rates and inflation; (xvii) changes in national and local economic and political conditions; (xix) the\ncontinuing economic uncertainty in various parts of the world; (xviii) the after-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in connection\ntherewith; (xx) political uncertainty caused by, among other things, political parties, economic nationalist sentiments, tensions surrounding the current\nsocioeconomic landscape; and (xix), other risks identified from time-to-time in our public documents on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”), including those discussed in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nForward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements\nabove, in Item 1A of this Form 10-K, and in our other public documents on file with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and factors\nthat the Company currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the Company to predict these events or how they may affect it.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future\nevents or developments, except as required by federal securities laws, although it may do so from time to time. Readers are advised to consult any further\ndisclosures the Company makes on related subjects in its public announcements and SEC filings. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding\nfuture performance that may be made by third parties.\n3\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nDHIL derives its consolidated revenue and net income from investment advisory and fund administration services provided by its wholly owned subsidiary,\nDiamond Hill Capital Management, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“DHCM”). DHCM is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and is the investment adviser and administrator for the Diamond Hill Funds, a series of open-end mutual funds (each a\n“Fund,” and collectively, the “Funds”). DHCM also provides investment advisory and related services to the Diamond Hill Micro Cap Fund, LP (“DHMF”), a\nprivate fund, as well as, separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts (“CITs”), other pooled vehicles including sub-advised funds, and model\ndelivery programs.\nThe Company believes focusing on generating excellent, long-term investment outcomes and building enduring client partnerships will enable it to grow its\nintrinsic value to achieve a compelling, long-term return for its shareholders.\nThe Company accomplishes this through its shared investment principles, including: (i) valuation-disciplined active portfolio management, (ii) fundamental\nbottom-up research, (iii) a long-term, business-owner mindset, and (iv) a client alignment philosophy that ensures clients’ interests come first. Client alignment\nis emphasized through: (i) a strategic capacity discipline that protects portfolio managers’ abilities to generate excess returns, (ii) personal investment by\nportfolio managers in the strategies they manage, (iii) portfolio manager compensation being driven by long-term investment results in client portfolios, and\n(iv) a fee philosophy focused on a fair sharing of the economics among clients, employees, and shareholders. The Company’s core cultural values of curiosity,\nownership, trust, and respect create an environment where investment professionals focus on investment results and all teammates focus on the overall client\nexperience.\nThe Company offers a variety of investment strategies designed for long-term strategic allocations from institutionally oriented investors in key asset classes,\naligning its investment team’s competitive advantages with its clients’ needs.\nAssets Under Management\nDHCM’s principal source of revenue is investment advisory fee income earned from managing client accounts under investment advisory and sub-advisory\nagreements. The fees earned depend on the type of investment strategy, account size, and servicing requirements. DHCM’s revenues depend largely on the total\nvalue and composition of its AUM. Accordingly, net cash flows from clients, market fluctuations, and the composition of AUM impact the Company’s\nrevenues and results of operations. DHCM also has certain agreements that allow it to earn performance-based fees if investment returns exceed targeted\namounts over a specified measurement period.\nModel Delivery Programs - Assets Under Advisement\nDHCM provides strategy-specific model portfolios to sponsors of model delivery programs. DHCM is paid for its services by the program sponsors at a pre-\ndetermined rate based on AUA in the model delivery programs. DHCM does not have discretionary investment authority over individual client accounts in the\nmodel delivery programs, and therefore, the AUA is not included in the Company’s AUM.\nThe Company’s revenues are highly dependent on both the value and composition of AUM and AUA. The following is a summary of the Company’s AUM by\nproduct and investment strategy, a roll-forward of the change in AUM, and a summary of AUA for each of the past five years ended December 31, 2023:\nAssets Under Management and Assets Under Advisement\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\nDiamond Hill Funds $ 15,879 $ 14,745 $ 19,786 $ 17,615 $ 16,148\nSeparately managed accounts 6,617 6,220 7,232 5,611 5,222\nCollective investment trusts 1,359 1,040 603 318 30\nOther pooled vehicles 3,563 2,758 3,407 2,867 1,999\nTotal AUM 27,418 24,763 31,028 26,411 23,399\nTotal AUA 1,746 1,802 2,098 1,099 933\nTotal AUM and AUA $ 29,164 $ 26,565 $ 33,126 $ 27,510 $ 24,332\n4\nTable of Contents\nAssets Under Management\nby Investment Strategy\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\nU.S. Equity\nLarge Cap $ 17,307 $ 16,478 $ 21,285 $ 15,075 $ 12,316\nSmall-Mid Cap 2,588 2,646 3,183 2,810 3,243\nMid Cap 1,023 899 1,165 992 569\nSelect 593 392 438 446 528\nSmall Cap 255 306 597 556 795\nLarge Cap Concentrated 98 99 64 27 28\nMicro Cap 21 15 16 — —\nTotal U.S. Equity 21,885 20,835 26,748 19,906 17,479\nAlternatives\nLong-Short 1,725 1,752 1,998 2,056 3,605\nTotal Alternatives 1,725 1,752 1,998 2,056 3,605\nGlobal/International Equity\nInternational 109 52 56 17 13\nGlobal(a) — — — 16 22\nTotal Global/International Equity 109 52 56 33 35\nFixed Income\nShort Duration Securitized Bond 1,948 1,308 1,613 1,132 809\nCore Fixed Income 1,735 792 622 541 300\nLong Duration Treasury 26 33 51 62 52\nCorporate Credit(b) — — — 2,020 1,147\nHigh Yield(b) — — — 724 135\nTotal Fixed Income 3,709 2,133 2,286 4,479 2,443\nTotal-All Strategies 27,428 24,772 31,088 26,474 23,562\n(Less: Investments in affiliated funds)(c) (10) (9) (60) (63) (163)\nTotal AUM 27,418 24,763 31,028 26,411 23,399\nTotal AUA(d) 1,746 1,802 2,098 1,099 933\nTotal AUM and AUA $ 29,164 $ 26,565 $ 33,126 $ 27,510 $ 24,332\n(a) The Diamond Hill Global Fund was liquidated on December 17, 2021.\n(b) The Diamond Hill Corporate Credit and the Diamond Hill High Yield investment advisory contracts (the “High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts”) were sold to\nBrandywine Global Investment Management, LLC (“Brandywine Global”) effective July 30, 2021.\n(c) Certain of the Funds own shares of the Diamond Hill Short Duration Securitized Bond Fund.

If the Company determines the size of a strategy could impede its ability to meet investment return goals, the\nCompany will close that strategy to new clients. The Company’s commitment to capacity discipline inherently impacts its ability to grow its AUM. Investment\nresults will always be prioritized over asset accumulation.\nThe Company’s capacity as of December 31, 2023 was estimated to be $40 billion to $50 billion in domestic equities, $20 billion to $30 billion in international\nequities, and $50 billion to $65 billion in fixed income. The Company’s firm-level capacity increases with the development of new products or strategies.\nGrowth Strategy\nThe Company’s growth centers first and foremost on delivering an investment and client experience that enables investors to experience better outcomes over\nthe long-term. The Company’s client alignment philosophy guides it to develop strategies and offer vehicles that meet clients’ objectives, capitalize on its\ninvestment team’s research capabilities, and align with its investment principles.\nThe Company looks to attract like-minded, long-term focused clients across all of its offerings. To ensure efficient business development and relationship\nmanagement, the Company has dedicated resources toward content-led marketing and sales enablement efforts. The Company believes that the combination of\nthese efforts will lead to a deeper understanding of its investment strategies, and ultimately, longer holding periods for investors.\nThe Company focuses its efforts primarily on asset allocators with centralized research teams, allowing efficient delivery of services to a larger and more\ndiverse client base. These highly sophisticated buyers conduct deep research and pair the Company’s strategies with complementary strategies to meet holistic\nclient objectives. These asset allocators include centralized research teams at institutional consulting firms, wirehouses, banks, independent broker dealers, and\nindependent registered investment advisory firms. The Company aims to partner with investors who maintain a long-term orientation and align with its\ninvestment principles.\n6\nTable of Contents\nDistribution Channels\nThe Company offers a variety of investment strategies designed for long-term strategic allocations from institutionally-oriented investors in key asset classes,\naligning its investment team’s competitive advantages with its clients’ needs. The following table is a summary of AUM by distribution channel for each of the\nfive years ended December 31, 2023:\nAUM and AUA by Distribution Channel\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\nDiamond Hill Funds:\nRegistered investment adviser $ 4,329 $ 3,787 $ 4,633 $ 4,315 $ 3,603\nIndependent broker-dealer 4,597 4,135 5,304 4,274 3,563\nWirehouse 2,902 2,843 4,195 3,529 3,026\nBank trust 1,777 1,718 2,256 2,546 2,907\nDefined contribution 2,090 2,085 3,249 2,716 2,723\nOther 184 177 149 235 326\nTotal Diamond Hill Funds 15,879 14,745 19,786 17,615 16,148\nSeparately managed accounts:\nInstitutional consultant 2,782 2,432 2,960 2,504 2,397\nFinancial intermediary 2,986 3,067 3,594 2,371 1,777\nDirect 849 721 678 736 1,048\nTotal separately managed accounts 6,617 6,220 7,232 5,611 5,222\nCollective investment trusts 1,359 1,040 603 318 30\nOther pooled vehicles 3,563 2,758 3,407 2,867 1,999\nTotal AUM 27,418 24,763 31,028 26,411 23,399\nTotal AUA(a) 1,746 1,802 2,098 1,099 933\nTotal AUM and AUA $ 29,164 $ 26,565 $ 33,126 $ 27,510 $ 24,332\n(a) 100% of AUA is from financial intermediaries.\nFund Administration Activities\nDHCM provides fund administration services to the Funds. Fund administration services are broadly defined to include the following services: portfolio and\nregulatory compliance; treasury and financial oversight; oversight of back-office service providers, such as the custodian, fund accountant, and transfer agent;\nand general business management and governance of the Funds.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the investment management industry is intense, and DHCM’s competitors include investment management firms, broker-dealers, banks, and\ninsurance companies, some of whom offer various investment alternatives, including passive index strategies. Many of DHCM’s competitors are better known,\noffer a broader range of investment products, and have more dedicated resources for business development and marketing.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRegulation\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state, and non-U.S. laws and regulations. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies are charged with\nsafeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets, and with protecting the interests of participants in those markets, including investment\nadvisory clients and shareholders of investment funds. If an adviser fails to comply with these laws and regulations, these regulatory bodies have broad\nadministrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict, or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business. Possible sanctions that regulatory\nbodies may impose include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified\nperiods of time, revocation of investment adviser, broker-dealer, and other registrations, censures, and fines.\nDHCM is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and operates in a highly regulated environment. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on\nregistered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements, and disclosure obligations. All of the Funds\nare registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), and are required to make notice filings with all states where\nthe Funds are offered for sale. Virtually all aspects of DHCM’s investment advisory and fund administration business are subject to various federal and state\nlaws and regulations.\nDHCM is a “fiduciary” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), with respect to benefit plan clients, and\ntherefore, is subject to ERISA regulations. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, impose certain duties on\npersons who are fiduciaries, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients, and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The\nDepartment of Labor, which administers ERISA, has been increasingly active in proposing and adopting regulations affecting the asset management industry.\nDHCM’s trading activities for client accounts are regulated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, which includes regulations governing trading on inside\ninformation, market manipulation, and a broad number of trading and market regulation requirements in the United States.\nThe preceding descriptions of the regulatory and statutory provisions applicable to DHCM are not exhaustive or complete and are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to the respective statutory or regulatory provisions. Failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on DHCM’s\nbusiness.\nContractual Relationships with the Funds\nDHCM is highly dependent on its contractual relationships with the Funds. If any of DHCM’s advisory or administration agreements with the Funds were\nterminated or not renewed, or were amended or modified to reduce fees, DHCM would be materially and adversely affected. DHCM generated approximately\n68%, 71%, and 69% of its 2023, 2022, and 2021 revenues, respectively, from its advisory and administration agreements with the Funds. DHCM believes that\nit has strong relationships with the Funds and their board of trustees, and DHCM has no reason to believe that these advisory or administration contracts will\nnot be renewed in the future. However, there is no assurance that the Funds will choose to continue their relationships with DHCM. Please see Item 1A for risk\nfactors regarding this relationship.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes its people are its greatest asset, and each role within the firm contributes to its goals of generating excellent, long-term investment\noutcomes and building enduring client partnerships.\nWorkforce Data\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talented employees is integral to the Company’s human capital strategy and critical to its success. The Company depends\non highly skilled personnel, with specialized expertise and extensive experience in the investment management industry. As of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company employed 129 full-time employees.\nThe average employee tenure is approximately eight years, and nearly one-third of its employees have been with the Company more than 10 years. The\nCompany’s five-year average employee turnover rate is approximately 7%. The Company’s employees are based in 12 states, and approximately 80% of its\nemployees reside in Ohio.\n8\nTable of Contents\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits\nThe Company’s competitive compensation and benefits are designed to help attract, retain, and motivate employees who embody its values. The Company\naligns its employees’ compensation with client outcomes, individual and team results, and company performance.\nCulture\nThe Company’s culture emphasizes four key values: curiosity, ownership, trust and respect. The way its employees embody these core values creates the\nCompany’s culture. The culture allows the Company to attract and retain employees who share its commitment to client alignment, are motivated by\ninvestment excellence, and are committed to delivering excellent outcomes.\nEmployees who are curious focus on continuous self-improvement and have a passion for learning. They are open-minded, seek differing perspectives, and go\nbeyond surface-level assumptions. Employees who think and act like business owners naturally embrace a long-term mindset. They lead by example and accept\naccountability for ensuring strong client outcomes. Employees who embrace trust act with integrity, are authentic and honest in interactions with others, and\nput client interests ahead of all others. Employees who are motivated by giving and receiving respect communicate and provide feedback candidly,\ntransparently, and with positive intent. They are humble in their assumptions and listen to better understand others. They embrace, value, and celebrate\ndiversity, inclusion, and differences in all forms.\nThe Company’s culture revolves around the fact that DHCM is a fiduciary first and foremost. The primary focus is serving its clients. The Company’s long-\nterm, valuation-disciplined investment principles are foundational to its culture and have been consistently implemented since the firm’s inception. All\nmembers of the investment team believe in, and adhere to, the same investment principles. The Company’s employees invest alongside its clients, and portfolio\nmanagers have significant personal investments in the strategy or strategies they manage.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nThe Company views diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) as essential parts of its business and operating model. DEI is embedded in the policies, practices,\nand strategic initiatives of the Company, and is linked to its core values. The Company believes clients are best served by decision making that engages and\nencourages varied perspectives.\nAs of December 31, 2023, females represented 50% of DHIL’s board of directors (“Board”), 66% of the Company’s management team, and approximately\n32% of its employees. As of December 31, 2023, racial or ethnic minorities represented approximately 14% of the Company’s workforce and 17% of the\nBoard. Please see additional demographic details on the Company’s website.\nDEI is a continuous journey, and the Company recognizes that transparency and accountability are critical to driving real change within the firm, in the\nindustry, and within its community. Learn more about the Company’s DEI philosophy, commitments and annual progress on the Company’s website. The\ninformation on our website, including our DEI annual reports, is not incorporated by reference in or otherwise considered a part of this Form 10-K or any other\nreport or document we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. The Company’s DEI initiatives are driven by employees across functional teams who are enthusiastic\nabout leading sustainable efforts under four areas of focus: workforce diversity, inclusive culture, vendor and policy, and philanthropy and community.\nSEC Filings\nThe Company maintains a website at www.diamond-hill.com. The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current\nReports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports that it files or furnishes from time-to-time pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are\nmade available free of charge, on or through the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is\nelectronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Risk Factors\nThe Company’s future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources as well as the market price of its common shares, are subject\nto various risks, including those risks mentioned below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K as well as those risks that are discussed from time-to-time in the\nCompany’s other filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider these risks before making an investment decision regarding the Company’s\nsecurities. There may be additional risks of which the Company is currently unaware, or which the Company currently considers to be immaterial. The\noccurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources\nand the value of its securities. Please see “Forward Looking Statements” within Part I, Item 1, of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Risks\nPoor investment results or adverse ratings of the Company’s products could affect its ability to attract new clients or could reduce its AUM, potentially\nnegatively impacting revenue and net income.\nIf the Company fails to deliver acceptable investment results for its clients, both in the short and long-term, the Company could experience diminished investor\ninterest and a decreased level of AUM.\nInvestment strategies are assessed and rated by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts, and publications. Investors can be\ninfluenced by such ratings. If a strategy receives an adverse report, it could negatively impact the Company’s AUM and revenue.\nThe Company’s success depends on its key personnel, and its financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.\nThe Company’s success depends on highly skilled personnel, including portfolio managers, research analysts, and management, many of whom have\nspecialized expertise and extensive experience in the investment management industry. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and the Company\nfaces significant competition for qualified employees. Other than the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, its employees do not have employment contracts and\ngenerally can terminate their employment at any time. The Company may not be able to retain or replace key personnel. To retain or replace its key personnel,\nthe Company may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease its net income. The loss of key personnel could damage the Company’s\nreputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and clients. A loss of client assets resulting from the departure of key personnel may\nmaterially decrease the Company’s revenues and net income. Specifically, Charles Bath, a co-portfolio manager on our Large Cap strategy, which is our largest\nstrategy by AUM and revenues, announced his retirement from the Company effective December 31, 2024. It is possible his departure could lead to increased\nredemptions resulting in a material decline in AUM and revenue. The Company has had a well-defined succession plan in place since 2018, when Austin\nHawley was named co-portfolio manager on the Large Cap strategy. Mr. Hawley has worked closely with Mr. Bath for over 15 years, including the last six\nyears as a co-portfolio manager.\nThe Company’s investment results and/or growth in its AUM may be constrained if appropriate investment opportunities are not available or if the Company\ncloses certain of its investment strategies to new investors.\nThe Company’s ability to deliver excellent investment results depends in large part on its ability to identify appropriate investment opportunities in which to\ninvest client assets. If the Company is unable to identify sufficient investment opportunities for existing and new client assets on a timely basis, its investment\nresults could be adversely affected. The risk that appropriate investment opportunities may be unavailable is influenced by a number of factors, including\ngeneral market conditions, and is likely to increase if the Company’s AUM increases rapidly. The Company’s efforts to establish and develop new strategies\nmay face challenges or ultimately be unsuccessful, which could impact its results of operations, reputation, and/or culture. In addition, if the Company\ndetermines that sufficient investment opportunities are not available for an investment strategy, or it believes that it is necessary to continue to produce\nattractive returns from an investment strategy, the Company will consider closing the investment strategy to new investors. If the Company misjudged the point\nat which it would be optimal to close an investment strategy, the investment results of the strategy could be negatively impacted. The Company has closed\ninvestment strategies in the past and may do so again in the future. As of December 31, 2023, the Company does not have any closed investment strategies.\nThe Company is subject to substantial competition in all aspects of its business.\nThe Company’s investment products compete against investment products and services from:\n• Asset management firms;\n10\nTable of Contents\n• Mutual fund companies;\n• Commercial banks and thrift institutions;\n• Insurance companies;\n• Exchange-traded funds;\n• Private funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds; and\n• Brokerage and investment banking firms.\nMany of the Company’s competitors have substantially greater resources and may operate in more markets or offer a broader range of products, including\npassively managed or “index” products. Some of these institutions operate in a different regulatory environment, which may give them certain competitive\nadvantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. The Company competes with other providers of investment services primarily\nbased upon its philosophy, performance, and client service. Some institutions have a broader array of products and distribution channels, which makes it\nmore difficult for the Company to compete. If current or potential clients decide to use one of the Company’s competitors, it could face a significant decline\nin market share, AUM, AUA, revenues, and net income. If the Company is required to lower its fees to remain competitive, its net income could be\nsignificantly reduced because some of the Company’s expenses are fixed, especially over shorter periods of time, and its expenses may not decrease in\nproportion to the decrease in revenues. Additionally, over the past several years, investors have generally shown a preference for passive investment products\nover actively managed strategies. If this trend continues, the Company’s AUM, revenues, and net income may be negatively impacted.\nIndustry trends towards lower fee strategies and model portfolio arrangements could adversely impact the Company’s revenues.\nMarket and competitive pressures in recent years have created a trend towards lower management fees in the asset management industry and there can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to maintain its current fee structure. As a result, a shift in in the Company’s AUM from higher to lower fee\ngenerating clients and strategies could result in a decrease in profitability even if its AUM increases or remains unchanged. Similarly, in recent years, there\nhas been a trend in clients shifting their assets from higher fee mutual funds and separately managed accounts to lower fee model portfolio arrangements. As\na result, a shift in the Company’s client assets from AUM to AUA could result in a decrease in Company revenues.\nThe loss of access to, or increased fees required by, third-party distribution sources to market the Company’s portfolios and access its client base could\nadversely affect the Company’s results of operations.\nThe Company’s ability to attract additional AUM is dependent on its relationship with third-party financial intermediaries. The Company compensates some of\nthese intermediaries for access to investors and for various marketing services provided. These distribution sources and client bases may not continue to be\naccessible to the Company for reasonable terms, or at all. If such access is restricted or eliminated, it could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of\noperations. Fees paid to financial intermediaries for investor access and marketing services have generally increased in recent years. If such fee increases\ncontinue, refusal to pay them could restrict the Company’s access to those client bases while paying them could adversely affect its profitability.\nA significant portion of DHCM's revenues are based on advisory and administration agreements with the Funds that are subject to termination without cause\nand on short notice.\nDHCM is highly dependent on its contractual relationships with the Funds. If DHCM’s advisory or administration agreements with the Funds were terminated\nor not renewed, or were amended or modified to reduce fees, DHCM would be materially and adversely affected. Generally, these agreements are terminable\nby either party upon 60 days’ prior written notice without penalty. The Funds’ agreements are subject to annual approval by either: (i) their board of trustees, or\n(ii) a vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Fund. These agreements automatically terminate in the event of their assignment by either\nDHCM or the Funds. DHCM generated approximately 68%, 71%, and 69% of its 2023, 2022, and 2021 revenues, respectively, from its advisory and\nadministration agreements with the Funds, including 30%, 12%, and 10% from the advisory contracts with the Diamond Hill Large Cap Fund, the Diamond\nHill Long-Short Fund, and the Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap Fund, respectively, during 2023. The loss of any of the Diamond Hill Large Cap Fund, the\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund, or the Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap Fund contracts would have a material adverse effect on DHCM. DHCM believes that it\nhas strong relationships with the Funds and their board of trustees, and it has no reason to believe that these advisory or administration contracts will not be\nrenewed in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the Funds will choose to continue their relationships with DHCM.\n11\nTable of Contents\nNegative public opinion of the Company could cause it to lose clients and adversely affect its share price.\nNegative public opinion can result from the Company’s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including trading practices, corporate governance\nand acquisitions, DEI issues, social media and other marketing activities, and actions taken by governmental regulators and community organizations in\nresponse to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could adversely affect the Company’s ability to attract and maintain clients, could expose the\nCompany to potential litigation or regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on its share price or result in heightened volatility.\nOperational Risks\nCybersecurity attacks could prevent the Company from managing client portfolios, cause the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or\nemployee information or result in misappropriation of information or funds, each of which could severely harm its business.\nAs part of its business, the Company collects, processes, and transmits sensitive and confidential information about its clients and employees, as well as\nproprietary information about its business. The Company has policies and procedures pursuant to which it takes numerous security measures to prevent\ncyberattacks of various kinds as well as fraudulent and inadvertent activity by persons who have been granted access to such sensitive or confidential\ninformation. Nevertheless, the Company’s systems, like all technology systems, remain vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can result in theft or\ncorruption of information. In addition, the Company shares information with third party vendors upon whom it relies for various functions. The systems of such\nthird parties also are vulnerable to cyber threats. Unauthorized access can come from unrelated third parties through the internet, from access to hardware\nremoved from the Company’s or those third parties’ premises, or from employees acting intentionally or inadvertently.\nCybersecurity incidents can involve, among other things: (i) deliberate attacks designed to corrupt the Company’s information systems and make them\nunusable by the Company to operate its business; (ii) theft of information used by the perpetrators for financial and other gain; or (iii) inadvertent releases of\ninformation by employees or third parties with whom the Company does business.\nCyberattacks that corrupt the Company’s information systems and make them unusable could impair its ability to trade securities in its clients’ accounts.\nCorruption of the systems of the Company’s third-party vendors could impact the Company to the same extent as corruption of its own systems. If information\nabout the Company’s employees or clients is intentionally stolen or inadvertently made public, that information could be used to commit identity theft, obtain\ncredit in an employee’s or client’s name, or steal from an employee or client. If information about the Company’s business is obtained by unauthorized persons,\nwhether through intentional attacks or inadvertent releases of information, it could be used to harm its competitive position.\nWhether information is corrupted, stolen, or inadvertently disclosed, and regardless of the type and nature of the information (e.g., proprietary information\nabout the Company’s business or personal information about clients or employees), it could have various adverse impacts on, and be materially harmful to, the\nCompany, including the following:\n• The Company’s reputation could be harmed, resulting in the loss of clients, vendors, and employees or making payments or concessions to such\npersons to maintain its relationships with them;\n• The Company’s inability to operate its business fully, even if temporarily, and thus, fulfill contracts with clients or vendors, could result in termination\nof contracts and loss of revenue;\n• Harm suffered by clients or vendors whose contracts have been breached, or by clients, vendors, or employees whose information is compromised,\ncould result in costly litigation against us;\n• The Company’s need to focus attention on remediation of a cybersecurity issue could take its attention away from the operation of its business,\nresulting in lost revenue;\n• The Company could incur costs to repair systems made inoperable by a cyberattack and to make changes to its systems to reduce future cyber threats.\nThose changes could include, among other things, obtaining additional technologies as well as employing additional personnel and training\nemployees;\n• The interruption of the Company’s business or theft of proprietary information could harm its ability to compete; and\n• Any losses that the Company may be responsible to bear may not be covered by insurance.\n12\nTable of Contents\nAny of the above potential impacts of a cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nThe Company may not be able to adapt to technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and\nservices. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve clients while reducing costs. The Company’s\nfuture success depends, in part, upon its ability to address client needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands, as\nwell as to create additional efficiencies in its operations. The Company may not be able to implement effectively new technology-driven products and services\nor be successful in marketing these products and services to its clients. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial\nservices industry could negatively affect the Company’s growth, revenue, and profit.\nThe Company operates in an intensely competitive business environment. It may not be as successful as its competitors incorporating artificial intelligence\n(“AI”) into its business or adapting to a rapidly changing marketplace.\nThe Company’s competitors may be larger, more diversified, better funded, and have access to more advanced technology, including AI. These competitive\nadvantages may enable its competition to innovate better and more quickly, or to compete more effectively on quality and price, which could cause the\nCompany to lose business and profitability. Burgeoning interest in AI may increase competition and disrupt the Company’s business model. AI may lower\nbarriers to entry in the industry and the Company may be unable to effectively compete with the products or services offered by new competitors. AI-related\nchanges to the products and services on offer may affect customer expectations, requirements, or tastes in ways that the Company cannot adequately anticipate\nor adapt to, causing its business to lose revenues, market share, or the ability to operate profitably and sustainably.\nOperational risks may disrupt the Company’s business, result in losses, or limit its growth.\nThe Company is dependent on the capacity and reliability of the communications, information, and technology systems supporting its operations, whether\ndeveloped, owned, or operated internally by the Company or by third parties. Operational risks, such as trading or operational errors, interruption of the\nCompany’s financial, accounting, trading, compliance, and other data processing systems, the loss of data contained in such systems, or compromised systems\ndue to cyberattack, could result in a disruption of the Company’s business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage, and thus,\nadversely affect its business.\nIndustry, Market, and Economic Risks\nThe Company’s AUM, which impacts revenue, is subject to significant fluctuations.\nThe majority of the Company’s revenue is calculated as a percentage of AUM or is related to the general performance of the equity securities markets. A\ndecline in securities prices or in the sale of investment products, or an increase in fund redemptions, generally will reduce revenue and net income. Financial\nmarket declines will generally negatively impact the level of the Company’s AUM, and consequently, its revenue and net income. A recession or other\neconomic or political events, whether in the United States or globally could also adversely impact the Company’s revenue, if such events led to a decreased\ndemand for products, a higher redemption rate, or a decline in securities prices. Investor interest in the valuation of the Company’s fixed income strategies are\naffected by changes in interest rates and the overall credit environment. In addition, the majority of the Company’s existing AUM is managed in primarily long-\nonly, equity investment strategies, which exposes it to greater risk than certain of its competitors who may manage assets in more diverse strategies.\nThe Company’s investment approach may underperform other investment approaches during certain market conditions.\nThe Company’s investment strategies are best suited for investors with long-term investment time horizons. The Company’s investment strategies may not\nperform well during certain periods of time. Additionally, the Company could have common positions and industry concentrations across its strategies at the\nsame time. As such, factors leading to underperformance may impact multiple strategies simultaneously.\nThe Company’s investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in its investment portfolio.\nThe Company currently has a substantial portion of its assets invested in investment strategies that it manages. All of these investments are subject to market\nrisk and the Company’s non-operating investment income could be adversely affected by market performance. Fluctuations in investment income are expected\nto occur in the future.\n13\nTable of Contents\nTrading in the Company’s common shares is limited, which may adversely affect the time and the price at which shareholders can sell their shares.\nAlthough the Company’s common shares are listed on the The Nasdaq Global Select Market, the shares are held by a relatively small number of shareholders,\nand trading in its common shares is relatively inactive. The spread between the bid and the ask prices is often wide. As a result, shareholders may not be able to\nsell their shares on short notice, and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price. In addition, certain\nshareholders, including certain of the Company’s directors and officers, own a significant number of shares. The sale of a large number of shares by any such\nindividual could temporarily depress the market price of its shares.\nRegulatory Risks\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax obligations could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in the United States. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions that the Company has\ntaken or may implement changes in tax policy, which may result in the assessment of additional taxes on the Company. The Company regularly assesses the\nappropriateness of its tax positions and reporting. The Company cannot provide assurances, however, that tax authorities will agree with the positions it has\ntaken, or that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could be unfavorable.\nThe Company’s business is subject to substantial governmental regulation, which can change frequently and may increase costs of compliance, reduce revenue,\nresult in fines, penalties, and lawsuits for noncompliance, and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of federal securities laws, including the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, each as amended.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to significant regulation and oversight by the SEC. Changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance\nrequirements could have a significant effect on the Company’s operations and results, including, but not limited to, increased expenses and reduced investor\ninterest in certain funds and other investment products that the Company offers. The Company continually monitors legislative, tax, regulatory, accounting, and\ncompliance developments that could impact its business. The Company and its directors, officers, and employees could be subject to lawsuits or regulatory\nproceedings for violations of such laws and regulations, which could result in the payment of fines or penalties and cause reputational harm to the Company,\nwhich could negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations, as well as divert management’s attention from its operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company’s insurance policies may not cover all losses and costs to which it may be exposed.\nThe Company carries insurance in amounts and under terms that it believes are appropriate. The Company’s insurance may not cover all liabilities and losses to\nwhich it may be exposed. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As the Company’s insurance\npolicies come up for renewal, it may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which could have an adverse impact on its results of\noperations and financial condition.\nNatural disasters, global pandemics, and other unpredictable events could adversely affect the Company’s operations.\nNatural disasters, outbreaks of epidemics or pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other unpredictable events could adversely affect the\nCompany’s revenues, expenses, and net income by:\n• Decreasing investment valuations in, and returns on, the investment portfolios that the Company manages and its corporate investments, thus, causing\nreductions in revenue;\n• Causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive;\n• Reducing the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct the Company’s business activities;\n• Interrupting the Company’s business operations or those of critical service providers;\n• Triggering technology delays or failures; and/or\n14\nTable of Contents\n• Requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to restore the Company’s operations.\nThe Company has developed various backup systems and contingency plans but cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances\nthat could arise, or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. The Company also relies to varying degrees on outside vendors for service\ndelivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support. There is a risk that these vendors will not be able to perform in an adequate and timely\nmanner. If the Company loses the availability of employees, or if it is unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, revenues, expenses,\nand net income could be negatively impacted.\nSpecifically, the effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in early 2020 negatively affected the global economy, the U.S. economy, and the\nglobal financial markets, and demonstrated that pandemics may disrupt the Company’s operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Although the long-term effects of the pandemic cannot be predicted, previous occurrences of other\npandemic and epidemic diseases had an adverse effect on the economies of those countries in which they were most prevalent. A recurrence of an outbreak of\nany kind of epidemic, communicable disease or virus or major public health issue could cause a slowdown in the levels of economic activity generally, which\nwould adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operations.\nITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nITEM 1C. Cybersecurity\nThe Company is subject to several material risks related to cybersecurity threats. A cybersecurity attack could prevent the Company from managing client\nportfolios, cause the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee information, and/or result in misappropriation of information or\nfunds, which individually or collectively could severely harm its business.\nThe Company has an Information Security Committee (the “Committee”) to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks and to implement necessary\npolicies and procedures to mitigate those risks. The Committee also coordinates employee education efforts throughout the year. The Managing Director of\nInformation Technology serves as the Committee chair and the day-to-day manager of the Company’s information security management systems. The\nCommittee is comprised of members having expertise in information technology infrastructure, data security, risk management, compliance, and business\ncontinuity and recovery efforts. The Committee identifies and assesses risks by understanding and evaluating the Company’s systems, processes, data, and\ncontrols. This information is then augmented through participation by certain Committee members in industry threat intelligence groups designed to share best\npractices and emerging threats related to cybersecurity. The Committee also completes a full cybersecurity risk assessment annually, which drives the\nimplementation of policies and procedures as well as the scope of third-party testing. The Committee has implemented a comprehensive set of cybersecurity\npolicies and procedures that follows standards established by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO 27001”). Included are policies and\nprocedures to oversee, identify, and mitigate the Company’s cybersecurity risks as well as cybersecurity risks to the Company associated with its significant\nservice providers and vendors. The Company’s cybersecurity policies and procedures have been independently certified by a third-party as compliant with the\nISO 27001 standard. The Committee engages multiple third-party experts to perform penetration tests on a periodic basis, and to assess whether these policies\nand procedures are designed appropriately and operating effectively.\nCybersecurity oversight forms part of the Board’s risk oversight of the Company. The Board oversees efforts by management to manage the cybersecurity risks\nto which the Company may be exposed. The Board receives at least annual reports and meets periodically with the Chief Compliance Officer and the Managing\nDirector of Information Technology, both of whom serve on the Committee. From its review of these reports and discussions with the Committee and\nmanagement, the Board ensures it has sufficient awareness of the material cybersecurity risks to which the Company is exposed, enabling a dialogue about how\nmanagement manages and mitigates those risks. The Board currently has three members who have obtained certifications in cybersecurity oversight.\n15\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2.

During 2023 and 2022, approximately 3,143,990 and 2,472,866, of DHIL’s common shares were\ntraded, respectively.\nEach fiscal quarter, the Board determines whether to approve and pay a regular quarterly dividend. In addition to the regular quarterly dividends, in the fourth\nquarter of each fiscal year, the Board decides whether to approve and pay a special dividend. Although DHIL currently expects to pay regular quarterly\ndividends, depending on the circumstances and the Board’s judgment, DHIL may not pay quarterly or special dividends.\nThe approximate number of record holders of DHIL common shares as of February 28, 2024 was 71.

The 2023 Repurchase Program will\nexpire on May 10, 2025, or upon the earlier completion of all authorized purchases under the program.\nIn connection with the 2023 Repurchase Program, DHIL entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. The Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement is intended to\nqualify for the safe harbor under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. A Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement allows a company to purchase its shares at times when\nit would not ordinarily be in the market because of its trading policies or the possession of material nonpublic information. Because repurchases under a Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement are subject to specified parameters and certain price, timing, and volume restraints specified in the arrangement, there is no\nguarantee as to the exact number of common shares that will be repurchased or that there will be any repurchases at all pursuant to the arrangement. Purchases\nin the open market are intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2023, $26.4 million remained available for\nrepurchases under the 2023 Repurchase Program.\nSale of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, DHIL did not sell any common shares that were not registered under the Securities Act.\nITEM 6. [Reserved]\nITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn this Item 7, the Company discusses and analyzes its consolidated results of operations for the past three fiscal years and other factors that may affect its\nfuture financial performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated\nfinancial statements contained in this Form 10-K.\nCertain statements the Company makes under this Item 7 constitute “forward-looking statements” under the PSLR Act. See “Cautionary Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 1. You should also consider the Company’s forward-looking statements in light of the risks discussed Part I, Item\n1A, as well as our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and our other filings\nwith the SEC.\n19\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Environment1\nThe performance of the U.S. and international equity markets, as well as the U.S. fixed income market, have a direct impact on the Company’s operations and\nfinancial position. A significant portion of the year’s gains in equities came in the final two months. The MSCI All Country World Index advanced 6.75%\nthrough the end of October but finished the year with a 22.20% return. Non-U.S. developed markets rose 18% for the year (as measured by the MSCI EAFE\nIndex) and emerging markets were up 10% (as measured by the MSCI EM Index). U.S. stocks outpaced their developed market counterparts, rising 26% (as\nmeasured by the Russell 3000 Index). For the year, small-cap stocks were up nearly 17%, mid-cap stocks delivered just over 17%, and large-cap stocks were\nup a resounding 27% (all returns as measured by the respective Russell indices). Fixed income returns were similarly back-end loaded.The Bloomberg U.S.\nCorporate Bond Index returned 8.50% in the fourth quarter, compared to the full-year return of 8.52%. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index finished\n2023 with a return of 5.53%, the best calendar year return since 2020 (7.51%). The Bloomberg U.S. Securitized Index ended the year with a 5.08% return, the\nsector’s best return since 2019 (6.44%).\nDespite positive market returns in 2023, combined mutual fund and exchange traded fund (“ETFs”) flows were a modest +$70B. This is up from 2022 which\nsaw $369 billion in outflows but marks the third lowest total flows over the past 20 years. Passively managed funds had inflows of $527 billion while actively\nmanaged funds had outflows of $458 billion. Investors favored ETFs over mutual funds as ETFs brought in $580 billion compared to outflows of $510 billion\nin mutual funds. These flow trends have persisted for a number of years, resulting in 2023 becoming the first year in which total assets in passive products\nexceeded those of actively managed products.\nU.S. equity products saw $24 billion in aggregate net outflows. All nine U.S. Equity Morningstar Categories saw active product net outflows, while large value\nproducts saw net outflows from both actively managed and passively managed large value funds. This followed meaningful outperformance of the Russell\n1000 Growth Index (+42.68%) versus the Russell 1000 Value Index (up 11.46%) driven by the results of a small number of companies with large weightings in\nthe growth index. Despite these overall flow trends, actively managed U.S. equity funds with a five-star Morningstar RatingTM had positive flows, a reminder\nthat investors have continued to select the best performing actively managed investment strategies.\nTaxable bond funds in aggregate brought in $223 billion, $161 billion of which was into passively managed ETFs. Flows were led by the intermediate core\nbond category, which had inflows of $123 billion. Within this category, ETFs share of total assets has increased from 15% to 20% from 2019 to 2023.\nThere were nearly 400 new actively managed ETF products introduced to the market in 2023. While actively managed ETF assets represent only 6% of total\nETF assets, the $118 billion of actively managed ETF inflows represented 20% of total ETF flows. We expect continued ETF product development in the\nindustry including actively managed and fully transparent offerings. Today, ETFs do not allow managers to limit the capacity of their offerings, which limits\nthe applicability of this vehicle for many of the Company’s strategies.\nThe Company continues to pursue ways to partner with clients to deliver its intellectual property, including through model-delivery, separately managed\naccounts (“SMAs”), and other investment vehicles. Active mutual funds have lost share within intermediary investors asset allocations to SMAs, ETFs, and\nmodels. SMAs and model delivery have advantages over ETFs by enabling clients to further personalize portfolios to their unique preferences and tax\nsituations. Other vehicles with non-daily redemptions may see growing demand among investors seeking investment strategies focused on less liquid\nsecurities. These strategies and private market investments are a meaningful and increasing share of institutional investors asset allocations and search activity.\n1 All net asset and flow data stated in this Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are sourced from\nMorningstar, Inc. © 2023 Morningstar, Inc.

Strong investment performance is the key driver of long-term success and\nmeaningfully influences the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients.\nThe strategies offered by the Company have generally tended to fare well compared to their peers in the relevant Morningstar categories. Relative returns\nversus core benchmarks have been more challenging, as many valuation-sensitive investors have struggled to keep pace with core benchmarks.\nBelow is a summary of the performance of the Funds compared to their respective Morningstar categories and the Company’s investment strategy composite\nreturns compared to their respective benchmarks. Note that a number of the Company's strategies do not yet have a 10-year or 15-year track record. To see\nmore detail, a table is included below these illustrations which provides information on inception date, performance since inception, and the U.S. equity\nstrategies' performance relative to the Core and Value benchmarks.\nSource: © 2023 Morningstar, Inc.

Investment advisory and administration fees paid to\nDHCM are generally based on the value of the investment portfolios it manages and fluctuate with changes in the total value of its AUM. The Company,\nthrough DHCM, recognizes revenue when DHCM satisfies its performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a client.\nModel Delivery Programs - Assets Under Advisement\nDHCM provides strategy-specific model portfolios to sponsors of model delivery programs. DHCM is paid for its services by the program sponsor at a pre-\ndetermined rate based on AUA in the model delivery programs. DHCM does not have discretionary investment authority over individual client accounts in\nmodel delivery programs, and therefore, the AUA is not included in the Company’s AUM.\nThe Company’s revenues are highly dependent on both the value and composition of AUM and AUA. The following is a summary of the Company’s AUM by\nproduct and investment objective, a roll-forward of the change in AUM, and a summary of AUA for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\nAssets Under Management and Assets Under Advisement\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nDiamond Hill Funds $ 15,879 $ 14,745 $ 19,786\nSeparately managed accounts 6,617 6,220 7,232\nCollective investment trusts 1,359 1,040 603\nOther pooled vehicles 3,563 2,758 3,407\nTotal AUM 27,418 24,763 31,028\nTotal AUA 1,746 1,802 2,098\nTotal AUM and AUA $ 29,164 $ 26,565 $ 33,126\n24\nTable of Contents\nAssets Under Management\nby Investment Strategy\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nU.S. Equity\nLarge Cap $ 17,307 $ 16,478 $ 21,285\nSmall-Mid Cap 2,588 2,646 3,183\nMid Cap 1,023 899 1,165\nSelect 593 392 438\nSmall Cap 255 306 597\nLarge Cap Concentrated 98 99 64\nMicro Cap 21 15 16\nTotal U.S. Equity 21,885 20,835 26,748\nAlternatives\nLong-Short 1,725 1,752 1,998\nTotal Alternatives 1,725 1,752 1,998\nInternational Equity\nInternational 109 52 56\nTotal International Equity 109 52 56\nFixed Income\nShort Duration Securitized Bond 1,948 1,308 1,613\nCore Fixed Income 1,735 792 622\nLong Duration Treasury 26 33 51\nTotal Fixed Income 3,709 2,133 2,286\nTotal-All Strategies 27,428 24,772 31,088\n(Less: Investments in affiliated funds)(a) (10) (9) (60)\nTotal AUM 27,418 24,763 31,028\nTotal AUA(b) 1,746 1,802 2,098\nTotal AUM and AUA $ 29,164 $ 26,565 $ 33,126\n(a) Certain of the Funds own shares of the Diamond Hill Short Duration Securitized Bond Fund.

Net\noutflows from the Company’s other equity strategies totaled approximately $0.5 billion. Outflows from the equity strategies were partially offset by fixed\nincome net inflows of $1.4 billion into the Company’s fixed income strategies.\n2022 Discussion of Net Cash Outflows\nFlows out of the Company’s equity strategies were largely driven by flows out of its Large Cap strategy, which experienced net outflows of $1.9 billion. The\nLarge Cap strategy was soft closed during 2022. The strategy was fully reopened on February 28, 2023. Net outflows from the Company’s other equity\nstrategies totaled approximately $0.3 billion. The Company’s fixed income strategies saw mixed results with net flows of $0.3 billion into its Core Bond\nstrategy offsetting outflows from its Short Duration Securitized Bond Fund of $0.2 billion. The Company also saw growth in its CIT offerings. In addition to\nnew clients, some larger plans moved from the Funds into the CITs.\n2021 Discussion of Net Cash Inflows\nBoth the Company’s equity and fixed income strategies experienced net inflows during 2021. Flows in the Company’s equity strategies were largely driven by\nits Large Cap strategy, which experienced net inflows of $2.1 billion. These net inflows were partially offset by net outflows from the Company’s other equity\nstrategies totaling approximately $1.2 billion. The Company’s fixed income strategies, including the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts prior to their sale,\nhad net positive flows of $1.2 billion during 2021.\n26\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following is a table and discussion of the Company’s consolidated results of operations.\n(in thousands, except per share amounts and\npercentages) 2023 2022 % Change 2022 2021 % Change\nTotal revenue $ 136,716 $ 154,496 (12)% $ 154,496 $ 182,194 (15)%\nNet operating income 35,504 64,331 (45)% 64,331 76,258 (16)%\nAdjusted net operating income (a) 41,434 60,352 (31)% 60,352 83,680 (28)%\nInvestment income (loss), net 23,071 (20,187) NM (20,187) 16,381 NM\nGain on sale of High Yield-Focused Advisory\nContracts — 6,814 (100)% 6,814 9,000 (24)%\nIncome tax expense 15,490 14,088 10% 14,088 26,050 (46)%\nNet income attributable to common\nshareholders 42,226 40,434 4% 40,434 74,201 (46)%\nEarnings per share attributable to common\nshareholders (diluted) $ 14.32 $ 13.01 10% $ 13.01 $ 23.34 (44)%\nAdjusted earnings per share attributable to\ncommon shareholders (diluted)(a) $ 10.28 $ 14.40 (29)% $ 14.40 $ 19.48 (26)%\nNet operating profit margin 26 % 42 % NM 42 % 42 % NM\nAdjusted net operating profit margin (a) 30 % 39 % NM 39 % 46 % NM\n(a) Adjusted net operating income, adjusted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders (diluted), and adjusted net operating profit margin are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.

Refer to the “Revenue” section below in Part II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10-K for further details on the decrease in the average advisory fee rate. The Company recognized $1.2 million of performance-based fees during\n2023 compared to $1.5 million of performance-based fees during 2022.\nNet operating profit margin was 26% for 2023 and 42% for 2022. Adjusted net operating profit margin was 30% for 2023 and 39% for 2022. The decrease in\nnet operating profit margin is primarily due to a 12% decrease in revenues while compensation and related costs (excluding deferred compensation) increased\napproximately $0.2 million (less than 1%) period-over-period. In addition, the investment gains on the Company’s deferred compensation investments\nincreased deferred compensation expense during the current period, decreasing the current period operating margin by 4%. Adjusted net operating profit\nmargin excludes the impact of market movements on the deferred compensation liability and related economic hedges, and the impact of the Diamond Hill\nInternational Fund and the Diamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund (the “Consolidated Fund(s)”). Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements\nfor a detailed description of the funds that are consolidated in each year. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation” section below in\nPart II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further details on adjusted net operating profit margin.\nThe Company expects that its operating margin will fluctuate from period to period based on various factors, including revenues, investment results in the\nstrategies the Company manages, employee performance, staffing levels, and gains and losses on investments held in the Diamond Hill Fixed Term Deferred\nCompensation Plan and the Diamond Hill Variable Term Deferred Compensation Plan (together, the “Deferred Compensation Plans”).\nThe Company had $23.1 million in investment income due to market appreciation in 2023, compared to $20.2 million in investment loss due to market declines\nin 2022.\nThe Company recorded a gain of $6.8 million from the final payment on the sale of its High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts during 2022.\n27\nTable of Contents\nIncome tax expense increased $1.4 million for 2023, compared to 2022. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in the Company’s\nincome before taxes, which was partially offset by a decrease in its effective tax rate from 27.6% to 26.4% year-over-year. The decrease in the Company’s\neffective tax rate in 2023 was primarily due to the benefit attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nThe Company generated net income attributable to common shareholders of $42.2 million ($14.32 per diluted share) for 2023, compared to $40.4 million\n($13.01 per diluted share) for 2022. The year-over-year increase in net income attributable to common shareholders was primarily due to investment income in\n2023 compared to investment loss in 2022 due to the market environment. The increase in investment income in 2023 was partially offset by a decline of\nrevenues as a result of decreased average AUM and AUA, while the investment losses in 2022 were partially offset by the recognition during 2022 of a $6.8\nmillion gain from the final payment on the sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts.\nSummary Discussion of Consolidated Results of Operations - 2022 Compared to 2021\nRevenue for 2022 decreased $27.7 million compared to 2021, primarily due to a 9% decrease in average AUM and $1.5 million in performance-based fees\nearned in 2022 compared to $11.9 million of performance-based fees in 2021. A significant performance-based agreement reached its first five-year\nmeasurement term on September 30, 2021. Since the initial five-year measurement period ended, the performance-based fee has been calculated annually based\non the client investment results over the recently completed five-year period. The average advisory fee rate (excluding performance-based fees) remained\nunchanged at 0.52% year-over-year.\nNet operating profit margin was 42% for both 2022 and 2021 respectively. Adjusted net operating profit margin was 39% for 2022 and 46% for 2021. Adjusted\nnet operating profit margin excludes the impact of market movements on the deferred compensation liability and related economic hedges, and the impact of\nthe Diamond Hill International Fund and the Diamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund (together, the “Consolidated Funds”). See the “Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures and Reconciliation” section below in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company expects that its operating margin will fluctuate from period to period based on various factors, including revenues, investment results in the\nstrategies the Company manages, employee performance, staffing levels, and gains and losses on investments held in the Deferred Compensation Plans.\nThe Company had $20.2 million in investment losses due to market declines for 2022 compared to $16.4 million in investment income due to market\nappreciation for 2021.\nThe Company recorded a gain of $6.8 million from the final payment on the sale of its High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts during 2022, and a gain of $9.0\nmillion from the initial payment on the sale of its High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts during 2021.\nIncome tax expense decreased $12.0 million for 2022, compared to 2021. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the\nCompany’s income before taxes, which was partially offset by an increase in its effective tax rate from 25.6% to 27.6% year-over-year. The increase in the\nCompany’s effective tax rate in 2022 was primarily due to the benefit attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nThe Company generated net income attributable to common shareholders of $40.4 million ($13.01 per diluted share) for 2022, compared to $74.2 million\n($23.34 per diluted share) for 2021. The year-over-year decrease in net income attributable to common shareholders was primarily due to the decline of\nrevenues as a result of decreased AUM, the decrease in performance-based fees, and investment losses in 2022 due to the market environment.\nRevenue\n(in thousands, except percentages) 2023 2022 % Change 2022 2021 % Change\nInvestment advisory $ 129,180 $ 144,326 (10)% $ 144,326 $ 170,138 (15)%\nMutual fund administration, net 7,536 10,170 (26)% 10,170 12,056 (16)%\nTotal $ 136,716 $ 154,496 (12)% $ 154,496 $ 182,194 (15)%\n28\nTable of Contents\nRevenue - 2023 Compared to 2022\nInvestment Advisory Fees. Investment advisory fees decreased by $15.1 million, or 10%, from 2022 to 2023. Investment advisory fees are calculated as a\npercentage of the market value of client accounts at contractual fee rates, which vary by investment product. The decrease in investment advisory fees was\nprimarily due to a decrease in total average AUM and AUA of 7.5% and a decrease in the average advisory fee rate (excluding performance-based fees) from\n0.48% to 0.47% period over period. The average advisory fee rate (excluding performance-based fees) for equity assets decreased from 0.50% in 2022 to\n0.49% in 2023, and the average advisory fee rate for fixed income assets decreased from 0.31% in 2022 to 0.30% in 2023. The decrease in the total average\nadvisory fee rate was due to the growth in fixed income assets, which increased from 8% of total average AUM and AUA in 2022, to 11% in 2023. The average\nadvisory fee rate is calculated by dividing investment advisory revenues by total average AUM and AUA during the period. Also, the Company recognized $1.2\nmillion of performance-based fees during 2023, compared to $1.5 million of performance-based fees during 2022.\nMutual Fund Administration Fees. Mutual fund administration fees decreased $2.6 million, or 26%, from 2022 compared to 2023. Mutual fund\nadministration fees include administration fees received from the Funds, which are calculated as a percentage of the Funds’ average AUM. This decrease was\nprimarily due to the impact of a 13% decrease in the Funds’ average AUM from 2022 compared to 2023, and an increase in administration fees paid on behalf\nof the Funds as a percentage of average Fund AUM.\nRevenue - 2022 Compared to 2021\nInvestment Advisory Fees. Investment advisory fees decreased by $25.8 million, or 15%, from 2021 to 2022. Investment advisory fees are calculated as a\npercentage of the market value of client accounts at contractual fee rates, which vary by investment product.\nThe Company recognized $1.5 million of performance-based fees in 2022 compared to $11.9 million of performance-based fees recognized in 2021. A\nsignificant performance-based agreement reached the end of its first five-year measurement period on September 30, 2021. Since the initial five-year\nmeasurement period ended, the performance-based fee has been calculated annually based on the client investment results over the recently completed five-\nyear period.\nThe remaining decrease in investment advisory fees was due to a decrease of 9% in average AUM year over year. The average advisory fee rate (excluding\nperformance-based fees) was 0.52% for both 2022 and 2021.\nMutual Fund Administration Fees. Mutual fund administration fees decreased $1.9 million, or 16%, from 2021 compared to 2022. Mutual fund\nadministration fees include administration fees received from the Funds, which are calculated as a percentage of the Funds’ average AUM.

Deferred compensation expense was $5.6 million for 2023 compared to a benefit of $4.4 million for 2022,\nprimarily due to market appreciation on the Deferred Compensation Plans’ investments in 2023 compared to market declines in 2022.\nThe gain (loss) on the Deferred Compensation Plans’ investments increases (decreases) deferred compensation expense (benefit) and is included in operating\nincome. Deferred compensation expense (benefit) is offset by an equal amount in investment income (loss) below net operating income on the consolidated\nstatements of income, and thus, has no impact on net income attributable to the Company.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 10%, from 2022 compared to 2023. This increase was\nprimarily due to an increase in investment research-related expenses of $0.6 million, an increase in consulting expenses of $0.4 million, and an increase in\nrecruiting expenses of $0.3 million.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 7%, from 2022 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a\nreduction in payments made to third party intermediaries as a result of the decrease in the Funds’ average AUM period over period.\nMutual Fund Administration. Mutual fund administration expenses decreased by less than $0.1 million, or 1%, from 2022 compared to 2023. Mutual fund\nadministration expenses consist of both variable and fixed expenses. The variable expenses are based on Fund AUM levels and the number of shareholder\naccounts. The decrease was due to a reduction in variable expenses as a result of the decrease in the Funds’ average AUM period over period.\nExpenses - 2022 Compared to 2021\nCompensation and Related Costs, Excluding Deferred Compensation Expense (Benefit). Employee compensation and benefits decreased by $3.1 million,\nor 4%, from 2021 compared to 2022. This decrease is due to a decrease in accrued incentive compensation of $6.2 million and a decrease in other\ncompensation expense of $0.7 million, which was partially offset by an increase in restricted stock expense of $3.3 million related to restricted stock grants\nissued in February of 2022 under the Company’s long-term incentive program, and an increase in salary and related benefits of $0.5 million. On average, the\nCompany had 129 employees in 2022 and 126 in 2021. Incentive compensation expense can fluctuate significantly period over period as the Company\nevaluates investment performance, individual performance, its own performance, and other factors.\nDeferred Compensation Expense (Benefit). Deferred compensation benefit was $4.4 million for 2022 compared to an expense of $7.1 million for 2021.\nThe gain (loss) on the Deferred Compensation Plans’ investments increases (decreases) deferred compensation expense (benefit) and is included in operating\nincome. Deferred compensation expense (benefit) is offset by an equal amount in investment income (loss) below net operating income on the consolidated\nstatements of income, and thus, has no impact on net income attributable to the Company.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2022 decreased by $0.4 million, or 3%, compared to 2021. This decrease was primarily\ndue to a decrease of $0.7 million in consulting fees and $0.5 million of proxy solicitation fees related to the sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts\nin 2021. That decrease was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in investment research and related conference fees, a $0.1 million increase in insurance\nexpense, and a $0.2 million increase in IT staffing, hardware, and software expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses for 2022 decreased by $0.5 million, or 7%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to\ndecreases of $0.9 million in payments made to third-party intermediaries related to the sale of the Funds on their platforms, and $0.2 million related to its\ndistribution technology platform and related external data costs. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.6 million in sales-related travel\nexpenses.\nMutual Fund Administration. Mutual fund administration expenses for 2022 decreased by $0.3 million, or 8%, compared to 2021. Mutual fund\nadministration expenses consist of both variable and fixed expenses. The variable expenses are based on Fund AUM levels and the number of shareholder\naccounts. The decrease was due to a reduction in variable expenses as a result of the decrease in the Funds’ average AUM period-over-period.\n30\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nThe Company’s current financial condition is liquid, with a significant amount of its assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts\nreceivable, and other current assets. The Company’s main source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities, which are generated from investment\nadvisory and mutual fund administration fees. Cash and cash equivalents, investments held directly by DHCM, accounts receivable, and other current assets\nrepresented $181.8 million and $182.9 million of total assets as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The Company believes that these sources of\nliquidity, as well as its continuing cash flows from operating activities, will be sufficient to meet its current and future operating needs for the next 12 months.\nUses of Liquidity\nThe Company anticipates that its main uses of cash will be for operating expenses and seed capital to fund new and existing investment strategies. The Board\nand management regularly review various factors to determine whether the Company has capital in excess of that required for its business and what are the\nappropriate uses of any such excess capital, including share repurchases and/or the payment of dividends.\nShare Repurchases\nOn May 10, 2023, the Board approved the 2023 Repurchase Program. The 2023 Repurchase Program authorizes management to repurchase up to $50.0 million\nof DHIL’s common shares in the open market and in private transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The 2023 Repurchase Program will\nexpire on May 10, 2025, or upon the earlier completion of all authorized purchases under the program. As of December 31, 2023, $26.4 million remained\navailable for repurchases under the 2023 Repurchase Program. Prior to the approval of the 2023 Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased shares under\nsimilar prior repurchase programs.\nThe authority to repurchase shares may be exercised from time to time as market conditions warrant and is subject to regulatory constraints. The timing,\namount, and other terms and conditions of any repurchases will be determined by management in its discretion based on a variety of factors, including the\nmarket price of such shares, corporate considerations, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s annual share repurchase transactions:\nTotal Number\nof Shares Average Price Purchase Price of Shares\nYear Purchased Paid Per Share Purchased Purchased\n2023 212,638 $ 162.81 $ 34,619,944\n2022 217,009 178.45 38,726,007\n2021 45,727 171.02 7,820,315\nTotal 475,374 $ 157.65 $ 81,166,266\nDividends\nFiscal 2023 was the 16th consecutive year that the Company paid a dividend.\nA summary of cash dividends paid during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is presented below:\nRegular Dividend Regular Dividend Special Dividend Special Dividend Total Dividend\nYear Per Share Total Per Share Total Per Share Total Dividends\n2023 $ 6.00 $ 17,676,364 $ — $ — $ 6.00 $ 17,676,364\n2022 $ 6.00 18,637,238 $ 4.00 12,059,669 $ 10.00 30,696,907\n2021 $ 4.00 12,700,876 $ 19.00 60,260,100 $ 23.00 72,960,976\nTotal $ 49,014,478 $ 72,319,769 $ 121,334,247\nOn February 28, 2024, the Board approved a regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of 2024 of $1.50 per share to be paid on March 22, 2024, to\nshareholders of record as of March 11, 2024. This dividend is expected to reduce shareholders’ equity by approximately $4.3 million. Subject to Board\napproval and compliance with applicable law, the Company expects to pay a regular quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share in 2024.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the regular quarterly dividends, the Board will decide whether to approve and pay an additional special dividend in the fourth quarter of each\nfiscal year. After assessing the current market environment, the level of share repurchases during the year, as well as the regular dividend paid during 2023, the\nCompany decided not to issue a special dividend in 2023. Although the Company currently expects to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, depending\non the circumstances and the Board’s judgment, the Company may not pay quarterly or special dividends as described.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of approximately $146.1 million, compared to $144.9 million as of December 31, 2022.

The\nCompany expects that cash flows provided by operating activities will continue to serve as its primary source of working capital in the near future.\nIn 2023, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $34.7 million. Cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by net income of $43.1\nmillion as well as non-cash adjustments added back to net income consisting of share-based compensation of $11.7 million and depreciation of $1.3 million.\nThese cash inflows were partially offset by the net change in securities held by the Consolidated Funds of $10.9 million and the cash impact of timing\ndifferences in the settlement of other assets and liabilities of $10.5 million.

These cash inflows were partially offset by net securities purchased by the Consolidated Funds of $50.4 million, net gains\non investments of $10.9 million, and the adjustment to net income of $9.0 million for the gain on sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts. Net cash\nprovided by operating activities of $26.3 million was inclusive of $50.3 million of cash used in operations by the Consolidated Funds.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe Company’s cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and purchases and redemptions in\nits investment portfolio.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $4.2 million in 2023.

The cash provided was due to proceeds from the sale of Company-sponsored\ninvestments totaling $6.9 million and $6.8 million of proceeds received from the final payment for the sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts.\nThese proceeds were partially offset by purchases of Company-sponsored investments of $7.6 million and property and equipment purchases of $0.1 million.\nCash flows provided by investing activities totaled $27.3 million in 2021. The cash provided was due to proceeds from the sale of Company-sponsored\ninvestments totaling $40.8 million and $9.0 million of proceeds received from the sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts. These proceeds were\npartially offset by purchases of Company-sponsored investments of $21.4 million and property and equipment purchases (primarily capitalized software) of\n$1.1 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe Company’s cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of the repurchase of DHIL common shares, dividends paid on DHIL common shares,\nDHIL common shares withheld related to employee tax withholding proceeds received under the Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan (“ESPP”), and distributions to, or contributions from, redeemable noncontrolling interest holders.\nIn 2023, net cash used in financing activities totaled $46.7 million, consisting of repurchases of DHIL’s common shares of $34.6 million, the payment of\ndividends of $17.7 million, and the value of shares withheld to cover employee tax withholding obligations of $5.2 million.

Management believes the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures below are useful measures of the Company’s core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business,\nand help facilitate comparisons to Company operating performance across periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for\nfinancial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. The following schedules reconcile the\ndifferences between financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nEarnings per share\nNet income attributable to\nTotal non- attributable to common\n(in thousands, except percentages Total operating Net operating operating Income tax common shareholders - Net operating\nand per share data) expenses income income expense(5) shareholders diluted profit margin\nGAAP Basis $ 101,212 $ 35,504 $ 23,071 $ 15,490 $ 42,226 $ 14.32 26 %\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nDeferred compensation liability(1) (5,600) 5,600 (5,600) — — — 4 %\nConsolidated Funds(2) — 330 (4,148) (793) (2,166) (0.73) —\nOther investment income(4) — — $ (13,323) (3,571) (9,752) (3.31) —\nAdjusted Non-GAAP Basis $ 95,612 $ 41,434 — $ 11,126 $ 30,308 $ 10.28 30 %\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nEarnings per\nNet income share attributable\nTotal attributable to to common\n(in thousands, except percentages and operating Net operating Total non- Income tax common shareholders - Net operating\nper share data) expenses income operating loss expense(5) shareholders diluted profit margin\nGAAP Basis $ 90,165 $ 64,331 $ (13,373) $ 14,088 $ 40,434 $ 13.01 42 %\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nDeferred compensation liability(1) 4,402 (4,402) 4,402 — — — (3)%\nConsolidated Funds(2) — 423 11,317 2,113 6,063 1.95 —\nGain on sale of High Yield-Focused\nAdvisory Contracts(3) — — (6,814) (1,761) (5,053) (1.63) —\nOther investment income(4) — — $ 4,468 1,155 3,313 1.07 —\nAdjusted Non-GAAP Basis $ 94,567 $ 60,352 — $ 15,595 $ 44,757 $ 14.40 39 %\n36\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nEarnings per\nshare\nNet income attributable to\nTotal Total non- attributable to common\n(in thousands, except percentages operating Net operating operating Income tax common shareholders - Net operating\nand per share data) expenses income income expense(5) shareholders diluted profit margin\nGAAP Basis $ 105,936 $ 76,258 $ 25,381 $ 26,050 $ 74,201 $ 23.34 42 %\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nDeferred compensation liability(1) (7,082) 7,082 (7,082) — — — 4 %\nConsolidated Funds(2) — 340 (6,192) (1,160) (3,304) (1.04) — %\nGain on sale of High Yield-\nFocused Advisory Contracts(3) — — (9,000) (2,339) (6,661) (2.10) — %\nOther investment income(4) — — $ (3,107) (808) (2,299) (0.72) — %\nAdjusted Non-GAAP Basis $ 98,854 $ 83,680 — $ 21,743 $ 61,937 $ 19.48 46 %\n(1) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense resulting from market valuation changes in the Deferred Compensation Plans’ liability and\nthe related net gains/losses on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation\nPlans are adjusted for appreciation/depreciation of investments chosen by participants. The Company believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment\nincome or loss realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help readers understand the Company’s core\noperating results and to improve comparability from period to period.\n(2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact that the Consolidated Funds have on the Company’s GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically,\nthe Company adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the Consolidated Funds. The adjustment to net operating income\nrepresents the operating expenses of the Consolidated Funds, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net\nincome attributable to common shareholders represents the net income of the Consolidated Funds, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company\nbelieves removing the impact of the Consolidated Funds helps readers understand its core operating results and improves comparability from period to period.\n(3) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact of the gain on the sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts. The sale of the High Yield-Focused\nAdvisory Contracts was a discrete transaction, thus, the Company believes that removing the impact of the gain helps readers understand the Company’s core\noperating results and improves comparability period to period.\n(4) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the net gains or losses earned on the Company’s non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as\neconomic hedges of the Deferred Compensation Plans’ liability, non-consolidated seed investments, and other investments. The Company believes adjusting\nfor these non-operating income or loss items helps readers understand the Company’s core operating results and improves comparability from period to period.\n(5) The income tax expense impacts were calculated and resulted in an overall non-GAAP effective tax rate of 26.8% for 2023, 25.8% for 2022 and 26.0% for\n2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates such estimates, judgments, and assumptions\non an ongoing basis, and bases its estimates, judgements, and assumptions on historical experiences, current trends, and various other factors that it believes to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and actual results may differ\nmaterially from these estimates.\nConsolidation. The Company consolidates all subsidiaries and certain investments in which the Company has a controlling interest. The Company is generally\ndeemed to have a controlling interest when it owns the majority of the voting interest of a voting rights entity (“VRE”) or are deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). A VIE is an\n37\nTable of Contents\nentity that lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities, or any entity whose equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity\nnormally associated with an equity investment. The Company’s analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and considers\nseveral factors, including an entity’s legal organization, equity structure, the rights of the investment holders, the Company’s ownership interest in the entity,\nand its contractual involvement with the entity. The Company continually reviews and reconsiders its VIE or VRE conclusions upon the occurrence of certain\nevents, such as changes to its ownership interest, or amendments to contract documents.\nProvisions for Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and\ndeferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment\nis required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns.\nRevenue Recognition on Performance-Based Advisory Contracts. DHCM has certain investment advisory contracts in which a portion of the fees are based on\ninvestment performance achieved in the respective client portfolio in excess of a specified hurdle rate. These fees are calculated based on client investment\nresults over rolling five-year periods. The Company records performance-based fees at the end of the contract measurement period because the performance-\nbased fees earned are constrained based on movements in the financial markets.\nRevenue Recognition when Acting as an Agent vs. Principal. The Funds have selected and contractually engaged certain vendors to fulfill various services to\nbenefit the Funds’ shareholders or to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Funds. These services include, among others, required fund shareholder mailings,\nregistration services, and legal and audit services. DHCM, in fulfilling a portion of its role under the administration agreement with the Funds, acts as agent to\npay these obligations of the Funds. Each vendor is independently responsible for fulfillment of the services it has been engaged to provide and negotiates fees\nand terms with the management and board of trustees of the Funds. The fee that the Funds pay to DHCM is reviewed annually by the Funds’ board of trustees\nand specifically considers the contractual expenses that DHCM pays on behalf of the Funds. As a result, DHCM is not involved in the delivery or pricing of\nthese services and bears no risk related to these services. Revenue has been recorded net of these Fund expenses, as appropriate for this agency relationship.\nITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company’s revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of its AUM. Accordingly, declines in financial market values directly and negatively\nimpact its investment advisory revenues and net income.\nThe Company invests in its investment strategies, which are market risk sensitive financial instruments. These investments have inherent market risk in the\nform of price risk due to the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in their fair value. Market prices fluctuate, and the amount realized\nupon subsequent sale may differ significantly from the reported market value.\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s market risks as of December 31, 2023, and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and decrease in\ninvestments.\nFair Value Fair Value\nAssuming a Assuming a\nFair Value as of December Hypothetical Hypothetical\n31, 2023 10% Increase 10% Decrease\nEquity investments $ 110,296,156 $ 121,325,772 $ 99,266,540\nFixed Income investments 37,442,706 41,186,977 33,698,435\nTotal $ 147,738,862 $ 162,512,749 $ 132,964,975\n38\nITEM 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the assets under management data used in the calculation of investment advisory fee revenue for separately managed accounts (excluding\nperformance-based fees), collective investment trusts and other pooled vehicles.\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes investment advisory revenue for its separately managed accounts\n(excluding performance-based fees), collective investment trusts and other pooled vehicles based on a percentage of its assets under management (AUM). The\nCompany recognized $38.0 million in investment advisory fees related to separately managed accounts (excluding performance-based fees), collective\ninvestment trusts and other pooled vehicles during the year ended December 31, 2023. AUM is an input to the calculation of the investment advisory fee\nrevenue. Specifically, as it pertains to these accounts, the inputs to the AUM calculation and the calculated AUM value are transmitted through multiple\ninformation technology (IT) systems used in the calculation of investment advisory fee revenue.\n40\nWe identified the evaluation of the AUM data used in the calculation of separately managed accounts (excluding performance-based fees), collective\ninvestment trusts and other pooled vehicles investment advisory fee revenue as a critical audit matter. There is a high degree of auditor judgment required to\nperform procedures to address the Company’s use of multiple IT systems to maintain the AUM data, including the use of professionals with specialized skills\nand knowledge to test the AUM data processed through multiple IT systems.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the inputs to the AUM calculation, as well as controls that reconcile\nAUM between IT systems. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the testing of application and related general IT\ncontrols relevant to the IT systems used to maintain AUM data. We compared AUM used in the calculation of investment advisory fees to the source IT\nsystems for a selection of accounts.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2012.\nColumbus,

Financial Statements\nNote 1 Business and Organization\nDHIL derives its consolidated revenues and net income from investment advisory and fund administration services provided by DHCM. DHCM is a registered\ninvestment adviser. DHCM is the investment adviser and administrator for the Funds. DHCM also provides investment advisory services to DHMF, a private\nfund, separately managed accounts, CITs, other pooled vehicles including sub-advised funds, and model delivery programs.\nNote 2 Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and in accordance\nwith the instructions to Form 10-K. The Company believes that the disclosures contained herein are adequate to make the information presented not\nmisleading.\nThese consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of the Company, all material adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments)\nnecessary to fairly present the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and results of operations for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense\nduring the reporting period. Estimates have been prepared based on the most current and best available information, but actual results could differ materially\nfrom those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of DHIL and its consolidated subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and\nbalances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nDHCM holds certain investments in the Funds and DHMF for general corporate investment purposes, to provide seed capital for newly formed strategies, or to\nadd capital to existing strategies. The Funds are organized in a series fund structure in which there are multiple mutual funds within one trust (the “Trust”). The\nTrust is an open-end investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Each individual Fund\nrepresents a separate share class of a legal entity organized under the Trust. DHMF is organized as a Delaware limited partnership and is exempt from\nregistration under the 1940 Act.\nDHIL consolidates those subsidiaries and investments over which it has a controlling interest. The Company is generally deemed to have a controlling interest\nwhen it owns the majority of the voting interest of a voting rights entity (“VRE”) or is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity\n(“VIE”). A VIE is an entity that lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities, or any entity whose equity holders do not have defined power to direct the\nactivities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment. The Company’s analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves\njudgment and consideration of several factors, including an entity’s legal organization, equity structure, the rights of the investment holders, the Company’s\nownership interest in the entity, and the Company’s contractual involvement with the entity. The Company continually reviews and reconsiders its controlling\ninterest, VIE or VRE conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events, such as changes to its ownership interest, or amendments to contract documents.\nThe Company performs its consolidation analysis at the individual Fund level and has concluded that the Funds are VREs because the structure of the Funds is\nsuch that the shareholders are deemed to have the power through voting rights to direct the activities that most significantly impact each Fund’s economic\nperformance. The Funds are consolidated if DHIL ownership, directly or indirectly, represents a majority interest (greater than 50%). The Company records\nredeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated investments for which the Company’s ownership is less than 100%. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany has not consolidated any of the Funds. As of December 31, 2022, the Company consolidated the Diamond Hill International Fund. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company consolidated the Diamond Hill International Fund and the Diamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund. The Company\ndeconsolidated the Diamond Hill International Fund during the\n46\nTable of Contents\nyear ended December 31, 2023 and deconsolidated the Diamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund during the year ended December 31, 2022, as the\nCompany’s ownership declined to less than 50% during each of these years. The Company also deconsolidated the Diamond Hill Global Fund during the year\nended December 31, 2021, as the Fund was liquidated on December 17, 2021. The Fund(s) consolidated during the applicable period are referred to as the\n“Consolidated Fund(s).”\nDHCM is the investment advisor of DHMF and is the managing member of Diamond Hill Fund GP, LLC (the “General Partner”), which is the general partner\nof DHMF. DHCM is wholly-owned by, and consolidated with, DHIL. Further, through its control of the General Partner, DHCM has the power to direct\nDHMF’s economic activities and the right to receive investment advisory fees from DHMF that may be significant. DHMF commenced operations on June 1,\n2021, and its underlying assets consist primarily of marketable securities.\nThe Company concluded DHMF was a VIE given that: (i) DHCM has disproportionately less voting interest than economic interest, and (ii) DHMF’s limited\npartners have full power to remove the General Partner (which is controlled by DHCM, which is controlled by DHIL) due to the existence of substantive kick-\nout rights. In addition, substantially all of DHMF’s activities are conducted on behalf of the General Partner, which has disproportionately few voting rights.\nThe Company concluded it is not the primary beneficiary of DHMF as it lacks the power to control DHMF, since DHMF’s limited partners have single-party\nkick-out rights and can unilaterally remove the General Partner without cause. DHCM’s investments in DHMF are reported as a component of the Company’s\ninvestment portfolio and valued at DHCM’s respective share of DHMF's net income or loss.\nGains and losses attributable to changes in the value of DHCM’s interests in DHMF are included in the Company’s reported investment income. The\nCompany’s exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with DHMF is limited to the amount of its investment. DHCM is not obligated to provide, and has\nnot provided, financial or other support to DHMF, except for its investments to date and its contractually provided investment advisory responsibilities. The\nCompany has not provided liquidity arrangements, guarantees, or other commitments to support DHMF’s operations, and DHMF’s creditors and interest\nholders have no recourse to the general credit of the Company.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest represents third-party interests in the Consolidated Funds. This interest is redeemable at the option of the investors, and\ntherefore, is not treated as permanent equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is recorded at redemption value, which approximates the fair value each\nreporting period.\nSegment Information\nManagement has determined that the Company operates in a single business segment, which is providing investment advisory and related services to clients\nthrough pooled vehicles, including the Funds and DHMF, separately managed accounts, CITs, other pooled vehicles including sub-advised funds, and model\ndelivery programs. Therefore, the Company does not present disclosures relating to operating segments in annual or interim financial statements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and money market mutual funds held by DHCM. The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash\ninstruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash on deposit with U.S. financial institutions\nthat are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. The Company’s credit risk in the event of failure of these financial\ninstitutions is represented by the difference between the FDIC limit and the total amount on deposit. Management monitors the financial institutions’\ncreditworthiness in conjunction with balances on deposit to minimize risk. The Company from time to time may have amounts on deposit in excess of the\ninsured limits. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $2.8 million and $44.2 million in demand deposits and money market mutual funds, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $2.8 million and $60.4 million in demand deposits and money market mutual funds, respectively.\n47\nTable of Contents\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company records accounts receivable when they are due and presents them on the balance sheet net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts\nreceivable are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible. Any allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the Company’s historical\nlosses, existing conditions in the industry, and the financial stability of the individual or entity that owes the receivable. No allowance for doubtful accounts\nwas deemed necessary at either December 31, 2023 or 2022. Accounts receivable from the Funds were $9.1 million and $9.3 million as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\nInvestments\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of the Company’s investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates its determination for each\nreporting period.\nCompany sponsored investments, where the Company has neither the control nor the ability to exercise significant influence, as well as securities held in the\nConsolidated Funds, are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as investment income (loss) in the\nCompany's consolidated statements of income.\nInvestments classified as equity method investments represent investments in which the Company owns 20% to 50% of the outstanding voting interests in the\nentity or where it is determined that the Company is able to exercise significant influence but not control over the investments. When using the equity method,\nthe Company recognizes its respective share of the investee’s net income or loss for the period, which is recorded as investment income (loss) in the\nCompany’s consolidated statements of income.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, consisting of leasehold improvements, right-of-use lease assets, computer equipment, capitalized software, furniture, and fixtures are\ncarried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Accumulated depreciation was $10.2 million and $8.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets.\nImplementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software, including hosting arrangements, are capitalized and expensed on a straight-line basis\nover either the estimated useful life of the respective software or the term of the hosting arrangement.\nProperty and equipment is tested for impairment when there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When an asset is\ndetermined to not be recoverable, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess, if any, of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.\nRevenue Recognition – General\nThe Company recognizes revenue when DHCM satisfies performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a client. The Company earns substantially\nall of its revenue from DHCM investment advisory and fund administration contracts. Investment advisory and fund administration fees, generally calculated\nas a percentage of AUM, are recorded as revenue as services are performed. In addition to fixed fees based on a percentage of AUM, certain client accounts\nalso provide periodic performance-based fees.\nRevenue from contracts with clients that was earned during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 include:\n48\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nMutual fund\nInvestment advisory Total revenue\nadministration, net\nDiamond Hill Funds $ 84,810,452 $ 7,536,871 $ 92,347,323\nSeparately managed accounts, excluding performance-\nbased fees 24,898,695 — 24,898,695\nPerformance-based fees 1,176,351 — 1,176,351\nOther pooled vehicles 9,261,533 — 9,261,533\nModel delivery 5,211,113 — 5,211,113\nCollective investment trusts 3,821,356 — 3,821,356\n$ 129,179,500 $ 7,536,871 $ 136,716,371\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nMutual fund\nInvestment advisory Total revenue\nadministration, net\nDiamond Hill Funds $ 98,873,571 $ 10,170,502 $ 109,044,073\nSeparately managed accounts, excluding performance-\nbased fees 26,200,724 — 26,200,724\nPerformance-based fees 1,500,225 — 1,500,225\nOther pooled vehicles 9,410,541 — 9,410,541\nModel delivery 5,910,061 — 5,910,061\nCollective investment trusts 2,430,395 — 2,430,395\n$ 144,325,517 $ 10,170,502 $ 154,496,019\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nMutual fund\nInvestment advisory Total revenue\nadministration, net\nDiamond Hill Funds $ 113,602,317 $ 12,056,228 $ 125,658,545\nSeparately managed accounts, excluding performance-\nbased fees 27,882,488 — 27,882,488\nPerformance-based fees 11,860,051 — 11,860,051\nOther pooled vehicles 10,166,928 — 10,166,928\nModel delivery 4,977,234 — 4,977,234\nCollective investment trusts 1,648,591 — 1,648,591\n$ 170,137,609 $ 12,056,228 $ 182,193,837\nRevenue Recognition – Investment Advisory Fees\nDHCM’s investment advisory contracts with clients have a single performance obligation because the contracted services are not separately identifiable from\nother obligations in the contracts, and therefore, are not distinct. All obligations to provide investment advisory services are satisfied over time by DHCM.\nThe fees DHCM receives for its services under its investment advisory contracts are based on AUM, which changes based on the value of securities held under\neach investment advisory contract. These fees are thereby constrained and represent variable consideration, and they are excluded from revenue until the AUM\non which DHCM’s client is billed is no longer subject to market fluctuations.\nDHCM also provides its strategy model portfolios and related services to sponsors of model delivery programs. For its services, DHCM is paid a model\ndelivery fee by the program sponsor at a pre-determined rate based on the amount of AUA in the program.\n49\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition – Performance-Based Fees\nDHCM manages certain client accounts that pay performance-based fees. These fees are calculated based on client investment results over rolling five-year\nperiods. The Company records performance-based fees when it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue will not occur. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recorded $1.2 million, $1.5 million, and $11.9 million, respectively, in performance-based fees. The\nCompany recorded $11.9 million of performance-based fees during the year ended December 31, 2021, as a significant performance-based agreement reached\nthe end of its first five-year measurement period on September 30, 2021. After the initial five-year contract measurement term, the performance-based fee is\ncalculated annually based on the client investment results over the recently completed five-year period. The Company’s next performance measurement period\nwill be the twelve months ending September 30, 2024. AUM subject to performance-based fees was approximately $518.9 million as of December 31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition – Mutual Fund Administration\nDHCM has an administrative and transfer agency services agreement with the Funds under which DHCM performs certain services for each Fund. These\nservices include performance obligations such as mutual fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agency, and other related functions. These services are\nperformed concurrently under DHCM’s agreement with the Funds, all performance obligations to provide these administrative services are satisfied over time,\nand the Company recognizes the related revenue as time progresses. Each Fund pays DHCM a fee for performing these services, which is calculated using an\nannual rate multiplied by the average daily net assets of each respective Fund share class. These fees are thereby constrained and represent variable\nconsideration, and they are excluded from revenue until the AUM on which DHCM bills the Funds is no longer subject to market fluctuations.\nThe Funds have selected and contractually engaged certain vendors to fulfill various services to benefit the Funds’ shareholders or to satisfy regulatory\nrequirements of the Funds. These services include, among others, required shareholder mailings, federal and state registrations, and legal and audit services. In\nfulfilling a portion of its role under the administration and transfer agency services agreement with the Funds, DHCM acts as agent and pays for these services\non behalf of the Funds. Each vendor is independently responsible for fulfillment of the services it has been engaged to provide and negotiates its fees and terms\ndirectly with the Funds’ management and board of trustees. Each year, the Funds’ board of trustees reviews the fee that each Fund pays to DHCM, and\nspecifically considers the contractual expenses that DHCM pays on behalf of the Funds. As a result, DHCM is not involved in the delivery or pricing of these\nservices, and bears no risk related to these services. Revenue has been recorded net of these Fund-related expenses.\nMutual fund administration gross and net revenue are summarized below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nMutual fund administration:\nAdministration revenue, gross $ 21,597,721 $ 25,188,386 $ 29,635,451\nFund related expense (14,060,850) (15,017,884) (17,579,223)\nMutual fund administration revenue, net $ 7,536,871 $ 10,170,502 $ 12,056,228\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for current and deferred income taxes through an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible\ntemporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance\nwhen it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the\neffects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nThe Company is subject to examination by federal and applicable state and local jurisdictions for various tax periods. The Company’s income tax positions are\nbased on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business. Due to the subjectivity of\ninterpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws among those jurisdictions, and the inherent uncertainty in\nestimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, the Company’s estimates of income tax liabilities may differ materially from actual payments or\nassessments. The Company regularly assesses its positions with regard to tax exposures and records liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and related\ninterest and penalties, if any, according to the principles of Financial Accounting Standards\n50\nTable of Contents\nBoard (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes. The Company records interest and penalties within income tax expense on\nthe income statement. See Note 9.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) are computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of DHIL common shares outstanding for the period, which includes unvested restricted shares. See Note 10.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nThe Company did not adopt any new accounting guidance during the year ended December 31, 2023 that had a material effect on its financial position or\nresults of operations.\nNewly Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Guidance\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This update requires\ncertain revisions to income tax disclosures, primarily disclosures related to rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for financial\nstatements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not believe that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will materially impact\nits financial statements.\nNote 3 Investments\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company’s investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nFair value investments:\nSecurities held in Consolidated Funds(a) — $ 54,740,993\nCompany-sponsored investments $ 63,208,573 66,828,910\nCompany-sponsored equity method investments 84,530,289 24,105,808\nTotal Investments $ 147,738,862 $ 145,675,711\n(a) Of the securities held in the Consolidated Funds as of December 31, 2022, DHCM directly held $37.5 million and non-controlling shareholders held $17.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company did not consolidate any of the Funds.

The Company may settle the 401(k) plan matching contributions in cash or common shares of the Company.\nAfter June 1, 2023, the Company made all matching contributions in cash. Employees vest ratably in the matching contributions over a five year period.

Participants are responsible for designating investment options for the assets they contribute, and the distribution paid to each participant\nreflects any gains or losses on the assets realized in connection with the Deferred Compensation Plans. Assets held in the Deferred Compensation Plans are\nincluded in the Company’s investment portfolio, and the associated obligation to participants is included in deferred compensation liability. Deferred\ncompensation liability was $36.1 million and $30.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 8 Operating Leases\nThe Company currently leases office space of approximately 37,829 square feet at one location.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of this right-of-use asset, which is included in property and equipment, was\napproximately $0.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, net of deferred rent on the consolidated balance sheets.

These annual operating expenses were\napproximately $0.4 million in each of 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n56\nTable of Contents\nNote 9 Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent federal income tax provision $ 9,974,451 $ 14,494,857 $ 20,987,801\nCurrent state and local income tax provision 2,731,661 4,119,580 6,472,120\nDeferred income tax expense (benefit) 2,783,768 (4,526,654) (1,410,106)\nProvision for income taxes $ 15,489,880 $ 14,087,783 $ 26,049,815\nThe following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate:\n2023 2022 2021\nStatutory U.S. federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState and local income taxes, net of federal benefit 4.7 4.7 4.8\nInternal revenue code section 162 limitations 1.3 1.5 0.9\nExcess tax deficit on vesting of restricted stock 0.3 0.1 0.1\nIncome tax benefit from dividends paid on restricted stock (0.5) (0.9) (1.0)\nOther — (0.6) 0.2\nUnconsolidated effective income tax rate 26.8 % 25.8 % 26.0 %\nImpact attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest (a) (0.4) 1.8 (0.4)\nEffective income tax rate 26.4 % 27.6 % 25.6 %\n(a) The provision for income taxes includes expense (benefit) attributable to the fact that the Company’s operations include the Consolidated Funds, which are not subject to\nfederal income taxes. Accordingly, a portion of the Company’s earnings are not subject to corporate tax levels.\nDeferred income taxes and benefits arise from temporary differences between taxable income for financial statement and income tax return purposes. Net\ndeferred tax assets consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\nStock-based compensation $ 2,778,585 $ 3,416,038\nAccrued compensation 10,715,239 9,297,425\nUnrealized (gains) losses (1,487,350) 2,362,688\nProperty and equipment (422,062) (712,794)\nOther assets and liabilities 6,026 10,849\nNet deferred tax assets $ 11,590,438 $ 14,374,206\nThe net temporary differences incurred to date will reverse in future periods as the Company generates taxable earnings. The Company believes it is more\nlikely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded. The Company records\na valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2023, no\nvaluation allowance was deemed necessary.\nFASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax\nposition taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim\nperiods, disclosure and transition. The Company recognizes tax benefits related to positions taken, or expected to be taken, on its tax returns, only if the\npositions are “more-likely-than-not” sustainable. Once this threshold has been met, the Company’s measurement of its expected tax benefits is recognized in its\nfinancial statements. The Company did not record an accrual for tax-related uncertainties or unrecognized tax positions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The Company does not expect a change to the reserve for uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months that would have a material impact\non the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and the taxing authorities of various states. Generally, the\nCompany is subject to federal, state, and local examinations by tax authorities for the tax years ended December 31, 2019 through 2023.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNote 10 Earnings Per Share\nThe Company’s common shares outstanding consist of all shares issued and outstanding, including unvested restricted shares. Basic and diluted EPS are\ncalculated under the two-class method. The following table sets forth the computation for basic and diluted EPS and reconciliation between basic and diluted\nshares outstanding:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income $ 43,085,548 $ 36,870,762 $ 75,589,539\nLess: Net loss (income) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest (859,126) 3,563,345 (1,388,930)\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 42,226,422 $ 40,434,107 $ 74,200,609\nWeighted average number of outstanding shares - Basic 2,948,625 3,107,604 3,179,497\nWeighted average number of outstanding shares - Diluted 2,948,625 3,107,604 3,179,497\nEarnings per share attributable to common shareholders\nBasic $ 14.32 $ 13.01 $ 23.34\nDiluted $ 14.32 $ 13.01 $ 23.34\nNote 11 Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company indemnifies its directors, officers, and certain employees for certain liabilities that may arise from the performance of their duties to the\nCompany. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries may be involved in legal matters incidental to its business. There are currently no such legal\nmatters pending that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, litigation involves an element\nof uncertainty, and future developments could cause legal actions or claims to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,\nand liquidity.\nAdditionally, in the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that contain a variety of representations and\nwarranties and that provide indemnification obligations. Certain agreements do not contain any limits on the Company’s liability and could involve future\nclaims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate the Company’s potential liability under these\nindemnities. Further, the Company maintains insurance policies that may provide full or partial coverage against certain of these liabilities.\nNote 12 Sale of the High Yield-Focused Investment Advisory Contracts\nDHCM entered into an asset purchase agreement dated February 2, 2021 (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Brandywine Global, a specialist investment\nmanager of Franklin Resources, Inc. The transaction closed on July 30, 2021, at which time Brandywine Global acquired the High Yield-Focused Advisory\nContracts. After the closing, the Corporate Credit Fund and the High Yield Fund were renamed as the BrandywineGLOBAL Corporate Credit Fund and the\nBrandywineGLOBAL High Yield Fund (the “High Yield-Focused Funds”).\nDHCM determined the gain on this transaction in accordance with FASB ASC 610-20, Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets.\nDHCM received an initial cash payment at closing of $9.0 million, which was included in gain on sale of High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts in the\nconsolidated statements of income during the third quarter of 2021.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase Agreement, DHCM received an additional payment of $6.8 million based on the net revenue of the High Yield-Focused Funds\non July 30, 2022, effectively closing the transaction. The additional payment was included in gain on sale of High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts in the\nconsolidated statements of income during the third quarter of 2022.\n58\nTable of Contents\nNote 13 Subsequent Events\nOn February 28, 2024, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $1.50 per share, payable on March 22, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 11,\n2024.\nITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K (the\n“Evaluation Date”). Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files\nor submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to\nensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited the Company’s 2023 and 2022 consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Form 10-K and the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, and has issued its Report of Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this\nForm 10-K.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nThere are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human error and the possible circumvention or overriding\nof controls and procedures. Additionally, judgments in decision-making may be faulty and breakdowns may occur because of a simple error or mistake. An\neffective control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met. Accordingly,\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the control system can prevent or detect all errors or\nfraud. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n59\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nDiamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the\nconsolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 29, 2024\nITEM 9B.

BRILLIANT\nThis Amendment No. 2 is entered into as of the 14th day of November 2023 (this “Amendment”) to amend the Employment\nAgreement, dated October 26, 2021 (as amended as of March 31, 2023, the “Agreement”), by and between Diamond Hill Capital\nManagement, Inc.

All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Agreement. All\nother provisions, terms and conditions contained in the Agreement, as amended to date, shall remain in full force and effect.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Amendment to be executed by their duly authorized officers or agents to\nbecome effective as of the day and year set forth above.\nDIAMOND HILL CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nBy:\nTitle:\nDate: November 14, 2023\nHEATHER E. BRILLIANT\nBy:\nDate: November 14, 2023\n2\nINDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT\nThis Indemnification Agreement, dated as of [ ] (this “Agreement”), is made by and between Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc., an\nOhio corporation (the “Company”), and [ ] (“Indemnitee”).\nRECITALS:\nA. The Ohio Revised Code (the “ORC”) provides that, except where the law, the articles, or the regulations require action to be\nauthorized or taken by shareholders, all of the authority of a corporation shall be exercised by or under the direction of its directors.\nB. It is critically important to the Company and its shareholders that the Company be able to attract and retain the most capable\npersons reasonably available to serve as directors and officers of the Company and its affiliates.\nC. There is growing incidence of litigation against directors and officers of public companies, and recent legislative initiatives have\nincreasingly exposed directors and officers to new and broader civil liability as well as an increased risk of criminal proceedings.\nD. In recognition of the need for corporations to be able to attract and retain capable persons to serve as directors and officers, the ORC\nauthorizes corporations to indemnify and maintain liability insurance for their directors and officers.\nE. The ORC and the Company’s Regulations (the “Regulations”) provide for indemnification of directors and officers of the\nCompany, and the Company currently maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.\nF. The Board has evaluated the sufficiency of the ORC, the Regulations and the liability insurance as to their adequacy to protect\ndirectors and officers against the various legal risks and potential liabilities associated with their serving as directors or officers of the Company\nand its affiliates, and the Board has concluded that the ORC, the Regulations and liability insurance may not provide adequate protection under\ncertain circumstances.\nG. Therefore, in order to induce existing directors and officers to continue to serve in such capacity, to induce new directors and\nofficers to serve in such capacity and to enhance directors’ and officers’ ability to serve the Company and its affiliates in an effective manner, the\nBoard has concluded that director and officer indemnification agreements are necessary and advisable.\nH.

In all other\ncases the applicability of Section 3(d)(i), (ii) or (iii) shall be determined under Section 4 and, pending such determination, Indemnifiable\nExpenses shall be advanced subject to the provisions of this Section 3.

Determination of Right to Indemnification.\n(a) To the extent that Indemnitee shall have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Indemnifiable\nClaim or in defense of any claims, issues or matters that are part of an Indemnifiable Claim, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Losses\nand Indemnifiable Expenses relating to, arising out of or resulting from such Indemnifiable Claim or any such claims, issues or matters in\naccordance with Section 2, and no Indemnification Determination (as defined in Section 4(b)) shall be required. For purposes of this Section 4(a)\nand without limitation, the termination of any Indemnifiable Claim or any such claim, issue or matter by dismissal, with or without prejudice,\nshall be deemed to be a success on the merits.\n(b) To the extent that the provisions of Section 4(a) are inapplicable to an Indemnifiable Claim (or of any part thereof) that\nhas been finally disposed of, Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification against Indemnifiable Losses and Indemnifiable Expenses unless\nand to the extent that:\n(i) a court of competent jurisdiction has made a finding in a final unappealable judgment as to the acts or\nomissions of Indemnitee which, when applied under Section 2(b)(i), (ii) or (iii), and/or Section 3(d)(i), (ii) or (iii), would result in a denial of\nindemnification; or\n(ii) to the extent Section 4(b)(i) does not apply, it is determined pursuant to Section 4(c) below (an\n\"Indemnification Determination\") that a Loss and/or Expense is not indemnifiable pursuant to the application of Section 2(b)(i), (ii) or (iii)\nand/or Section 3(d)(i), (ii) or (iii).\n(c) An Indemnification Determination shall be made as provided for in this Section 4(c) and Sections 4(d), (e), (f), (g), (h)\nand (i):\n(i) if a Change in Control has not occurred, or if a Change in Control has occurred but Indemnitee requests that the\nIndemnification Determination be made be made pursuant to this clause (i), (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, (B) if the\nDisinterested Directors so direct, by a majority vote of a committee of Disinterested Directors, or (C) if a majority of Disinterested Directors is\nnot available or if a majority so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to\nIndemnitee; and\n(ii) if a Change in Control has occurred and Indemnitee has not requested that the Indemnification Determination\nbe made pursuant to clause (i), by Independent Counsel in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to\nIndemnitee.\nIndemnitee will cooperate with the person or persons selected pursuant to section 4(c) to make such Indemnification Determination (such\nperson or persons, the \"Reviewer\"), including providing to the Reviewer, upon reasonable advance request, any documentation or information\nwhich is not privileged or\n5\notherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. The\nCompany shall reimburse Indemnitee and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall advance to Indemnitee, within five business days of such request,\nany and all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Reviewer.\nThe Reviewer shall make the Indemnification Determination reasonably and in good faith consistent with the terms of this Agreement.\n(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Indemnification Determination required under Section\n4(c) to be made as promptly as practicable. If (i) the Reviewer has not made a determination within 60 days after the later of (A) receipt by the\nCompany of written notice from Indemnitee advising the Company of the final disposition of the applicable Indemnifiable Claim and (B) the final\nselection of an Independent Counsel (if such determination is to be made by Independent Counsel) and (ii) Indemnitee shall have fulfilled\nhis/her obligations to provide information to and cooperate with the Reviewer pursuant to Section 4(c), then Indemnitee shall be deemed to be\nentitled to indemnification in respect of the Loss or Expense at issue.\n(e) If (i) Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 4(a), or (ii) Indemnitee has been determined or\ndeemed pursuant to Section 4(b), 4(c) or 4(d) to be entitled to indemnification, then the Company shall pay to Indemnitee, within five business\ndays of the last to occur of preceding clauses (i) and (ii), an amount equal to the unpaid amount of Indemnifiable Losses and Indemnifiable\nExpenses indemnified hereunder.\n(f) If an Indemnification Determination is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 4(c)(i), the Independent\nCounsel shall be selected by the Company, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him or her of the identity of the\nIndependent Counsel so selected. If an Indemnification Determination is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii), the\nIndependent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee, and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the\nIndependent Counsel so selected. In either case, Indemnitee or the Company, as applicable, may, within five business days after receiving written\nnotice of selection from the other, deliver to the other a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be\nasserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not satisfy the criteria set forth in the definition of “Independent\nCounsel” in Section 1(j), and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely\nobjection, the person or firm so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is properly and timely made and\nsubstantiated, (i) the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a\ncourt has determined that such objection is without merit and (ii) the non-objecting party may, at its option, select an alternative Independent\nCounsel and give written notice to the other party advising such other party of the identity of the alternative Independent Counsel so selected, in\nwhich case the provisions of the two immediately preceding sentences and clause (i) of this sentence shall apply to any such subsequent selection.\nIf no Independent Counsel that is permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(f) to make the Indemnification Determination shall\nhave been selected within [30] days after the Company gives its initial notice pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 4(f) or Indemnitee\ngives its initial notice pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 4(f), as the case may be, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other’s selection\nof Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel by the Court. In all events, the Company shall pay all of the\nreasonable fees and expenses of the Independent Counsel incurred in connection with the Independent Counsel’s determination pursuant to\nSection 4(c).\n(g) In making any Indemnification Determination, the Reviewer shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to\nindemnification, and the Company may overcome such presumption only by its producing clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement, it shall be presumed that: (i) Indemnitee acted in good faith and\nin a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; (ii) with respect to any criminal\naction or proceeding, Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to\n6\nbelieve that Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful; and (iii) each Loss and Expense for which indemnification is claimed was actually and\nreasonably incurred by Indemnitee. The termination of any Indemnifiable Claim against Indemnitee by judgment, order, settlement (whether\nwith or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee\nis not entitled to indemnification, that indemnification hereunder is otherwise not permitted or otherwise adversely affect the right of the\nIndemnitee to indemnification. In addition, in making any Indemnification Determination, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have satisfied the\nStandard of Conduct if Indemnitee’s act or omission is based on Indemnitee’s reliance on information, opinions, reports or statements, including\nfinancial statements and other financial data, that were prepared or presented by (i) one or more directors, officers, or employees of the\nCompany who the Indemnitee reasonably believes are reliable and competent in the matters prepared or presented; (ii) counsel, public\naccountants, or other persons as to matters that the Indemnitee reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence;\nor (iii) a committee of the Board upon which the Indemnitee does not serve, duly established in accordance with a provision of the Company’s\nConstituent Documents, as to matters within its designated authority, which committee the Indemnitee reasonably believes to merit confidence.\nIn addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not be imputed\nto Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.\n(h) Any Indemnification Determination that is adverse to Indemnitee may be challenged by Indemnitee in the Court of\nCommon Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio, and any such judicial proceeding shall be a de novo review on the merits.\n(i) Any Indemnification Determination favorable to Indemnitee finding that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall\nbe binding on the Company and shall not be challenged by the Company except to the extent that the Company has determined that any such\nindemnification is prohibited by law or is otherwise unlawful.\n(j) If the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnity by the Company for some or a portion of Losses or Expenses incurred by him\nor her, but not for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such Losses or Expenses\nto which the Indemnitee is entitled.\n5. Notices; Defense of Claims.\n(a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement in respect of an Indemnifiable Claim, Indemnitee shall submit to the\nCompany a written request, including a brief description (based upon information then available to Indemnitee) of such Indemnifiable Claim. If,\nat the time of the receipt of such request, the Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect under which coverage for such\nIndemnifiable Claim is potentially available, the Company shall give prompt written notice of such Indemnifiable Claim to the applicable\ninsurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable policies. The Company shall provide to Indemnitee a copy of such notice\ndelivered to the applicable insurers, and copies of all subsequent correspondence between the Company and such insurers regarding the\nIndemnifiable Claim, in each case substantially concurrently with the delivery or receipt thereof by the Company. The failure by Indemnitee to\ntimely notify the Company of any Indemnifiable Claim shall not relieve the Company from any liability hereunder unless, the Company did not\notherwise learn of such Indemnifiable Claim and such failure results in forfeiture by the Company of substantial defenses, rights or insurance\ncoverage.\n(b) The Company shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnifiable Claim, and at the request of Indemnitee the\nCompany shall assume the defense of any Indemnifiable Claim, with, in either case, counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee; provided\nthat the Company shall not have the right or obligation to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Company; and\nprovided further that if Indemnitee or the Company determines, in good faith, that (i) the use of counsel chosen by the Company to represent\nIndemnitee would present such counsel with an actual or potential conflict, (ii) the named parties in any such Indemnifiable Claim (including\nany impleaded parties) include both the Company and Indemnitee and there may be one or more legal defenses available to Indemnitee that are\ndifferent from or in addition to those available to the Company, or (iii) any such representation by such counsel would be precluded under the\napplicable standards of professional\n7\nconduct then prevailing, then the Company shall not have the right, nor the obligation, to assume the defense of such Indemnifiable Claim and\nIndemnitee shall be entitled to retain separate counsel (but not more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel in respect of any\nIndemnifiable Claim) at the Company’s expense. With respect to any Indemnifiable Claim the defense of which has been assumed by the\nCompany: (i) the Company shall conduct the defense and/or settlement thereof diligently and in good faith, (ii) the Company shall keep\nIndemnitee reasonably informed regarding the status of such defense and any settlement, (iii) Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the\nCompany in the defense of or otherwise responding to any Indemnifiable Claim, and (iv) Indemnitee may participate (at his or her own expense)\nin such defense.\n(c) The Company shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any\nIndemnifiable Claim effected without the Company’s prior written consent. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the\nIndemnitee, effect any settlement of any threatened or pending Indemnifiable Claim to which the Indemnitee is a party unless such settlement\nsolely involves the payment of money and includes a complete and unconditional release of Indemnitee from all liability on any claims that are or\ncould be the subject matter of such Indemnifiable Claim. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold or delay its consent\nto any proposed settlement; provided that Indemnitee may withhold consent to any settlement that provides for other than solely the payment of\nmoney or does not provide such complete and unconditional release of Indemnitee.\n(d) This Section 5 is subject to the requirements of any applicable policy of liability insurance which gives the insurer the right\nto approve or consent to counsel.\n6. Enforcement by Indemnitee.\n(a) It is the intent of the Company that Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees and or other Expenses associated with\nthe interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense\nthereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to Indemnitee hereunder. Accordingly, without limiting the\ngenerality or effect of any other provision hereof, if: (i) Indemnitee determines in good faith that the Company has failed to comply with any of\nits obligations under this Agreement (ii) the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or\nunenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding which may result in the denial to, or the recovery from, Indemnitee the\nbenefits provided or intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder; or (iii) Indemnitee takes legal action to enforce any Indemnitee rights\nunder any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, then the Company irrevocably authorizes the\nIndemnitee from time to time to retain counsel of Indemnitee’s choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided, to advise and\nrepresent Indemnitee in connection with any such interpretation, enforcement, defense or action.\n(b) The Company shall, if requested by Indemnitee, reimburse Indemnitee for, or advance to Indemnitee, within five business\ndays of such request, any and all Expenses reasonably paid or incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any claim, defense or action by\nIndemnitee in respect of Section 6(a)(i), (ii) or (iii). For purposes of obtaining payments of Expenses in advance of final disposition, the\nIndemnitee shall submit to the Company a sworn undertaking substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto. Such undertaking to repay\nExpenses need not be secured and the Company must accept the undertaking without reference to Indemnitee’s ability to repay the Expenses.\n(c) Indemnitee shall repay to the Company all Expenses paid to or on behalf of Indemnitee under this Section 6 if it is\ndetermined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment that the material claims or defenses asserted by Indemnitee\npursuant to Section 6(a) were made in bad faith or were frivolous.\n7. Liability Insurance. The Company in its discretion may cause to be maintained in effect policies of directors’ and officers’ liability\ninsurance providing coverage for directors and officers of the Company. Upon request, the Company shall provide Indemnitee with a copy of all\ndirectors’ and officers’ liability insurance applications, binders, policies, declarations, endorsements and other related materials. Indemnitee\nshall continue to be entitled to the indemnification rights provided under this Agreement regardless of whether liability or other insurance\ncoverage is at any time obtained or retained by the Company or the extent or amount of any such coverage.\n8. Non-Exclusivity; No Duplication.\n8\n(a) The rights of Indemnitee hereunder will be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the ORC, the\nConstituent Documents, any policy of insurance or under any other contract or otherwise (collectively, “Other Indemnity Provisions”);\nprovided, however, that (i) to the extent that any change or interpretation is made to any applicable law which permits any greater right to\nindemnification than that provided under this Agreement as of the date hereof, Indemnitee will be deemed to have such greater right hereunder,\nand (ii) if there is any change in any applicable law which narrows the right of the Company to indemnify Indemnitee, such changes, to the extent\nnot otherwise required by applicable law to be applied to this Agreement, shall have no effect on this Agreement or the parties' rights and\nobligations hereunder.\n(b) The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment to Indemnitee in respect of any Indemnifiable\nLosses or Indemnifiable Expenses to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (net of Expenses incurred in connection\ntherewith) under any Other Indemnity Provisions or otherwise (including from any Other Enterprise) in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses or\nIndemnifiable Expenses otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. Indemnitee shall repay any Expenses actually advanced to Indemnitee that, at the\nfinal disposition of the matter to which the advance related, were in excess of Expenses actually paid by Indemnitee in respect of such matter.\n9. Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all\nof the related rights of recovery of Indemnitee against other persons or entities.

Without limiting the preceding sentence, the Company shall require any successor or successors (whether direct or indirect, by asset\npurchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise), by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee and his or her\ncounsel, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to\nperform if no such succession had taken place.

In the event that any court or other adjudicative body shall decline to reform\nany provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence,\nthe parties thereto shall take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to replace the provision so held to be invalid, unenforceable or\notherwise illegal with one or more alternative provisions that effectuate the purpose and intent of the original provisions of this Agreement as\nfully as possible without being invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal.\n14. Amendments and Waivers.

Specific Performance.

Line\nTitle: Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nDate: February 29, 2024\nDiamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.\nExecutive Officer Compensation Recoupment and Restitution Policy\nAs of October 2, 2023\nThis Policy has been adopted by the Board as of the Effective Date. This Policy provides for the recovery of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation from Executive Officers in the event of an Accounting Restatement. This Policy is intended to comply with, and shall\nbe interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Rule. Capitalized terms used in\nthis Policy have the respective meanings given to them in Section 1 below.\n1. Definitions. For purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms have the meanings set forth below.\nA. “Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the\nmaterial noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including\nany required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the\npreviously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in\nthe current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\nB. “Accounting Restatement Date” means the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the\nofficer(s) of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably\nshould have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; and (ii) the date a court,\nregulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\nC. “Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company.\nD. “Clawback Period” means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the\nCompany immediately preceding the Accounting Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a\nchange in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed\nfiscal years.\nE. “Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nF. “Committee” means the Compensation Committee of the Board.\nG. “Company” means Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc., an Ohio corporation.\nH. “Effective Date” means October 2, 2023.\nI. “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Incentive-\nBased Compensation received by an Executive Officer during the Clawback Period that exceeds the amount of\nIncentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received by such Executive Officer had the Incentive-\nBased Compensation been determined based on the restated amounts in such Accounting Restatement. The amount of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation shall be computed without regard to any taxes paid by the relevant Executive\nOfficer (including any taxes withheld by the Company from the Incentive-Based Compensation paid to such\nExecutive Officer). For Incentive-Based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock\n1\nprice or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to\nmathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement: (i) the Committee must\ndetermine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation related to such Incentive-Based Compensation by\nmaking a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total stockholder\nreturn upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (ii) the Company must maintain\ndocumentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq.\nJ. “Exchange Act” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nK. “Executive Officer” means the Company’s current and former president, principal financial officer, principal\naccounting officer (or if there is not such accounting officer, the controller), any vice president in charge of a principal\nbusiness unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a\npolicy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company.\nExecutive Officers of the Company’s parents or subsidiaries are deemed Executive Officers of the Company if they\nperform such policy-making functions for the Company. The term “policy-making function” is not intended to\ninclude policy-making functions that are not significant. Identification of an Executive Officer for purposes of this\nPolicy includes individuals deemed to be Executive Officers by the Board and/or the Committee and those executive\nofficers identified by the Company pursuant to 17 CFR 229.401(b).\nL. “Financial Reporting Measure” means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the\naccounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly\nor in part from such measure. A financial reporting measure is not required to be presented within the Company’s\nfinancial statements or included in a filing with the SEC to qualify as a Financial Reporting Measure. For purposes of\nthis Policy, Financial Reporting Measure includes, but is not limited to, stock price and total stockholder return.\nM. “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part\nupon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\nN. “Listing Rule” means Nasdaq Rule 5608.\nO. “Nasdaq” means The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nP. “Policy” means this Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. Executive Officer Compensation Recoupment and\nRestitution Policy, as the same may be amended pursuant to the terms hereof.\nQ. “Rule 10D-1” means Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nR. “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n2. Policy Administration. This Policy will be administered and interpreted by the Committee. The Committee is authorized to\nmake all determinations under this Policy to the extent permitted by the Listing Rule and in compliance with Section 409A of\nthe\n2\nCode. All determinations made by the Committee pursuant to this Policy will be final and binding on all persons, including\nthe Company and its affiliates, shareholders, and Executive Officers, and need not be uniform with respect to each individual\nsubject to the Policy.\n3. Policy Application. This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person: (a) after beginning\nservice as an Executive Officer; (b) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such\nIncentive-Based Compensation; (c) while the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a\nnational securities association; and (d) during the Clawback Period. For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based\nCompensation is considered “received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the relevant Financial Reporting\nMeasure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-\nBased Compensation occurs after the end of that period. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of this Policy apply to any\nIncentive-Based Compensation received by Executive Officers on or after the Effective Date even if such Incentive-Based\nCompensation was approved, awarded, granted, or paid to Executive Officers before the Effective Date.\n4. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation. In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall\nreasonably promptly determine and recover the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by any\nExecutive Officer, as determined pursuant to this Policy. The Committee shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion,\nthe timing and method for recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation, to the extent permitted under the Listing Rule\nand in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code, which may include\nwithout limitation: (a) seeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity-based award; (b) cancelling prior cash or\nequity-based awards; (c) canceling or offsetting against any future payable or planned compensation (including, without\nlimitation, base salary or cash or equity-based awards); (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation; and (e) any other method\nauthorized by applicable law or contract.\nA. The Company’s recovery obligation pursuant to this Section 4 shall not apply if any of the following conditions are\nmet and the Committee determines that such recovery would be impracticable:\ni. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be\nrecovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover\nsuch Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that\ndocumentation to Nasdaq;\nii. Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before\nconcluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nbased on violation of home country law, the Company must obtain an opinion of home country counsel,\nacceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation, and provide a copy of the opinion to\nNasdaq; or\niii. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly\navailable to employees of the registrant,\n3\nto fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Code and regulations\nthereunder.\n5. Indemnification Prohibition. The Company is prohibited from (a) indemnifying any Executive Officer against the loss of\nany Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and (b) paying, or reimbursing any Executive Officer for, the cost of any insurance\nto cover any such loss.\n6. Reporting and Disclosure. The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the\nrequirements of the federal securities laws, including disclosures required by applicable SEC filings.\n7. Amendment; Termination. The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion and shall\namend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations, including SEC rules or the\nrules of any national securities exchange or a national securities association on which the Company’s securities are listed.\nThe Board may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no amendment or termination of\nthis Policy shall adversely affect in any material way any Incentive-Based Compensation approved, granted, awarded,\nearned, or paid to an Executive Officer prior to the effective date of such amendment or termination, except solely to the\nextent such amendment or termination is required by applicable laws, rules, or regulations, including SEC rules or the rules\nof any national securities exchange or a national securities association on which the Company’s securities are listed.\n8. Other Recoupment Rights. The Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The\nCommittee may, as a condition to the grant of any benefit and employment with the Company or its subsidiaries, require an\nExecutive Officer to acknowledge and agree that any employment agreement, award agreement or other agreement entered\ninto or provided to such Executive Officer shall be subject to the terms of this Policy; provided, however, that the\nCommittee’s failure to do so shall not serve as a waiver of the Company’s rights or such Executive Officer’s obligations\nunder this Policy with respect to any such employment agreement, award agreement or other agreement. Any right of\nrecoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be\navailable to the Company, including any remedies or rights of recoupment pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation, policy\nor contract (including any compensation plan, employment agreement, award agreement, or similar agreement) or pursuant\nto any other legal remedies available to the Company. Nothing contained in this Policy, and no recoupment or recovery as\ncontemplated by this Policy, shall limit any claims, damages, or other legal remedies the Company or any of its affiliates may\nhave against an Executive Officer arising out of, or resulting from, any actions or omissions by the Executive Officer. This\nPolicy does not amend the Company’s Compensation and Recoupment and Restitution Policy, as may be amended from time\nto time (the “Employee Policy”), and the Employee Policy may be applied by the Company to each Executive Officer after\nthe application of this Policy to such Executive Officer.\n9. Acknowledgement. Each Executive Officer shall sign and return to the Company, within 45 calendar days following the\nlater of (i) the Effective Date, and (ii) the date the individual becomes an Executive Officer, the acknowledgement attached\nhereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which the Executive Officer agrees to be bound by, and to comply with, the terms and\nconditions of this Policy.\n4\n10. Successors. This Policy is binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors,\nadministrators, or other legal representatives.\n11. Governing Law; Venue. This Policy and all rights and obligations hereunder are governed by and construed in accordance\nwith the internal laws of the State of Ohio, excluding any choice of law rules or principles that may direct the application of\nthe laws of another jurisdiction. All actions arising out of or relating to this Policy shall be heard and determined exclusively\nin the courts of the State of Ohio, County of Franklin, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of Ohio.\n* * * * * * * * * *\nExhibit A\nDiamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.\nExecutive Officer Compensation Recoupment and Restitution Policy\nAcknowledgement\nPursuant to the Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.
