(Nasdaq: EXAS), a leading provider of cancer screening and diagnostic tests, will present 10 abstracts demonstrating the breadth of its Precision Oncology portfolio at the 2024 annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium ® (SABCS ® ) from December 10-13 in San Antonio, Texas. \n\n“Exact Sciences is committed to improving breast cancer care by providing actionable insights that support informed treatment decisions and help achieve the best outcomes for patients across all backgrounds,” said Dr. Rick Baehner, Chief Medical Officer, Precision Oncology at Exact Sciences. “For 20 years, the Oncotype DX test has led the way in personalized treatment planning, and the new findings presented at SABCS reinforce its trusted role among clinicians, research institutions, and patients alike. With the addition of our OncoExTra ®  test and our anticipated molecular residual disease monitoring test, we’re equipping clinicians with innovative solutions to support patient needs throughout every stage of cancer care.” \n\nIn collaboration with leading breast cancer experts and research groups, Exact Sciences will share data highlighting how the Oncotype DX test helps guide effective chemotherapy use in everyday practice and clinical trials. New findings from Japan will show how the test supports decision making in breast cancer treatment and can help manage costs. Additionally, retrospective findings reveal African American women are more likely to have higher Recurrence Score ® results than non-Hispanic White women, with similar survival outcomes. These insights emphasize how the Oncotype DX test can support more equitable breast cancer care across diverse populations and the need for further research to better understand factors behind racial disparities that currently exist. \n\nData presentations across Exact Sciences’ Precision Oncology portfolio include: \n\n**Title** : **(Neo)adjuvant nab-PAC weekly vs sb-PAC q2w, followed by EC q2w, in genomically or clinically high-risk HR+/HER- early breast cancer according to ET-response: Final survival results from the WSG ADAPT-HR+/HER2- chemotherapy-trial** **Session:** Late breaking oral presentation GS3-04.

In breast cancer, the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test is the only test shown to predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit as well as recurrence in invasive breast cancer. The Oncotype DX test is recognized as the standard of care and is included in all major breast cancer treatment guidelines. The OncoExTra test applies comprehensive tumor profiling, utilizing whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing, to aid in therapy selection for patients with advanced, metastatic, refractory, relapsed, or recurrent cancer. With an extensive panel of approximately 20,000 genes and 169 introns, the OncoExTra test is one of the most comprehensive genomic (DNA) and transcriptomic (RNA) panels available today. The Riskguard ® hereditary cancer test provides an individualized patient report that includes gene-specific and familial risks using a simple blood or saliva sample for 10 common cancers: colorectal, breast, prostate, skin, ovarian, endometrial, pancreatic, gastric, kidney, and endocrine. Exact Sciences enables patients to take a more active role in their cancer care and makes it easy for providers to order tests, interpret results, and personalize medicine.

These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we have made as of the date hereof and are subject to known and\nunknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, conditions and events to differ materially from those anticipated. Therefore, you\nshould not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we\nmake regarding expected future operating results; expectations for development of new or improved products and services; our strategies,\npositioning, resources, capabilities and expectations for future events or performance; and the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, including\nestimated synergies and other financial impacts.\nIn addition to the Company's financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP measures that it\ndetermines to be useful in evaluating its operating performance and liquidity. Management believes that presentation of operating results using\nnon-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company’s core operating\nresults and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets,\nmanage the Company’s business, and set incentive and compensation arrangements. The Company presents core revenue, non-GAAP gross\nmargin, non-GAAP gross profit, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible\nassets), adjusted research and development expenses, adjusted sales and marketing expenses, adjusted general and administrative expenses,\nadjusted amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjusted impairment of long-lived assets, adjusted other operating income (loss), adjusted\noperating income (loss), and free cash flow. This presentation includes certain of these measures. Please refer to our third-quarter 2024 earnings\nrelease for discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to GAAP financial measures. Information reconciling forward-looking non-\nGAAP measures to U.S. GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort due to the inherent uncertainty of the financial impact of items\nsuch as stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration costs including gains and losses on contingent consideration, and other significant\ncharges or gains that are difficult to predict for future periods because the nature of the adjustments pertain to events that have not yet occurred.\nAdditionally, management does not forecast many of the excluded items for internal use.\nEXACT SCIENCES 2\nExact Sciences is a leader\nin advanced cancer diagnostics\nOUR TEAM OUR FLAGSHIP TESTS Q3 RESULTS\n500 1.2 Record total revenue of $709M,\nM\n13% core revenue growth\nR&D team members test results in 3Q24\n1,400\nAdj.

While we have made progress, our execution during the third quarter and updated outlook for the full year don’t reflect our full potential. We plan to accelerate growth in 2025, and our long-term outlook remains strong.” \n\n**Third-quarter 2024 financial results**\n\n_For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023 (where applicable):_\n\n  * Total revenue was $709 million, an increase of 13 percent on a reported and core revenue basis \n  * Screening revenue was $545 million, an increase of 15 percent \n  * Precision Oncology revenue was $164 million, an increase of 5 percent on a reported and core revenue basis \n  * Gross margin including amortization of acquired intangible assets was 69 percent, and non-GAAP gross margin excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets was 72 percent \n  * Other operating income was $3 million compared to $72 million, which included a gain related to the sale of the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score Test in third-quarter 2023 \n  * Net loss was $38 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share, a reduction of $39 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share \n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $99 million an increase of $42 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 14 percent, an increase of 500 basis points \n  * Operating cash flow was $139 million and free cash flow was $113 million, increases of $114 million and $113 million, respectively \n  * Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $1.02 billion at the end of the quarter \n\n\n\nScreening primarily includes laboratory service revenue from Cologuard tests and PreventionGenetics. Precision Oncology includes laboratory service revenue from global Oncotype DX and therapy selection tests. \n\n**Platform and pipeline advancements**\n\nThe Company's ExactNexus™ technology platform allows Exact Sciences to connect electronically with patients, health systems, healthcare professionals, and payers. The digital tools and data embedded within the ExactNexus platform enable personalized customer experiences, creating a streamlined process for accessing information, enhancing patient engagement, and improving health outcomes. This approach contributed to strong growth in Cologuard test utilization among rescreen patients and within care gap programs during the third quarter. \n\nExact Sciences received FDA approval for the Cologuard Plus test, its next-generation Cologuard test. The Cologuard Plus test detects cancers and precancerous polyps with even greater sensitivity than the Cologuard test while reducing false positives by more than 30 percent. This advancement enhances the Company’s screening capabilities and reinforces its commitment to delivering high-quality, non-invasive options for patients. With the Cologuard Plus test, the Company expects to secure a higher price through an established Medicare pathway. \n\nIn the third quarter, the Company also presented data for its blood-based colorectal cancer screening test, showcasing a sensitivity of 88% for colorectal cancer and 31% for advanced precancerous lesions at 90% specificity. These results show the potential of the Company's novel marker panel to detect advanced precancerous lesions and cancers at an attractive cost profile. This innovation is expected to provide average-risk patients with another screening option, reinforcing the power of the Company’s unique scientific approach. \n\nExact Sciences secured acceptance from a peer-reviewed journal for its first publication on the Oncodetect test, its molecular residual disease and recurrence monitoring test. These data are currently under embargo and are expected to be shared in January 2025. With nearly 6 million cancer survivors in the U.S. who could benefit from residual and recurrent disease testing, the need is urgent - yet less than 5% are currently receiving the vital testing today. This recognition highlights the scientific rigor behind the product and positions the Oncodetect test as a leading solution for monitoring residual disease and cancer recurrence. \n\nThe Company also shared evidence supporting its blood-based multi-cancer screening test, assessing organ-specific performance of methylation and protein biomarkers in a prospectively collected cohort of samples from its ASCEND 2 study. The analysis indicated an overall sensitivity of 55% in cancers without standard-of-care screening options (excluding lung), and 64% in the six most aggressive cancers with the shortest survival rates, with a specificity of 98.5%. These findings highlight the potential clinical value of using multiple biomarkers to detect various cancer types, including the most aggressive and those without recommended screening options. \n\n**2024 outlook**\n\nThe Company has updated its full-year 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance: \n\n**Prior guidance** |  **November 5 update**  \n---|---  \nTotal revenue  |  $2.810 - $2.850 billion  |  $2.730 - $2.750 billion   \nScreening  |  $2.155 - $2.175 billion  |  $2.080 - $2.095 billion   \nPrecision Oncology  |  $655 - $675 million  |  $650 - $655 million   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $335 - $355 million  |  $310 - $320 million   \n  \n**Third-quarter 2024 conference call & webcast**\n\nCompany management will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 5 p.m. ET to discuss third-quarter 2024 results. The webcast will be available at exactsciences.com. Domestic callers should dial 888-330-2384 and international callers should dial +1-240-789-2701. The access code for both domestic and international callers is 4437608. A replay of the webcast will be available at exactsciences.com. The webcast, conference call, and replay are open to all interested parties. \n\n**Non-GAAP disclosure**\n\nIn addition to the Company’s financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP measures that it determines to be useful in evaluating its operating performance and liquidity. The Company presents core revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP gross profit, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets), adjusted research and development expenses, adjusted sales and marketing expenses, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjusted impairment of long-lived assets, adjusted other operating income (loss), adjusted operating income (loss), and free cash flow. Core revenue is calculated to adjust for recent acquisitions and divestitures, COVID-19 testing revenue and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. To exclude the impact of change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior period under comparison, the Company converts the current period non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue using the prior year comparative period exchange rates. The Company defines non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets used in the calculation of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin pertain only to the amortization associated with developed technology acquired and recorded through purchase accounting transactions. The amortization of these intangible assets will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets), adjusted research and development expenses, adjusted sales and marketing expenses, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjusted impairment of long-lived assets, adjusted other operating income (loss), and adjusted operating income (loss) consist of the applicable GAAP measure after adjustment for those items shown in the reconciliations below. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. The Company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure and is calculated as net cash used in or provided by operating activities, reduced by purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company’s core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial information to establish budgets, manage the Company’s business, and set incentive and compensation arrangements. The Company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors since it measures our ability to generate cash from business operations. Non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental information purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets although such measures include the revenue associated with the acquisitions. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA and other adjusted operating result metrics exclude a number of expense items that are included in net loss. As a result, positive adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating income may be achieved while a significant net loss persists. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP, see below “Reconciliation of Core Revenue”, “Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin Reconciliations”, “Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliations”, “Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures”, and “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow”. The Company presents certain forward-looking statements about the Company’s future financial performance that include non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures include adjustments like stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration costs including gains and losses on contingent consideration, and other significant charges or gains that are difficult to predict for future periods because the nature of the adjustments pertain to events that have not yet occurred. Additionally management does not forecast many of the excluded items for internal use. Information reconciling forward-looking non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP measures is therefore not available without unreasonable effort, and is not provided. The occurrence, timing, and amount of any of the items excluded from GAAP to calculate non-GAAP could significantly impact the Company’s GAAP results. \n\n**About the Cologuard® and Cologuard Plus™ tests:**\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, the Cologuard and Cologuard Plus tests are non-invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) screening options for the 110 million U.S. adults ages 45 or older who are at average risk for the disease. \n\nThe Cologuard test revolutionized CRC screening by detecting specific DNA markers and blood associated with cancer and precancer in stool, allowing patients to use the test at home without special preparation or time off. It is covered by Medicare and included in national screening guidelines from both the American Cancer Society (2018) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2021). Since its launch in 2014, the Cologuard test has been used to screen for CRC 17 million times. \n\nBuilding on this success, the FDA-approved Cologuard Plus test raises the performance bar even further and features novel biomarkers, improved laboratory processes, and enhanced sample stability. The Cologuard Plus test is expected to reduce false positives by more than 30%, to help minimize unnecessary follow-up colonoscopies. Both tests demonstrate Exact Sciences’ commitment to improving CRC screening access and outcomes. Exact Sciences expects to launch the Cologuard Plus test with Medicare coverage and guideline inclusion in 2025. \n\n**About Exact Sciences’ Precision Oncology portfolio**\n\nExact Sciences’ Precision Oncology portfolio delivers actionable genomic insights to inform prognosis and cancer treatment after a diagnosis.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, this represents the remeasurement of the associated contingent consideration. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, this represents a gain of $3.1 million from additional cash and equity consideration received, a $68.9 million contingent consideration gain, and $1.5 million in legal and professional service fees. \n\n(6) Includes costs associated with the Company's business transformation program intended to consolidate operations, achieve targeted cost reductions, and focus resources on its key strategic priorities.

A leading provider of cancer\nscreening and diagnostic tests, Exact Sciences gives patients and health care professionals the clarity needed to take life-changing action earlier. Building on the\nsuccess of the Cologuard® and Oncotype DX® tests, Exact Sciences is investing in its pipeline to develop innovative solutions for use before, during, and after a\ncancer diagnosis.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company and those of its wholly owned subsidiaries and\nvariable interest entities, are unaudited and have been prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes as of\nand for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “2023 Form 10-K”). All intercompany transactions and\nbalances have been eliminated upon consolidation. These condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted (“GAAP”) in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and follow the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for\ninterim reporting. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only\nof adjustments of a normal and recurring nature) considered necessary for a fair statement of its financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods\npresented. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited financial statements, but does not contain all of the\nfootnote disclosures from the 2023 Form 10-K. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of the\nCompany’s operations for any other interim period or for a full fiscal year. The statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and\nrelated notes included in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that affect the Company’s financial statements materially and involve\ndifficult, subjective or complex judgments by management, and actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates include revenue recognition,\nvaluation of intangible assets and goodwill, contingent consideration, and accounting for income taxes. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates\nare explained further in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the 2023 Form 10-K.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in the Company’s\n2023 Form 10-K, except as described in the Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements sections below.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2024-02: Codification Improvement –\nAmendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements. This update amends the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) to remove references to\nvarious FASB Concepts Statements. The Company early adopted and prospectively applied the amendments in this update during the first quarter of fiscal year\n2024. There was no significant impact to the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\n10\nTable of Contents\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and\nSimplification Initiative. This update modifies the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of topics in the ASC to conform with certain SEC\namendments in Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively, and the effective date\nfor each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or S-K becomes effective. However, if the SEC\nhas not removed the related disclosure from its regulations by June 30, 2027, the amendments will be removed from the Codification and not become effective.\nEarly adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This update\nimproves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures of significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update\nshould be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December\n31, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential\nimpact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures. This update improves income tax\ndisclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced transparency and decision usefulness of disclosures. The amendments in this update should be applied\nprospectively with the option to apply retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per common share (“EPS”) was determined by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is based on shares that are outstanding per the calculation of basic EPS and on potentially dilutive\nshares.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to calculate basic EPS and diluted EPS for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) available to common shareholders $ (38,236) $ 794 $ (164,272) $ (154,383)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic 184,795 180,649 183,823 179,817\nEffect of dilutive shares:\nRestricted stock awards — 2,153 — —\nStock options — 646 — —\nEmployee stock purchase plan — 589 — —\nPerformance share units — 38 — —\nDilutive potential common shares — 3,426 — —\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 184,795 184,075 183,823 179,817\nEarnings per common share from net earnings - basic $ (0.21) $ 0.00 $ (0.89) $ (0.86)\nEarnings per common share from net earnings - diluted $ (0.21) $ 0.00 $ (0.89) $ (0.86)\n11\nTable of Contents\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nThe following potentially issuable common shares were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because they would have an anti-dilutive\neffect due to net losses for each period:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nShares issuable upon conversion of convertible notes 26,526 23,231 26,526 23,231\nShares issuable upon the release of restricted stock awards 7,487 — 7,487 6,423\nShares issuable upon the release of performance share units 2,037 — 2,037 1,584\nShares issuable upon exercise of stock options 1,028 — 1,028 1,305\n37,078 23,231 37,078 32,543\n(2) REVENUE\nThe Company’s revenue is primarily generated by its laboratory testing services utilizing its Cologuard and Oncotype® tests.

The Company estimates the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the regulatory and product\ndevelopment milestones using the probability-weighted scenario based discounted cash flow model, which is consistent with the initial measurement of the\ncontingent consideration liabilities. Probabilities of success are applied to each potential scenario and the resulting values are discounted using a present-value\nfactor. The passage of time in addition to changes in projected milestone achievement timing, present-value factor, the degree of achievement, if applicable, and\nprobabilities of success may result in adjustments to the fair value measurement. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability recorded related to\nregulatory and product development milestones was determined using a weighted average probability of success of 90% and 89% as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, and a weighted average present-value factor of 6.0% and 5.8% as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe projected fiscal year of payment range is from 2025 to 2031.

The aggregate carrying amount of these funds, which are classified as a component of other long-term assets, net in the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets, was $6.7 million and $5.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts on the last day of each month to mitigate the impact of adverse movements in foreign exchange\nrates related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities and hedge the Company’s foreign currency exchange rate exposure. As of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023 the Company had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $47.7 million and $39.5 million, respectively. The\nCompany's foreign exchange derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using inputs that are observable in\nthe market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair value of the open foreign currency forward contracts was zero at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and there were no gains or losses recorded to adjust the fair value of the open foreign currency contract held as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The contracts are closed subsequent to each month-end, and the gains and losses recorded from the contracts were not significant for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n20\nTable of Contents\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(8) LONG-TERM DEBT\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facility\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company, through a wholly-owned special purpose entity, Exact Receivables LLC (“Exact Receivables”) entered into an accounts\nreceivable securitization program (the “Securitization Facility”) with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”), with a scheduled maturity date of June 29, 2024.\nThe Securitization Facility required the Company to maintain minimum borrowings under the facility of $50.0 million. Upon the maturity of the Securitization\nFacility in June 2024, the Company repaid the previously outstanding balance of $50.0 million in full. The Securitization Facility provided Exact Receivables with\na revolving line-of-credit of up to $150.0 million of borrowing capacity, subject to certain borrowing base requirements, by collateralizing a security interest in the\ndomestic customer accounts receivable of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. The amount available under the Securitization Facility fluctuated\nover time based on the total amount of eligible customer accounts receivable generated by the Company during the normal course of operations. The debt issuance\ncosts incurred related to the Securitization Facility were not significant and were amortized over the life of the Securitization Facility through interest expense\nwithin the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nIn connection with the Securitization Facility, the Company also entered into two Receivables Purchase Agreements (“Receivable Purchase Agreements”) on\nJune 29, 2022. The Receivable Purchase Agreements were among the Company and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and between the Company\nand Exact Receivables. Under the agreements, the wholly-owned subsidiaries sold all of their right, title and interest in their accounts receivables to Exact\nReceivables. The receivables were used to collateralize borrowings made under the Securitization Facility. The Company retained the responsibility of servicing the\naccounts receivable balances pledged as collateral under the Securitization Facility and provided a performance guaranty.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had an outstanding balance of $50.0 million, which was included in debt, current portion on the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet. Prior to the repayment, the outstanding balance accrued interest at a rate equal to a daily secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”)\nplus a SOFR adjustment and an applicable margin. The interest rate was 6.89% as of the maturity date.\nRevolving Loan Agreement\nDuring November 2021, the Company entered into a revolving loan agreement (the “Revolving Loan Agreement”) with PNC. The Revolving Loan Agreement\nprovides the Company with a revolving line of credit of up to $150.0 million (the “Revolver”). The Revolver is collateralized by the Company’s marketable\nsecurities held by PNC, which must continue to maintain a minimum market value of $150.0 million.

The 2025 Notes were included in convertible notes, net, less current portion as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIssuances and Settlements\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a privately negotiated exchange and purchase agreement with a single holder of certain of the Company’s\nconvertible notes due in 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) and 2028 (the “2028 Notes”). The Company issued the holder $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.0%\nConvertible Notes due in 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) in exchange for $183.7 million of aggregate principal of 2027 Notes, $201.0 million of aggregate principal of\n2028 Notes, and $138.0 million of cash. The extinguishment resulted in a gain on settlement of convertible notes of $17.7 million, which is included in interest\nexpense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain represents the difference between (i) the\nfair value of the consideration transferred and (ii) the carrying value of the debt at the time of exchange.\nIn March 2023, the Company entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement with two holders of certain of the 2025 Notes. The Company issued the\nholder $73.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2030 Notes in exchange for $65.8 million of aggregate principal of 2025 Notes. The extinguishment resulted in\na loss on settlement of convertible notes of $7.4 million, which is included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The loss represents the difference between (i) the fair value of the consideration transferred and (ii) the carrying value of the\ndebt at the time of exchange.\n22\nTable of Contents\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes were approximately $133.0 million, after deducting commissions and offering expenses payable by the\nCompany.\nThe 2030 Notes will mature on March 1, 2030 and bear interest at a rate of 2.0% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of\neach year, beginning on September 1, 2023.\nIn April 2024, the Company entered into a privately negotiated exchange and purchase agreement with certain holders of the Company’s 2028 Notes. The\nCompany issued $620.7 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Notes due in 2031 (the “2031 Notes” and, collectively with the 2025 Notes, 2027\nNotes, 2028 Notes, and 2030 Notes, the “Notes”) in exchange for $359.7 million of aggregate principal of 2028 Notes, and $266.8 million of cash after deducting\nunderwriting discounts. The extinguishment resulted in a gain on settlement of convertible notes of $10.3 million, which is included in interest expense in the\ncondensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The gain represents the difference between (i) the fair value of the\nconsideration transferred and (ii) the carrying value of the debt at the time of exchange.\nThe net proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Notes were approximately $259.8 million, after deducting commissions and offering expenses payable by the\nCompany.\nThe 2031 Notes will mature on April 15, 2031 and bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of\neach year, beginning on October 15, 2024. The Company has the ability to repurchase the 2031 Notes after April 17, 2029 upon the occurrence of certain events and\nduring certain periods, as set forth in the Indenture filed at the time of the offering.\nSummary of Conversion Features\nUntil the six-months immediately preceding the maturity date of the applicable series of the Company’s convertible notes, each series of Notes is convertible\nonly upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, as set forth in the Indentures filed at the time of the original offerings. On or after the date\nthat is six-months immediately preceding the maturity date of the applicable series of Notes until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day\nimmediately preceding the maturity date, holders may elect to convert such Notes at any time, and if elected, the conversion would occur on the maturity date. The\nNotes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock (plus, if applicable, cash in lieu of any fractional share), or a combination of cash and\nshares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. If the Notes are not converted prior to the maturity date, the principal amount will be settled in\ncash upon maturity.\nIt is the Company’s intent to settle all conversions through combination settlement. The initial conversion rate is 13.26, 8.96, 8.21, 12.37, and 10.06 shares of\ncommon stock per $1,000 principal amount for the 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2030 Notes, and 2031 Notes, respectively, which is equivalent to an initial\nconversion price of approximately $75.43, $111.66, $121.84, $80.83, and $99.36 per share of the Company’s common stock for the 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028\nNotes, 2030 Notes, and 2031 Notes, respectively. The 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2030 Notes, and 2031 Notes are potentially convertible into up to\n3.3 million, 5.0 million, 4.8 million, 7.1 million, and 6.2 million shares, respectively. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain\nspecified events as set forth in the Indentures filed at the time of the original offerings but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, holders\nof the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the Indentures), will, under certain circumstances, be\nentitled to an increase in the conversion rate.\nIf the Company undergoes a “fundamental change” (as defined in the Indentures), holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or\npart of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nBased on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $68.12 on September 30, 2024, the if-converted values on the Notes do not exceed the principal\namount.\nThe Notes do not contain any financial or operating covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the issuance of other indebtedness, or the\nissuance or repurchase of securities by the Company.\n23\nTable of Contents\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nRanking of Convertible Notes\nThe Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and (i) rank senior in right of payment to all of its future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated\nin right of payment to the Notes; (ii) rank equal in right of payment to each outstanding series thereof and to all of the Company’s future liabilities that are not so\nsubordinated, unsecured indebtedness; (iii) are effectively junior to all of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness and other secured obligations, to\nthe extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness and other secured obligations; and (iv) are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other\nliabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nIssuance Costs\nIssuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes.

The scope of the license covers any screening, surveillance or diagnostic test or tool for use in connection with any\ntype of cancer, pre-cancer, disease or condition. The Company’s license agreement with Mayo was most recently amended and restated in September 2020.\nThe licensed Mayo patents and patent applications contain both method and composition claims that relate to sample processing, analytical testing and data\nanalysis associated with nucleic acid screening for cancers and other diseases. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S.,\nAustralia, Canada, the European Union, China, Japan and Korea. Under the license agreement, the Company assumed the obligation and expense of prosecuting\nand maintaining the licensed Mayo patents and is obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to bring to market products using the licensed Mayo\nintellectual property.\nPursuant to the Company’s agreement with Mayo, the Company is required to pay Mayo a low-single-digit royalty on the Company’s net sales of current and\nfuture products using the licensed Mayo intellectual property each year during the term of the Mayo agreement.\nThe Company is also required to pay Mayo up to $3.0 million in sales-based milestone payments upon cumulative net sales of each product using the licensed\nMayo intellectual property reaching specified levels.\nThe license agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the agreement, until the last of the licensed patents\nexpires in 2039 (or later, if certain licensed patent applications are issued). However, if the Company is still using the licensed Mayo know-how or certain Mayo-\nprovided biological specimens or their derivatives on such expiration date, the term shall continue until the earlier of the date the Company stops using such know-\nhow and materials and the date that is five years after the last licensed patent expires. The license agreement contains customary termination provisions and permits\nMayo to terminate the license agreement if the Company sues Mayo or its affiliates, other than any such suit claiming an uncured material breach by Mayo of the\nlicense agreement.\nIn addition to granting the Company a license to the covered Mayo intellectual property, Mayo provides the Company with product development and research\nand development assistance pursuant to the license agreement and other collaborative arrangements. In September 2020, Mayo also agreed to make available\ncertain personnel to provide such assistance through January 2025. In connection with this collaboration, the Company has incurred insignificant charges for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Under\nthe agreement, the Company was obligated to make milestone payments to TGen of up to $45.0 million in sales-based milestone payments upon cumulative net\nsales related to molecular residual disease (“MRD”) detection and/or treatment reaching specified levels. These payments were contingent upon achievement of\nthese cumulative revenues on or before December 31, 2030, which was not achieved prior to the termination.\nEffective May 1, 2024, the Company entered into termination agreements (the “Termination Agreements”) with TGen for the purpose of terminating the license\nand sponsored research agreement relating to the TARDIS technology and an additional sponsored research agreement with a broader scope (collectively, the\n“Original Agreements”). As part of the Termination Agreements, the Company will pay TGen $27.6 million in compensation for the termination of the Original\nAgreements, which will be allocated into three annual installments of $9.2 million per year beginning in the second quarter of 2024. The fair value of the\ntermination payments as of the date of the Termination Agreements was $25.8 million, which was recorded as research and development expense in the condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations in the second quarter of 2024. The remaining $1.8 million in expense is being recognized ratably through the date of the final\npayment in the second quarter of 2026.

The Company used the income approach, under which the recoverability of the assets was measured by comparing the carrying amount of the\nasset to future undiscounted, pre-tax cash flows generated by the assets held. The fair value of the assets was determined using discounted cash flows, and the\nimpairment charge recorded represents the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the impaired assets. The impairment charge recorded is included\nin impairment of long-lived assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n30\nTable of Contents\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s right-of-use assets from finance leases are $21.6 million and $11.3 million, respectively,\nwhich are reported in other long-term assets, net in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has outstanding\nfinance lease obligations of $22.7 million, of which $7.9 million is reported in other current liabilities and $14.8 million is reported in other long-term liabilities in\nthe Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has also instituted, and may in the future\ninstitute, additional legal proceedings to enforce its rights and seek remedies, such as monetary damages, injunctive relief and declaratory relief.\nThe Company accrues costs for certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters to the extent that it determines an unfavorable outcome is probable and the\namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. While such accrued costs reflect the Company’s best estimate of the probable loss for such matters, the recorded\namounts may differ materially from the actual amount of any such losses. In some cases, no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts\naccrued, if any, can be made because of the inherently unpredictable nature of legal and regulatory proceedings, which may be exacerbated by various factors,\nincluding but not limited to, that they may involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel\nlegal theories or legal uncertainties; involve disputed facts; represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of parties, claimants or regulatory bodies;\nare in the early stages of the proceedings; involve a number of separate proceedings and/or a wide range of potential outcomes; or result in a change of business\npractices.\nAs of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, amounts accrued for legal proceedings and regulatory matters were not material. The Company believes\nthat the ultimate outcome of any of the regulatory and legal proceedings that are currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flow or liquidity. However, it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period the Company’s financial condition, results\nof operations, cash flow and/or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of, or development in, legal and/or regulatory\nproceedings.\nRefer to the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K for detailed disclosures on legal matters that were settled in 2023.\nIntellectual Property Litigation Matters\nIn May 2023, after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from the Company regarding its patent infringement, Geneoscopy Inc. (“Geneoscopy”) requested a\nreexamination of the Company’s U.S. Patent No. 11,634,781 (the “’781 Patent”) by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”). Upon\ncompletion of the reexamination in October 2023, the USPTO rejected Geneoscopy’s challenge. In November 2023, the Company filed suit against Geneoscopy in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that certain of Geneoscopy’s products infringe the ‘781 Patent and seeking unspecified\nmonetary damages and injunctive relief (the “’781 Action”) and in May 2024, the Company filed a second complaint against Geneoscopy alleging infringement of\nthe Company’s U.S. Patent No. 11,970,746 (the “’746 Patent”), which has been consolidated with the ’781 Action. On June 28, 2024, Geneoscopy filed\ncounterclaims against the Company challenging the validity of the patents at issue and alleging breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair\ncompetition, and other violations of state and federal law seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief, which were amended on August 16, 2024.\nOn July 16, 2024, the Company filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order prohibiting Geneoscopy from selling its infringing Colosense test in the\nUnited States. On August 8, 2024, Geneoscopy filed a motion to stay pending inter partes review of the ‘781 Patent, which is fully briefed. On August 30, 2024, the\nCompany filed a motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim, which is fully briefed. On September 3, 2024, the Court entered a stipulated order for briefing and\nexpedited discovery for the Company’s preliminary injunction motion. On September 27, 2024, Geneoscopy filed its opposition to the Company’s motion for\npreliminary injunction, and the parties are currently engaged in expedited discovery. Briefing for the Company’s motion for preliminary injunction will be complete\nby the end of November 2024.\n31\nTable of Contents\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nIn January 2024, Geneoscopy petitioned the USPTO to institute an inter partes review (“IPR”) challenging the validity of the ‘781 Patent before the Patent\nTrial and Appeals Board (“PTAB”). On July 26, 2024, the PTAB notified the Company that it decided to institute review. The Company filed its Patent Owner\nResponse on October 25, 2024, and the parties are currently engaged in discovery. The Company intends to defend the validity of the ‘781 Patent, and a final\ndecision of that review will be made on or before July 30, 2025.\nOn August 20, 2024, Geneoscopy filed a petition for inter partes review of the ‘746 Patent before the PTAB. The Company’s Patent Owner Preliminary\nResponse is due November 27, 2024. The PTAB is expected to decide on or before February 27, 2025, whether it will institute the IPR. If the IPR is instituted, the\nCompany intends to defend the validity of the ‘746 Patent, and a final decision of that review will be made on or before February 27, 2026.\n(14) WISCONSIN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS\nDuring December 2021, the Company entered into an amended agreement (“Amended WEDC Agreement”) with the Wisconsin Economic Development\nCorporation (“WEDC”) to earn an additional $18.5 million in refundable tax credits on the condition that the Company expends $350.0 million in capital\ninvestments and establishes and maintains 1,300 additional full-time positions over a five-year period. The capital investment credits are earned at a rate of 10% of\neligible capital investments up to a maximum of $7.0 million, while the jobs creation credits are earned annually pursuant to the Amended WEDC Agreement.\nThe tax credits earned are first applied against the tax liability otherwise due, and if there is no such liability present, the claim for tax credits will be\nreimbursed in cash to the Company. The maximum amount of the refundable tax credit to be earned for each year is fixed, and the Company earns the credits by\nmeeting certain capital investment and job creation thresholds over the term of the Amended WEDC Agreement. Should the Company earn and receive the job\ncreation tax credits but not maintain those full-time positions through the end of the agreement, the Company may be required to pay those credits back to the\nWEDC.\nThe Company records the earned tax credits as job creation and capital investments occurs. The tax credits earned from capital investment are recognized as a\nreduction to capital expenditures at the time the costs are incurred, and then as an offset to depreciation expense over the expected life of the acquired capital assets.\nThe tax credits earned related to job creation are recognized as an offset to operational expenses in the period in which the credits are earned.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has earned $14.3 million of the refundable tax credits under the Amended WEDC Agreement. The unpaid portion is\n$8.8 million, of which $4.2 million is reported in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $4.6 million is reported in other long-term assets, net in the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated balance sheets reflecting when collection of the refundable tax credits is expected to occur. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amounts recorded as an offset to capital expenditures and operating expenses for the tax credits earned were not\nsignificant.\n(15) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nBusiness Combinations\nResolution Bioscience, Inc.\nOn September 12, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Resolution Bioscience, Inc. (“Resolution\nBioscience”) from Agilent Technologies, Inc. The acquisition provides the Company with a high-quality blood-based therapy selection platform, complementing its\ncomprehensive, tissue-based OncoExTra® test.\nRefer to the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K for detailed disclosures on the combination, including the fair value of the consideration transferred, purchase price\nallocation, and goodwill and intangible assets identified in the transaction. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant\nchanges to the purchase price and purchase price allocation, and the measurement period has closed.\n32\nTable of Contents\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nDivestitures\nOncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score Test\nOn August 2, 2022, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with MDxHealth SA (“MDxHealth”), the Company completed\nthe sale of the intellectual property and know-how related to the Company’s Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score test (“GPS test”). On August 23, 2023, the\nCompany and MDxHealth executed the Second Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Second Amendment”). Under the Second Amendment, the\nCompany agreed to allow MDxHealth to defer the 2023 contingent consideration payment by three years in exchange for additional consideration and more\nfavorable contingent consideration terms, including elimination of the minimum revenue thresholds previously required to be met under the Asset Purchase\nAgreement. Refer to the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional details on the agreements.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a portion of the contingent consideration is classified as a contract asset. As of September 30, 2024, the\ncontract asset was $48.3 million, of which $25.8 million is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $22.5 million is included in other long-term\nassets, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the contract asset was $41.7 million, which is included in other long-term assets\non the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The contract asset was estimated using historical GPS test revenues by MDxHealth under the most likely amount\nmethod. The remaining consideration balance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $31.6 million, which includes the amount earned during the\n2023 earnout year and is classified as a receivable within other long-term assets, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company recorded an\ninsignificant contingent consideration gain for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is included in other operating income in the condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations.\n(16) SEGMENT INFORMATION\nManagement determined that the Company functions as a single operating segment, and thus reports as a single reportable segment. This operating segment is\nfocused on the development and global commercialization of clinical laboratory services allowing healthcare providers and patients to make individualized\ntreatment decisions. Management assessed the financial information routinely reviewed by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker, its President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, to monitor the Company's operating performance and support decisions regarding allocation of resources to its operations. Performance is\ncontinuously monitored at the consolidated level to timely identify deviations from expected results.\nThe following table summarizes total revenue from customers by geographic region. Product revenues are attributed to countries based on ship-to location.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnited States $ 659,222 $ 589,739 $ 1,904,755 $ 1,741,428\nOutside of United States 49,433 38,599 140,688 111,453\nTotal revenues $ 708,655 $ 628,338 $ 2,045,443 $ 1,852,881\nLong-lived assets located in countries outside of the U.S. are not significant.\n(17) INCOME TAXES\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $0.8 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nCompany recorded income tax expense of $4.1 million and $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s\nincome tax expense recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to current foreign and state tax expense. A deferred\ntax liability of $19.3 million and $17.3 million was recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is included in other long-term\nliabilities on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets\nbased on management’s determination that it is more likely than not the benefit will not be realized.\n33\nTable of Contents\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company had $42.0 million and $36.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts\nhave been recorded as a reduction to the Company’s deferred tax asset, if recognized they would not have an impact on the effective tax rate due to the existing\nvaluation allowance. Certain of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits could change due to activities of various tax authorities, including possible settlement of\naudits, or through normal expiration of various statutes of limitations. The Company does not expect a material change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next\ntwelve months.\nAs of September 30, 2024, due to the carryforward of unutilized net operating losses and research and development credits, the Company is subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax examinations for the tax years 2000 through 2024, and to state income tax examinations for the tax years 2000 through 2024. No interest or\npenalties related to income taxes have been accrued or recognized as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has endorsed a framework (“Pillar Two”) with model rules introducing a global minimum\ncorporate tax rate via a system where multinational groups with consolidated revenue over €750.0 million are subject to a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on\nincome arising in low-tax jurisdictions on a country-by-country basis. Many countries have implemented laws based on these model rules, with effective dates\nbeginning January 1, 2024. These rules do not have a material impact on the Company for the current period and, as currently designed, are not expected to\nmaterially increase the Company’s global tax costs. The Company will continue to monitor U.S. and global legislative action related to Pillar Two for potential\nimpacts.\n34\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nObjective\nThe purpose of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis is to better allow our investors to understand and view our Company from management’s\nperspective. We are providing an overview of our business and strategy including a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations. The following\ndiscussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related\nnotes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and notes thereto and Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form\n10-K”), which has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended to be covered by the “safe harbor” created by those sections. Forward-looking\nstatements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-\nlooking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate”\nor other comparable terms. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding our strategies,\nprospects, expectations, financial condition, operations, costs, plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements\ninclude, among others, statements we make regarding expected future operating results; expectations for development of new or improved products and services\nand their impact on patients; our strategies, positioning, resources, capabilities and expectations for future events or performance; and the anticipated benefits of\nour acquisitions, including estimated synergies and other financial impacts. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future\nperformance or events. Instead, they are based only on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and\nstrategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are\nsubject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Actual results,\nconditions and events may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking\nstatements. Important factors that could cause actual results, conditions and events to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements\ninclude, among others, the following: our ability to successfully and profitably market our products and services; the acceptance of our products and services by\npatients and healthcare providers; our ability to meet demand for our products and services; our reliance upon certain suppliers, including suppliers that are the\nsole source of certain supplies and products used in our tests and operations; approval and maintenance of adequate reimbursement rates for our products and\nservices within and outside of the U.S.; the amount and nature of competition for our products and services; the effects of any judicial, executive or legislative\naction affecting us or the healthcare system; recommendations, guidelines and quality metrics issued by various organizations regarding cancer screening or our\nproducts and services; our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products and services and assess potential market opportunities; our ability to\neffectively enter into and utilize strategic partnerships and acquisitions; our success establishing and maintaining collaborative, licensing and supplier\narrangements; our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with applicable regulations; our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual\nproperty; the results of our validation studies and clinical trials, including the risks that the results of future studies and trials may differ materially from the results\nof previously completed studies and trials; our ability to manage an international business and our expectations regarding our international expansion and\nopportunities; our ability to raise the capital necessary to support our operations or meet our payment obligations under our indebtedness; the potential effects of\nchanging macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of inflation, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and geopolitical conflict; the\npossibility that the anticipated benefits from our business acquisitions will not be realized in full or at all or may take longer to realize than expected; the possibility\nthat costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquired businesses’ operations or the divestiture of business operations will be greater than expected and the\npossibility that integration or divestiture efforts will disrupt our business and strain management time and resources; the outcome of any litigation, government\ninvestigations, enforcement actions or other legal proceedings; and our ability to retain and hire key personnel. The risks included above are not exhaustive. Other\nimportant risks and uncertainties are described in the Risk Factors and in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nsections of the 2023 Form 10-K and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any such\nforward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to\npublicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future\ndevelopments or otherwise.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nA leading provider of cancer screening and diagnostic tests, Exact Sciences Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Exact,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the\n“Company”) gives patients and health care professionals the clarity needed to take life-changing action earlier. Building on the success of the Cologuard® and\nOncotype DX® tests, we are investing in our pipeline to develop innovative solutions for use before, during, and after a cancer diagnosis.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we achieved many critical milestones, including:\n• delivering tests results to 1.2 million people including a record number for Cologuard and Oncotype DX,\n• growing total revenue 13% year-over-year while leveraging efficiencies in our operating expenses,\n• generating cash provided by operating activities of $138.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an improvement of $114.4 million\nin comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023,\n• increasing customer satisfaction and brand awareness to all-time highs,\n• receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval for Cologuard PlusTM, our next-generation Cologuard test,\n• showcasing data at the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) 2024 congress for our liquid biopsy colon cancer screening and multi-\ncancer screening tests, and\n• gaining acceptance from a top-tier journal for the first publication of OncodetectTM, our molecular residual disease (“MRD”) test.\nOur Screening Tests\nCologuard Test\nColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States (“U.S.”) and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. among non-\nsmokers. Each year in the U.S., there are approximately 153,000 new cases of colorectal cancer and approximately 53,000 deaths. It is widely accepted that\ncolorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers.\nOur flagship screening product, the Cologuard test, is a patient-friendly, non-invasive stool-based DNA (“sDNA”) screening test that utilizes a multi-target\napproach to detect DNA and hemoglobin biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Upon approval by the FDA in August 2014, our Cologuard\ntest became the first and only FDA-approved sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Our Cologuard test is now indicated for average risk adults 45\nyears of age and older. In October 2024, the FDA approved Cologuard Plus, our next-generation Cologuard test, which we expect to launch with Medicare coverage\nand guideline inclusion in 2025.\nGenetic Testing\nWe provide more than 5,000 predefined genetic tests for nearly all clinically relevant genes, additional custom panels, and comprehensive germline, whole\nexome (“PGxome®”), and whole genome (“PGnome®”) sequencing tests.\nRiskguardTM, our hereditary cancer test, helps people understand their inherited risk of cancer, arming them with critical information to make more informed\ntreatment decisions.\nOur Precision Oncology Tests\nOur precision oncology portfolio delivers actionable genomic insights to inform prognosis and cancer treatment after a diagnosis. In breast cancer, the\nOncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score® test is the only test shown to predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit as well as the chance of cancer recurrence in\nthe most common sub-type of early-stage breast cancer. As the only test proven to predict both the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit and cancer recurrence, the\nOncotype DX test is recognized globally as standard of care and is included in all major breast cancer treatment guidelines. The OncoExTra® test applies\ncomprehensive tumor profiling, utilizing whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing, to aid in therapy selection for patients with advanced, metastatic,\nrefractory, relapsed, or recurrent cancer. With an extensive panel of approximately 20,000 genes and 169 introns, the OncoExTra test is one of the most\ncomprehensive genomic (DNA) and transcriptomic (RNA) panels available today. We enable patients to take a more active role in their cancer care and make it\neasy for providers to order tests, interpret results, and personalize medicine.\n36\nTable of Contents\nInternational Business Background and Products\nWe commercialize or plan to commercialize our Oncotype® tests internationally through employees in Canada, Japan and a number of European countries, as\nwell as through exclusive distribution agreements. We have provided our Oncotype tests in approximately 120 countries outside of the U.S. We do not offer our\nCologuard test outside of the U.S.\nUpcoming Test Launches\nWe are preparing to launch in 2025 new screening and diagnostic tests to address unmet patient needs and enhance our existing products.\n• Cologuard Plus - Our Cologuard Plus test sets a new performance standard in non-invasive colorectal cancer screening. Our Cologuard Plus test\ndetects cancers and precancerous polyps with even greater sensitivity than our Cologuard test while reducing false positives by more than 30 percent.\nIn October 2024, the FDA approved our Cologuard Plus test for adults ages 45 and older of average risk for colorectal cancer. This approval was based\non results from our pivotal BLUE-C study, which showed 95% overall cancer sensitivity and 43% sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions at\n94% specificity when age-weighted to the U.S. population with no findings on colonoscopy. We expect to launch our Cologuard Plus test with\nMedicare coverage and guideline inclusion in 2025.\n• Oncodetect - We expect to launch our Oncodetect MRD test for patients with colorectal cancer, supported by forthcoming data releases and medical\njournal publications. We recently completed clinical validation of our tumor-informed platform utilizing colorectal cancer samples. Results will be\nsubmitted to MolDx for approval and subsequent Medicare reimbursement. Our tumor-informed Oncodetect test is designed to detect small amounts\nof tumor DNA that may remain in patients’ blood after they have undergone initial colorectal cancer treatment. This test will help patients and\noncologists understand the success of initial treatment, guide further treatment, and monitor for cancer recurrence.\nPipeline Research and Development\nWe are continuing to advance our pipeline of future screening and diagnostic products, including risk assessment, screening and prevention, early disease\ndiagnosis, adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant disease treatment, metastatic disease treatment selection, and patient monitoring.\nThrough our collaboration with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo”), we have successfully performed validation studies involving\nmultiple types of cancer using tissue, blood, and other sample types. Our research and development programs are also powered by technologies we have exclusively\nlicensed from The Johns Hopkins University, Broad Institute, Inc. (“Broad Institute”), Oxford University, the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, and TwinStrand\nBiosciences, Inc. (“TwinStrand”).\nWe are focusing our research and development efforts on three main areas:\n• Colorectal Cancer Screening. Over the past decade, together with Mayo, we have been seeking to develop even better colorectal cancer screening\ntests. Beyond Cologuard Plus, we are also working to develop a blood-based screening test for colorectal cancer. In September 2024, we presented\nperformance data for our blood-based colorectal cancer screening test at the ESMO Congress, showing sensitivities of 88% for colorectal cancer and\n31% for advanced precancerous lesions at specificity of 90% for negative samples confirmed by colonoscopy. BLUE-C pivotal study results for our\nblood-based colorectal cancer screening test are expected in the first half of 2025.\n37\nTable of Contents\n• MRD Test Development. In addition to our expected 2025 launch of Oncodetect for patients with colorectal cancer, we plan to validate Oncodetect for\nother cancer types, including breast cancer, and continually enhance the performance characteristics of our MRD test offerings over time. We recently\ncompleted clinical validation of our tumor-informed platform utilizing colorectal cancer samples. Results will be submitted to MolDx for approval and\nsubsequent Medicare reimbursement. In June 2023, we entered into a sponsored research agreement and exclusive license agreement with Broad\nInstitute to utilize their Minor Allele Enriched Sequencing Through Recognition Oligonucleotides (“MAESTRO”) diagnostic testing technology to\nfurther our ability to develop and launch impactful MRD tests. We are developing the MAESTRO platform for use in certain future MRD tests.\n• Multi-cancer Screening Test Development. We are currently seeking to develop a multi-cancer screening test, which will be branded as\nCancerguardTM, to help detect many different types of cancer from a single blood draw. ASCEND-2, a multi-center, prospective, case-control study of\nover 11,000 clinically characterized participants, validates the sensitivity and specificity of our multi-biomarker class approach across a broad range of\ncancer types, including the most aggressive cancers and cancers with no current standard of care for screening. We presented initial ASCEND-2 data\nin April 2024 at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) annual meeting, which demonstrated the ability to detect cancer signals\nfrom 21 cancer types with a mean sensitivity of 50.9% with 98.5% specificity and 56.8% sensitivity when breast and prostate cancer were excluded\nfrom the analysis. We plan to share additional analyses from ASCEND-2 at an upcoming scientific conference. Our multi-cancer screening test was\nrecently approved by the FDA to be used within a real-world evidence study, providing an opportunity to test 25,000 people over the next three years.\nThe first patient was enrolled within this study at Baylor Scott & White, the primary study site, in August 2024. In the future, we plan to begin\nrecruiting patients for the FDA registrational Study of All comeRs (“SOAR”) trial, which we expect to be the largest prospective, interventional multi-\ncancer screening trial ever conducted in the U.S.\nResearch and development, which includes our clinical study programs, accounts for a material portion of our operating expenses. As we seek to enhance our\nproduct portfolio and advance our pipeline, we expect that our research and development expenditures will continue to be a significant portion of our operating\nexpenditures.\n2024 Priorities\nOur top priorities for 2024 are to (1) focus on our people and customers, (2) bring our portfolio to life, and (3) magnify our impact.\nFocus on our People and Customers\nWe want to continue to provide an exceptional experience for our patients and team members. We plan to improve customer relations by delivering simple and\nsmooth workflows, providing communication that is clear and easy to understand, and providing results that are fast and accurate. We will also strive to ensure that\nExact Sciences remains a great place to work by taking care of our people.\nBring our Portfolio to Life\nWe will focus on advancing new tests in our highest priority programs including colorectal cancer screening, MRD, and multi-cancer screening. We plan to\ncontinue investing in our clinical trials to enhance existing products and bring new products to patients and providers, including obtaining FDA approval and\nsecuring coverage for our next generation Cologuard test, Cologuard Plus.\nMagnify our Impact\nWe are committed to improving lives through testing more people with our laboratory testing services in 2024 including expanding screening access to\nunderserved populations. By testing more people, we will continue to expand our business in a cost-efficient manner allowing us to generate sustainable profits and\nincrease shareholder value. Generating sustained profits will put the company in a better position to continue investing in life-changing cancer diagnostics to help\nachieve our mission.\n38\nTable of Contents\nRecent Developments and Trends\nWe estimate there are up to 60 million Americans that are not up to date with their colon cancer screenings. The capacity for screening colonoscopies in the\nU.S. is relatively fixed because it is dependent on the number of gastroenterologists available to perform the procedures. Health systems, payers, and health care\nproviders are motivated to increase screening rates because they are measured as part of the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) and\nMedicare Stars quality measure systems. More health systems and payers are recognizing the opportunity to partner with Exact Sciences to address their screening\nrates and related quality measures through large, organized screening programs. We aim to partner with them to implement our Cologuard test within these\nprograms as a solution for patients who infrequently visit their health care provider. Cologuard utilization is increasing in this setting, helping us screen more\nAmericans.\nWe have an opportunity to impact even more lives by increasing adoption of Oncotype DX tests internationally. In 2023, we secured reimbursement for the\nOncotype DX test in Japan. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Japanese women, with about 45,000 new diagnoses of early-stage HR+, HER2- breast\ncancer each year. With reimbursement in place, we estimate our Oncotype DX test could help more than 100 women per day understand if their cancer is likely to\nrecur and whether chemotherapy should be used in their treatment plan.\nResults of Operations\nWe have incurred losses since our inception and, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $3.63 billion. While our operating\nresults have continued to improve, we expect to incur net losses for the near future, and it is possible we may never become profitable or sustain profitability.\nRevenue. Our Screening revenue primarily includes laboratory service revenue from our Cologuard and Prevention Genetics, LLC (“PreventionGenetics”)\ntests while our Precision Oncology revenue primarily includes laboratory service revenue from global Oncotype DX and therapy selection tests.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nScreening $ 544.9 $ 472.0 $ 72.9\nPrecision Oncology 163.8 156.3 7.4\nTotal $ 708.7 $ 628.3 $ 80.3\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nScreening $ 1,551.3 $ 1,378.0 $ 173.3\nPrecision Oncology 494.1 468.9 25.2\nCOVID-19 Testing — 6.0 (6.0)\nTotal $ 2,045.4 $ 1,852.9 $ 192.5\nThe increase in Screening revenue was mainly due to an increase in the number of completed Cologuard tests. The increase in completed Cologuard tests for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to growth across all customer segments, more patients rescreening with our Cologuard test, and\nexpansion of organized screening programs run by payers and health systems. The increase in Precision Oncology revenue was mainly due to an increase in the\nnumber of completed Oncotype DX breast cancer tests, both domestically and internationally, led by an increased number of ordering providers outside the U.S.,\nspecifically in Japan. We discontinued our COVID-19 testing business in the second quarter of 2023 due to lower demand, which led to the decrease in COVID-19\ntesting revenue. A discussion on our COVID-19 testing business was provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAdjustments to revenue recognized during the period relating to prior period estimates were less than 1% of revenue recorded in our condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Adjustments to revenue recognized during the period relating to prior period\nestimates were less than 2% of revenue recorded in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe impact to revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to improvements made in our billing systems and processes, including\ninternational contracting and collections.\nWe expect continuing revenue growth for our Cologuard and Oncotype tests subject to seasonal variability. Our revenues are affected by the test volume of our\nproducts, patient adherence rates, payer mix, the levels of reimbursement, our order to cash operations, and payment patterns of payers and patients.\nCost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets). The increase in cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nwas primarily due to an increase in production costs, personnel expenses, and facility and support services, which was a result of an increase in completed\nCologuard and Oncotype tests and the corresponding increase in headcount to support the increase in tests completed. Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of\nacquired intangible assets) as a percentage of revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023,\nprimarily due to higher Cologuard test volume from organized screening programs run by payers and health systems. We expect that cost of sales will generally\ncontinue to increase in future periods as a result of an increase in our existing laboratory testing services and as we launch our pipeline products. We also expect to\nsee a corresponding increase in personnel and support services associated with this growth.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nProduction costs $ 125.6 $ 102.6 $ 23.0\nPersonnel expenses 48.2 45.8 2.4\nFacility and support services 17.3 13.6 3.7\nStock-based compensation 4.9 5.3 (0.4)\nOther cost of sales expenses 0.1 1.2 (1.1)\nTotal cost of sales expense $ 196.1 $ 168.5 $ 27.6\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nProduction costs $ 341.6 $ 289.2 $ 52.4\nPersonnel expenses 146.4 134.4 12.0\nFacility and support services 50.4 40.3 10.1\nStock-based compensation 15.7 15.6 0.1\nOther cost of sales expenses 1.9 2.9 (1.0)\nTotal cost of sales expense $ 556.0 $ 482.4 $ 73.6\n40\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due\nto a decrease in resources needed to support our ongoing clinical studies as discussed in further detail above. The increase in research and development expenses for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the termination of a license agreement with The Translational Genomics Research Institute\n(“TGen”) resulting in the recognition of an expense of $25.8 million in the second quarter of 2024. In addition, personnel expenses grew for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 is primarily due to an increase in average headcount during the year. This was partially offset by a decrease in direct research and development\ncosts as discussed above. We expect that research and development expenses will generally continue to increase in future periods as we continue to invest to\nadvance new tests.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nPersonnel expenses $ 43.7 $ 44.3 $ (0.6)\nDirect research and development 28.4 36.6 (8.2)\nFacility and support services 14.4 17.0 (2.6)\nStock-based compensation 9.3 10.5 (1.2)\nProfessional fees 3.2 2.3 0.9\nOther research and development 1.1 0.7 0.4\nTotal research and development expenses $ 100.1 $ 111.4 $ (11.3)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nPersonnel expenses $ 141.0 $ 129.9 $ 11.1\nDirect research and development 81.2 96.1 (14.9)\nFacility and support services 43.0 46.5 (3.5)\nStock-based compensation 31.1 31.0 0.1\nLicense agreement termination 25.8 — 25.8\nProfessional fees 7.7 5.5 2.2\nOther research and development 1.8 2.0 (0.2)\nTotal research and development expenses $ 331.6 $ 311.0 $ 20.6\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 due to continued investment in high impact sales and marketing opportunities. We anticipate sales and marketing expenses\nwill generally increase in future periods as we reinvest in sales and marketing to meet demand for current products and the launch of new products, while\ncontinuing to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time, driven by the growth of Cologuard and Oncotype testing services.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nPersonnel expenses $ 110.6 $ 99.7 $ 10.9\nDirect marketing costs 49.3 39.4 9.9\nProfessional and legal fees 15.4 12.1 3.3\nStock-based compensation 14.5 17.5 (3.0)\nFacility and support services 4.5 4.0 0.5\nOther sales and marketing expenses 0.4 0.5 (0.1)\nTotal sales and marketing expenses $ 194.7 $ 173.2 $ 21.5\n41\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nPersonnel expenses $ 326.9 $ 310.8 $ 16.1\nDirect marketing costs 145.2 131.3 13.9\nStock-based compensation 44.8 48.8 (4.0)\nProfessional and legal fees 44.3 30.7 13.6\nFacility and support services 10.0 12.6 (2.6)\nOther sales and marketing expenses 1.1 2.4 (1.3)\nTotal sales and marketing expenses $ 572.3 $ 536.6 $ 35.7\nGeneral and administrative expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due\nto a reduction in certain incentive-based compensation arrangements and a reduction in other discretionary spend including professional and legal fees as a result of\nour cost savings measures that were implemented. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\nprimarily due to the settlement of certain legal matters in 2023, as further described in Note 15 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023.These reductions were partially offset by increases in other general and administrative expense as a result of the change in fair value of our outstanding\ncontingent consideration liabilities. Refer to Note 7 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further\ndiscussion of our outstanding contingent consideration liabilities. We expect general and administrative expenses throughout the remainder of 2024 will remain\nrelatively consistent with costs incurred thus far in 2024. We expect general and administrative expenses will decrease over time as we leverage efficiencies in our\npersonnel and information technology systems.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nPersonnel expenses $ 98.1 $ 101.3 $ (3.2)\nFacility and support services 48.8 45.9 2.9\nProfessional and legal fees 30.8 34.5 (3.7)\nStock-based compensation 20.1 28.6 (8.5)\nOther general and administrative 19.4 7.1 12.3\nTotal general and administrative expenses $ 217.2 $ 217.4 $ (0.2)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts in millions 2024 2023 Change\nPersonnel expenses $ 312.2 $ 294.0 $ 18.2\nFacility and support services 138.0 133.2 4.8\nProfessional and legal fees 98.1 136.2 (38.1)\nStock-based compensation 74.1 77.3 (3.2)\nOther general and administrative 39.8 32.0 7.8\nTotal general and administrative expenses $ 662.2 $ 672.7 $ (10.5)\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased to $24.4 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to $23.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased to $71.1 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to $68.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to amortization of the\nintangible asset acquired as part of our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience in September 2023 and our acquisition of intellectual property through a license from\nTwinStrand in July 2024.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets was $18.7 million and $31.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, compared to zero and $0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impairment charges recorded during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to the closure of certain of our domestic facilities.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOther operating income. Other operating income was $3.1 million and $6.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\n$72.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents\nthe remeasurement of the contingent consideration asset from the sale of the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score test to MDxHealth SA (“MDxHealth”). The\nincome recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a $68.9 million contingent consideration gain and $3.1 million in additional\nconsideration received from MDxHealth.\nInvestment income, net. Investment income, net increased to $11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.1 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. Investment income, net increased to $29.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\n$7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The investment income recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nwas primarily due to gains recorded on our marketable securities.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $7.9 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Interest expense recorded from our outstanding convertible notes totaled $8.9 million and $6.3 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense increased to $17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $11.6 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense recorded from our outstanding convertible notes totaled $23.6 million and $17.3 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense included a net gain on settlement of convertible notes of $10.3 million and $10.3 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The convertible notes are further described in Note 9 of our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased to $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $0.2 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense increased to $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.0 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to current\nforeign and state tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe have incurred losses since our inception, and have historically financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock and\nconvertible debt and through revenue generated by the sale of our laboratory testing services. We expect our operating expenditures to continue to increase to\nsupport future growth of our laboratory testing services, as well as an increase in research and development and clinical trial costs to support the advancement of\nour pipeline products and bringing new tests to market. We expect that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at September 30, 2024, along with\ncash flows generated through our operations, will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next twelve months based on current operating plans.\nWe have access to a revolving line-of-credit (the “Revolver”) of up to $150.0 million, which had its maturity date extended to November 2025 through an\namended agreement in October 2022. The Revolver is collateralized by certain marketable securities which must continue to maintain a minimum market value of\n$150.0 million. PNC Bank, National Association has issued letters of credit totaling $4.4 million, which reduces the amount available for cash advances under the\nline of credit to $145.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had not drawn any funds under the Revolver. The Revolver is further described in Note 8 of our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe may raise additional capital to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons. If we\nare unable to obtain sufficient additional funds to enable us to fund our business plans and strategic investments, our results of operations and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to delay the implementation of our plans or otherwise scale back our operations. There can be no\ncertainty that we will ever be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations to achieve and maintain profitability and meet all of our obligations as\nthey come due.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $588.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and approximately $432.3 million in marketable\nsecurities.\nThe majority of our investments in marketable securities consist of fixed income investments, and all are deemed available-for-sale. The objectives of this\nportfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types\nof instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.\nCash Flows\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAmounts In millions 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 163.5 $ 86.6\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (400.3) 116.4\nNet cash provided by financing activities 221.4 149.7\nOperating activities\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in revenue. This was\npartially offset by an increase in operating expenses and cost of sales to support the increase in revenue as discussed in the Results of Operations section above and\ntiming of payments on our accounts payable and accrued expenses and collections of our accounts receivable.\nInvesting activities\nThe increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 was due to a net increase of $507.4 million in cash used for purchases, maturities and sales of marketable securities as a result of\na change in investing strategy towards more fixed income securities compared to money market funds as money market yields have decreased. We also increased\nour purchases of property, plant and equipment by $10.4 million due to additional investments in information technology infrastructure and lab automation. The\nincrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash used related to business combinations and asset acquisitions. We made\npayments of $45.0 million for our license of intellectual property from TwinStrand during the third quarter of 2024 compared to a cash payment of $50.0 for our\nacquisition of Resolution Bioscience, Inc. in the third quarter of 2023.\nFinancing activities\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 was primarily due to proceeds of $266.8 million from the issuance of convertible notes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to proceeds of $138.0 million\nfrom the issuance of convertible notes in the first quarter of 2023. This was partially offset by a payment of $50.0 million in settlement of our previously\noutstanding accounts receivable securitization facility (“Securitization Facility”) upon maturity in June 2024.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nA discussion of our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2023 was provided in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operation of our 2023 Form 10-K. Other than the matters described below, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of our\nbusiness in our specified material cash requirements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n44\nTable of Contents\nIn April 2024, we entered into privately negotiated agreements (the “Agreements”) with certain holders of our convertible notes due in 2028 (“2028 Notes”).\nPursuant to the Agreements, we issued $620.7 million aggregate principal amount of a new series of Convertible Notes due in 2031 (the “2031 Notes”) in exchange\nfor (i) the retirement of $359.7 million in aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes, and (ii) payment to the Company of $266.8 million in cash. The net proceeds\nfrom the issuance of the Notes were approximately $259.8 million, after deducting commissions and the offering expenses payable by the Company. The 2031\nNotes mature on April 15, 2031 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year,\nbeginning on October 15, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding aggregate principal of $249.2 million on our convertible notes with a maturity date of January 15, 2025 (the\n“2025 Notes”), which are classified as convertible notes, net, current portion on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Beginning July 15, 2024, which is six\nmonths prior to the maturity date of the 2025 Notes, holders of the 2025 Notes may elect to convert such notes at any time. In accordance with the terms of the 2025\nNotes, any 2025 Notes that are converted after July 15, 2024 will be settled through a combination settlement under which the par value will be settled in cash and\nany amount in excess of par value will be settled in shares of our common stock. 2025 Notes that are not converted prior to the maturity date will be settled in cash\nupon maturity.\nIn June 2024, we repaid the previously outstanding balance of $50.0 million in full upon maturity of the Securitization Facility. Prior to maturity, the\nSecuritization Facility accrued interest at a rate equal to a daily secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus a SOFR adjustment and an applicable margin. The\ninterest rate was 6.87% as of the maturity date.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we\nevaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the\ncircumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other\nsources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our 2023 Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and our outstanding variable-rate debt. We invest\nour cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in securities of the U.S. governments and its agencies and in investment-grade, highly liquid investments\nconsisting of commercial paper, bank certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were classified as\navailable-for-sale. We place our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities with high-quality financial institutions, limit the amount of credit\nexposure to any one institution, and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity.\nBased on a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial\ninstruments, and cash flows are immaterial, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis. While we believe our cash, cash\nequivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that, in the future, our investments will\nnot be subject to adverse changes\n45\nTable of Contents\nin market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities at one or more financial\ninstitutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given the potential instability of financial institutions, we cannot provide assurance that we will not\nexperience losses on these deposits. We do not utilize interest rate hedging agreements or other interest rate derivative instruments.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding variable rate debt. If we were to draw down amounts under our Revolving Loan, we would be impacted by\nincreases in prevailing market interest rates. All of our other significant interest-bearing liabilities bear interest at fixed rates and therefore are not subject to\nfluctuations in market interest rates; however, because these interest rates are fixed, we may be paying a higher interest rate, relative to market, in the future if\ncircumstances change.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe functional currency for most of our international subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, and as a result we are not subject to material gains and losses from foreign\ncurrency translation of the subsidiary financial statements. Substantially all of our revenues are recognized in U.S. dollars, although a small portion is denominated\nin foreign currency as we continue to expand into markets outside of the U.S. Certain expenses related to our international activities are payable in foreign\ncurrencies. As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets will affect our financial results.\nWe enter into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of adverse movements in foreign exchange rates related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and\nliabilities and hedge our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. As of September 30, 2024, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional\namounts of $47.7 million. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has been immaterial in the past, there can be no guarantee that the\nimpact of currency fluctuations related to our international activities will not be material in the future.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including\nour principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-\n15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and\nour principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Disclosure controls and procedures\nenable us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our Exchange Act filings within the required time period. Our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the periodic reports filed with the\nSEC is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive, financial and accounting officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere have been no significant changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n46\nTable of Contents\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Legal proceedings, including litigation,\ngovernment investigations and enforcement actions could result in material costs, occupy significant management resources and entail civil and criminal penalties.\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated by reference to the information in Note 13 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in\nPart I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results,\nsome of which are beyond our control.

The Plan is designed to encourage eligible employees to remain in the employ of the Company and its Participating Subsidiaries.\nIt is intended that a component of the Plan constitutes an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code” and such component, the “423 Component”) and the 423 Component shall be interpreted in accordance with that\nintent (although the Company makes no undertaking or representation to maintain such qualification).\nIn addition, this Plan authorizes the grant of Options (as defined in Article 5) under a component of the Plan that does not qualify as an “employee stock\npurchase plan” under Section 423 of the Code (such component, the “Non-423 Component”). Such Options granted under the Non-423 Component shall be granted\npursuant to such sub-plans, appendices, rules or procedures as may be adopted by the Committee (as defined in Article 2) to achieve tax, securities laws or other\nobjectives for the eligible employees and the Participating Subsidiaries designated for participation in the Non-423 Component. Except as otherwise provided\nherein or by the Committee, the Non-423 Component will operate and be administered in the same manner as the 423 Component.\nFor purposes of this Plan, the Committee may designate separate offerings under the Plan in which eligible employees will participate, the terms of which\nneed not be identical even if the dates of the applicable Offering Periods of such offerings are identical, provided that the terms of participation are the same within\neach separate offering under the 423 Component as determined under Section 423 of the Code. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, each offering under\nthe Plan in which employee of one or more Participating Subsidiaries may participate shall be deemed a separate offering for purposes of Section 423 of the Code,\neven if the dates of the applicable Offering Periods of each such offering are identical, and the provisions of the Plan shall separately apply to each offering.\nArticle 2—Administration of the Plan.\nThe Plan may be administered by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company (the \"Committee\"). The Board of Directors may from\ntime to time remove members from, or add members to, the Committee. Vacancies on the Committee, howsoever caused, shall be filled by the Board of Directors.\nThe Committee may select one of its members as Chairman, and shall hold meetings at such times and places as it may determine. Acts by a majority of the\nCommittee, or acts reduced to or approved in writing by a majority of the members of the Committee, shall be the valid acts of the Committee.\nThe Committee has authority at any time to: (i) adopt, alter and repeal such rules, guidelines and practices for the administration of the Plan and for its own\nacts and proceedings as it shall deem advisable; (ii) interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan; (iii) determine when and how Options shall be granted and the\nprovisions and terms of each offering (which need not be identical between offerings); (iv) determine eligibility for participation in the Plan, including which\nsubsidiaries of the Company will be Participating Subsidiaries and whether such Participating Subsidiaries participate in the 423 Component or the Non-423\nComponent (within the limits of the Plan); (v) make all determinations it deems advisable for the administration of the Plan; (vi) decide all disputes arising in\nconnection with the Plan; and (vii) otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan. Further, the\n1\nCommittee may adopt sub-plans, appendices, rules or procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements\nof local laws and procedures, provided that the adoption and implementation of any such sub-plans, appendices rules and/or procedures would not cause the 423\nComponent to violate Section 423 of the Code.\nAll interpretations and decisions of the Committee shall be binding on all persons, including the Company and the participants. No member of the Board of\nDirectors or individual exercising administrative authority with respect to the Plan shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to\nthe Plan or any Option granted hereunder.\nIn the event the Board of Directors fails to appoint or refrains from appointing a Committee, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the\nBoard of Directors shall have all power and authority to administer the Plan. In such event, the word \"Committee\" wherever used herein shall be deemed to mean\nthe Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nTo the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Committee may, from time to time, delegate some or all of its authority under the Plan to a\nsubcommittee or subcommittees of the Committee, to one or more of the Company’s officers or management team, or to other persons or groups of persons as it\ndeems necessary, appropriate or advisable under conditions or limitations that it may set at or after the time of the delegation. For purposes of the Plan, reference to\nthe Committee will be deemed to include any subcommittee, subcommittees, or other persons or groups of persons to whom the Committee delegates authority\npursuant to this provision.\nArticle 3—Eligible Employees.\nAll employees of the Company or any of its Participating Subsidiaries who are employed on or before the forty-fifth (45th) day (or such other period of\ntime not to exceed two (2) years) prior to the beginning of an Offering Period and whose customary employment at such time is more than 20 hours per week and\nfor more than five months in any calendar year shall be eligible to receive Options under the Plan to purchase shares of Common Stock, provided that the\nCommittee may allow employees whose customary employment is below these thresholds to be considered as eligible employees, including where applicable law\nrequires that such employees be considered as eligible employees, subject in all cases to the provisions of this Article 3 and the requirements set forth in Article 7\nhereof.\nAn employee who works for a Participating Subsidiary and is a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction other than the United States (without regard to whether\nsuch individual also is a citizen or resident of the United States or is a resident alien (within the meaning of Section 7701(b)(1)(A) of the Code)) may be excluded\nfrom participation in the Plan or an offering if the participation of such employee is prohibited under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction or if complying with the\nlaws of the applicable jurisdiction would cause the Plan or an offering under the 423 Component to violate Section 423 of the Code. In the case of the Non-423\nComponent, an employee (or group of employees) may be excluded from participation in the Plan if the Committee has determined, in its sole discretion, that\nparticipation of such employee(s) is not advisable or practicable for any reason.\nIn no event may an employee be granted an Option if such employee, immediately after the Option was granted, would be treated as owning stock\npossessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any parent corporation or subsidiary\ncorporation, as the terms \"parent corporation\" and \"subsidiary corporation\" are defined in Section 424(e) and (f) of the Code. For purposes of determining stock\nownership under this paragraph, the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply, and stock which the employee may purchase under outstanding Options shall\nbe treated as stock owned by the employee.\nArticle 4—Stock Subject to the Plan.\nThe stock subject to the Options under the Plan shall be shares of the Company's authorized but unissued common stock, par value $.01 per share (the\n\"Common Stock\"), or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including shares purchased in the open market. The aggregate number of shares of\nCommon Stock which\n2\nmay be issued pursuant to the Plan is 5,800,000 subject to adjustment as provided in Article 12. If any Option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate for\nany reason without having been exercised in full or shall cease for any reason to be exercisable in whole or in part, the unpurchased shares subject thereto shall\nagain be available under the Plan. For avoidance of doubt, up to the maximum number of Shares reserved under this Article 4 may be used to satisfy purchases of\nshares of Common Stock under the 423 Component and any remaining portion of such maximum number of shares of Common Stock may be used to satisfy\npurchases of shares of Common Stock under the Non-423 Component.\nArticle 5—Offering Period and Stock Options.\nThe Plan shall be implemented by consecutive or overlapping Offering Periods, with a new Offering Period commencing on the first day of the relevant\nOffering Period and terminating on the last day of the relevant Offering Period (an “Offering Period”). The Offering Periods shall: (a) consist of one or more dates\nwithin each Offering Period on which shares of Common Stock may be purchased by participants in an Offering Period specified by the Committee prior to the\nscheduled beginning of the applicable Offering Period, to the extent they differ from the Exercise Dates set forth below (\"Exercise Date(s)\"); and (b) be of a\nduration, and commence on the dates, specified by the Committee prior to the scheduled beginning of the applicable Offering Period, to the extent they differ from\nthe Offering Periods set forth below, provided that each Offering Period may not have a duration exceeding twenty-seven (27) months. Offering Periods under the\nPlan that began prior to November 1, 2024, shall consist of twenty-four-month periods commencing on November 1 and May 1 of each calendar year. For Offering\nPeriods that began prior to November 1, 2024, there shall be four Exercise Dates occurring on each April 30 and October 31 (or, if such date is not a trading day, the\nfirst trading day thereafter) within each such Offering Period. Unless and until otherwise determined by the Committee, Offering Periods that begin on or after\nNovember 1, 2024, shall consist of six-month periods commencing on November 1 and May 1 of each calendar year. Unless and until otherwise determined by the\nCommittee, for Offering Periods beginning on or after November 1, 2024, there shall be one Exercise Date per Offering Period, occurring on April 30 for Offering\nPeriods that begin on November 1 and on October 31 for Offering Periods that begin on May 1 (or, if such Exercise Date is not a trading day, the first trading day\nthereafter). For the avoidance of any doubt, the Committee is vested with the authority to establish alternative sequential or overlapping Offering Periods, a\ndifferent number of Exercise Dates within an Offering Period, a different duration for one or more Offering Periods or different commencement or ending dates for\nsuch Offering Periods with respect to future Offering Periods in accordance with the provisions contemplated in this Article 5 without stockholder approval.\nOn the first business day at the beginning of each Offering Period, the Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a participant in the Plan\nan Option to purchase shares on the Exercise Dates (the \"Option\"), at the Option Price hereinafter provided for, a maximum of 10,000 shares of Common Stock or\nsuch other smaller maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be specified by the Committee prior to the scheduled beginning of the applicable\nOffering Period, on condition that such employee remains eligible to participate in the Plan on each Exercise Date. If the participant's accumulated payroll\ndeductions on the last date of the Offering Period would enable the participant to purchase more than the maximum number of shares provided herein except for the\nshare limitation set forth herein, the excess of the amount of the accumulated payroll deductions over the aggregate purchase price of the maximum number of\nShares of Common Stock that may be purchased in accordance with this Article 5 shall be promptly refunded to the participant by the Company, without interest.\nThe participant shall be entitled to exercise the Option so granted only to the extent of the participant's accumulated payroll deductions on the Exercise Date. The\noption price per share of Common Stock for each Exercise Date within an Offering Period shall be the lesser of (i) 85% of the average market price of the Common\nStock on the first business day of the Offering Period and (ii) 85% of the average market price of the Common Stock on the applicable Exercise Date, in either\nevent rounded up to the nearest cent (the \"Option Price\"). The foregoing limitation on the number of shares subject to Option and the Option Price shall be subject\nto adjustment as provided in Article 12.\nUnless a participant files a new authorization or withdraws from the Plan, the deductions and purchases under the authorization the participant has on file\nunder the Plan will continue from one Offering Period to succeeding (but not overlapping) Offering Periods as long as the Plan remains in effect. Notwithstanding\nany of the foregoing, to the extent that the Committee establishes multiple Exercise Dates within an Offering Period or\n3\noverlapping Offering Periods with an Exercise Date based (in part) on the average market price of the Common Stock on the first business day of an Offering\nPeriod, the Committee shall have discretion to structure an Offering Period such that if the average market price of the Common Stock on an Exercise Date is less\nthan or equal to the average market price of the Common Stock on the first business day of the Offering Period to which such Exercise Date relates, all participants\nshall be automatically withdrawn from such Offering Period immediately after the acquisition of shares of Common Stock for such Exercise Date and automatically\nenrolled in the immediately following Offering Period as of the first day thereof.\nFor purposes of the Plan, the term \"average market price\" on any date means (i) the average (on that date) of the high and low prices of the Common Stock\non the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is traded, if the Common Stock is then traded on a national securities exchange; or (ii)\nthe average of the closing bid and asked prices last quoted (on that date) by an established quotation service for over-the-counter securities, if the Common Stock is\nnot reported on the NASDAQ; or (iii) if the Common Stock is not publicly traded, the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined by the Committee\nafter taking into consideration all factors which it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the Common Stock in private\ntransactions negotiated at arm's length.\nFor purposes of the Plan, the term \"business day\" means a day on which there is trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market or the aforementioned national\nsecurities exchange, whichever is applicable pursuant to the preceding paragraph; and if neither is applicable, a day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday\nin State of Wisconsin.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, no participant may be granted an Option which permits his or her rights to purchase shares under the Plan, and any other\nemployee stock purchase plan of the Company or Subsidiaries, to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of the fair market value of such shares (determined on the\nOption grant date or dates) for each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at any time. The purpose of the limitation in the preceding sentence is to\ncomply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and shall be applied taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted. Solely with respect to the 423\nComponent, for Offering Periods beginning on or after May 1, 2023, once the participant's accumulated payroll deductions would enable the participant to purchase\nthe maximum amount of Common Stock permitted under the Section 423(b)(8) limitation described in this paragraph, payroll deductions will cease until the first\nday after the last Exercise Date in the calendar year in which accumulated payroll deductions reached such maximum amount. For both the 423 Component and the\nNon-423 Component, on any Exercise Date, if the participant’s accumulated payroll deductions would otherwise enable the participant to purchase Common Stock\nin excess of the Section 423(b)(8) limitation described in this paragraph, the excess of the amount over the accumulated payroll deductions over the aggregate\npurchase price of the shares actually purchased shall be promptly refunded to the participant by the Company, without interest.\nArticle 6—Exercise of Option.\nEach eligible employee who continues to be a participant in the Plan on an Exercise Date within an Offering Period shall be deemed to have exercised his\nor her Option on such date and shall be deemed to have purchased from the Company such number of full shares of Common Stock reserved for the purpose of the\nPlan as the participant's accumulated payroll deductions on such date will pay for at the Option Price, subject to the 10,000 maximum share limit (or other\nmaximum share limit, as applicable) of the Option and the Section 423(b)(8) limitation described in Article 5. Only full shares of Common Stock may be purchased\nunder the Plan, unless the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that fractional shares may be purchased under the Plan. Unless otherwise determined by the\nCommittee in advance of any Offering Period, unused payroll deductions remaining in a participant's account at the end of either an Exercise Date or an Offering\nPeriod, by reason of the inability to purchase a fractional share, shall be promptly refunded to the participant by the Company, without interest.\n4\nArticle 7—Authorization for Entering the Plan.\nAn employee may elect to enter the Plan by filling out, signing and delivering an authorization to the Company (in such form and according to such\nprocedures determined by the Committee which may include by electronic or other delivery). Such authorization shall:\nA. State the percentage to be deducted regularly from the employee's Compensation;\nB. Authorize the purchase of stock for the employee in each Offering Period in accordance with the terms of the Plan;\nC. Specify the exact name or names in which stock purchased for the employee is to be issued as provided under Article 11 hereof; and\nD. Include the employee's agreement any other terms and conditions for participation in the Plan that the Committee determines to be advisable.\nSuch authorization must be received by the Company at least ten days before the first day of the next Offering Period, or within such other time frame as\ndetermined by the Company and communicated to eligible employees, and shall take effect only if the employee is an eligible employee on the first business day of\nsuch Offering Period.\nAn employee cannot participate in more than one Offering Period at any time.\nUnless a participant files a new authorization or withdraws from the Plan, the deductions and purchases under the authorization the participant has on file\nunder the Plan will continue from one Offering Period to succeeding (but not overlapping) Offering Periods as long as the Plan remains in effect. The terms and\nconditions applicable to participation in the Plan in such successive Offering Periods shall be those in effect at the commencement of such successive Offering\nPeriods, as set forth in the Plan and the authorization documentation available to eligible employees at such time.\nThe Company will accumulate and hold for each participant's account the amounts deducted from his or her Compensation. No interest will be paid on\nthese amounts, unless required by applicable law. For purposes of the Plan, the term “Compensation” means the amount of base pay or wages (including 13th/14th\nmonth payments or similar concepts under local law), including, in the interest of clarity, paid time off, paid leaves of absence (including statutory paid leave) paid\nby the Company, and overtime (including on-call payments and shift differentials), quarterly sales incentive payments, and corporate year-end and quarter-end\nbonus awards, but excluding any other one-time payments, allowances, and reimbursements for expenses such as relocation allowances or travel expenses, income\nor gains related to other Company share-based awards, and similar items. For U.S. participants, Compensation will include elective amounts that are not includible\nin the participant’s gross income by reason of Sections 125, 132(f), or 401(k) of the Code. The Committee shall have the discretion to determine the application of\nthis definition to participants on payrolls outside of the United States.\nArticle 8—Maximum Amount of Payroll Deductions.\nAn employee may authorize payroll deductions in an amount (expressed as a whole percentage) not less than one percent (1%) but not more than fifteen\npercent (15%) of the employee's total Compensation.\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, in non-U.S. jurisdictions where participation in the Plan through payroll deductions is\nprohibited or otherwise problematic under applicable laws (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), the Committee may provide that an eligible\nemployee may elect to participate through other contributions in a form acceptable to the Committee in lieu of or in addition to payroll deductions, provided that,\nfor any offering under the 423 Component, the Committee must determine that any alternative method of contribution is applied on an equal and uniform basis to\nall eligible employees in the offering.\n5\nAny reference to “payroll deductions” in this Article 8 (or in any other section of the Plan) will similarly cover contributions by other means made pursuant to this\nArticle 8.\nArticle 9—Change in Payroll Deductions.\nPayroll deductions may not be increased or decreased during an Offering Period. However, a participant may withdraw in full from the Plan (as described\nin Article 10). The Committee may, in advance of any Offering Period, establish rules, procedures and deadlines permitting a participant to increase, decrease or\nterminate his or her payroll deductions during an Offering Period.\nArticle 10—Withdrawal from the Plan.\nA participant may withdraw from the Plan (in whole but not in part), within such time prior to the Exercise Date for such Offering Period as may be\nestablished by the Committee, by delivering a withdrawal notice to the Company (in such form and according to such procedures determined by the Committee\nwhich may include by electronic or other delivery). In the event a participant elects to withdraw from the Plan, amounts then credited to such participant's account\nshall be returned to the participant as soon as practicable after such election is received by the Company (without any interest thereon except as may be required by\napplicable local laws), the participant shall cease to participate in the Plan and the participant’s Option for such Offering Period shall terminate.\nTo re-enter the Plan, an employee who has previously withdrawn must file a new authorization at least ten days before the first day of the next Offering\nPeriod in which he or she wishes to participate, or within such other time frame as determined by the Company and communicated to eligible employees. The\nemployee's re-entry into the Plan becomes effective at the beginning of such Offering Period, provided that he or she is an eligible employee on the first business\nday of the Offering Period.\nArticle 11—Issuance of Stock.\nCertificates for stock issued to participants (or other indicia of ownership of such stock) shall be delivered as soon as practicable after each Exercise Date\nby the Company's transfer agent.\nStock purchased under the Plan shall be issued only in the name of the participant, or if the participant's authorization so specifies and if and to the extent\npermitted by the Company, in the name of the participant and another person of legal age as joint tenants with rights of survivorship.\nArticle 12—Adjustments.\nUpon the happening of any of the following described events, a participant's rights under Options granted under the Plan shall be adjusted as hereinafter\nprovided:\nA. In the event that the shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares or if, upon a\nreorganization, split-up, liquidation, recapitalization or the like of the Company, the shares of Common Stock shall be exchanged for other securities of the\nCompany, each participant shall be entitled, subject to the conditions herein stated, to purchase such number of shares of Common Stock or amount of\nother securities of the Company as were exchangeable for the number of shares of Common Stock that such participant would have been entitled to\npurchase except for such action, and appropriate adjustments shall be made in the purchase price per share to reflect such subdivision, combination or\nexchange; and\nB. In the event the Company shall issue any of its shares or other securities, including any of the shares of any of its subsidiaries, as a stock dividend\nupon or with respect to the shares of stock of the class which shall at the time be subject to Option hereunder, each participant upon exercising such an\nOption shall be entitled to receive (for the purchase price paid upon such exercise) the shares as to which the participant is exercising his or her Option and,\nin addition thereto (at no additional cost), such number of\n6\nshares of the class or classes in which such stock dividend or dividends were declared or paid, and such amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, as is\nequal to the number of shares thereof and the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, respectively, which the participant would have received if the\nparticipant had been the holder of the shares as to which the participant is exercising his or her Option at all times between the date of the granting of such\nOption and the date of its exercise.\nUpon the happening of any of the foregoing events (or in the event of an extraordinary cash dividend or other distribution that affects the shares of\nCommon Stock), the class and aggregate number of shares set forth in Article 4 hereof which are subject to Options which have been or may be granted under the\nPlan and the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Article 5 shall also be appropriately adjusted to reflect the events specified in paragraphs A and B\nabove. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to paragraphs A or B shall be made only after the Committee, based on advice of counsel for\nthe Company, determines whether such adjustments would constitute a \"modification\" (as that term is defined in Section 424 of the Code). If the Committee\ndetermines that such adjustments would constitute a modification, it may refrain from making such adjustments.\nIf the Company is to be consolidated with or acquired by another entity in a merger, a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or otherwise\n(an \"Acquisition\"), the Committee or the board of directors of any entity assuming the obligations of the Company hereunder (the \"Successor Board\") shall, with\nrespect to Options then outstanding under the Plan, either (i) make appropriate provision for the continuation of such Options by arranging for the substitution on an\nequitable basis for the shares then subject to such Options either (a) the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding shares of the Common Stock in\nconnection with the Acquisition, (b) shares of stock of the successor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary of such corporation, or (c) such other securities as the\nSuccessor Board deems appropriate, the fair market value of which shall not materially exceed the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock subject to such\nOptions immediately preceding the Acquisition; (ii) shorten the Offering Period with respect to which such Options relate by setting a new Exercise Date on which\nsuch Offering Period will end, with such new Exercise Date occurring before the effective date of the Acquisition, and provided that each participant shall be\nnotified of the new Exercise Date on which the Options will be exercised as provided in Article 6 hereof, unless prior to such date the participant has withdrawn\nfrom the Offering Period as provided in Article 10 hereof or the participant has ceased to be an eligible employee as provided in Article 14 hereof; or (iii) terminate\neach participant's Option in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of (a) the fair market value, on the date of the Acquisition, of the number of shares of\nCommon Stock that the participant's accumulated payroll deductions as of the date of the Acquisition could purchase, at an Option Price determined with reference\nonly to the first business day of the applicable Offering Period and subject to the maximum share limitation set forth in Article 5 hereof, Code Section 423(b)(8) and\nfractional-share limitations on the amount of stock a participant would be entitled to purchase, over (b) the result of multiplying such number of shares by such\nOption Price.\nThe Committee or Successor Board, as applicable, shall determine the adjustments to be made under this Article 12, and its determination shall be\nconclusive.\nArticle 13—No Transfer or Assignment of Employee's Rights.\nAn Option granted under the Plan may not be transferred or assigned, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercised, during\nthe participant's lifetime, only by the participant.\nArticle 14—Termination of Employee's Rights; Transfer of Employment.\nWhenever a participant ceases to be an eligible employee because of retirement, voluntary or involuntary termination, resignation, layoff, discharge, death\nor for any other reason, his or her rights under the Plan shall immediately terminate, and the Company shall promptly refund, without interest (except where\notherwise required by applicable law), the entire balance of his or her payroll deduction account under the Plan.\nA participant will be deemed to have terminated employment, for this purpose, if the corporation that employs him or her, having been a Participating\nSubsidiary, ceases to be a subsidiary or to be designated as a\n7\nParticipating Subsidiary, or if the employee is transferred to any corporation other than the Company or a Participating Subsidiary. A participant will not be deemed\nto have terminated employment for this purpose, if the participant is on an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness or for any other purpose\napproved by the Company for up to 90 days, or if the employee’s right to reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant\nto which the leave of absence was granted or if the Committee otherwise provides in writing, if longer than 90 days.\nIf a participant transfers employment from the Company or any Participating Subsidiary participating in the 423 Component to any Participating\nSubsidiary participating in the Non-423 Component, such transfer shall not be treated as a termination of employment, but the participant shall immediately cease\nto participate in the 423 Component; however, any contributions made for the Offering Period in which such transfer occurs shall be transferred to the Non-423\nComponent, and such participant shall immediately join the then-current offering under the Non-423 Component upon the same terms and conditions in effect for\nthe participant’s participation in the 423 Component, except for such modifications otherwise applicable for participants in such offering. A participant who\ntransfers employment from any Participating Subsidiary participating in the Non-423 Component to the Company or any Participating Subsidiary participating in\nthe 423 Component shall not be treated as terminating the participant’s employment and shall remain a participant in the Non-423 Component until the earlier of\n(i) the end of the current Offering Period under the Non-423 Component, or (ii) the Offering Date of the first Offering Period in which the participant is eligible to\nparticipate following such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may establish different rules to govern transfers of employment between\ncompanies participating in the 423 Component and the Non-423 Component, consistent with the applicable requirements of Section 423 of the Code.\nArticle 15—Termination and Amendments to Plan.\nUnless terminated sooner as provided below, the Plan shall terminate on October 31, 2030. The Plan may be terminated at any time by the Company's\nBoard of Directors but such termination shall not affect Options then outstanding under the Plan. It will terminate in any case when all or substantially all of the\nunissued shares of stock reserved for the purposes of the Plan have been purchased. If at any time shares of stock reserved for the purpose of the Plan remain\navailable for purchase but not in sufficient number to satisfy all then unfilled purchase requirements, the available shares shall be apportioned among participants in\nproportion to the amount of payroll deductions accumulated on behalf of each participant that would otherwise be used to purchase stock, and the Plan shall\nterminate. Upon such termination or any other termination of the Plan, all payroll deductions not used to purchase stock will be refunded, without interest (unless\notherwise required under applicable law).\nThe Committee or the Board of Directors may from time to time adopt amendments to the Plan, provided that, without the approval of the stockholders of\nthe Company, no amendment may (i) increase the number of shares that may be issued under the Plan; (ii) change the class of employees eligible to receive Options\nunder the Plan, if such action would be treated as the adoption of a new plan for purposes of Section 423(b) of the Code; or (iii) cause Rule 16b-3 under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to become inapplicable to the Plan; (iv) otherwise be made to the extent stockholder approval is required under applicable law.\nArticle 16—Limits on Sale of Stock Purchased under the Plan.\nThe Plan is intended to provide shares of Common Stock for investment and not for resale. The Company does not, however, intend to restrict or influence\nany employee in the conduct of his or her own affairs. An employee may, therefore, sell stock purchased under the Plan at any time the employee chooses, subject\nto compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws or other applicable securities or other laws and subject to any restrictions imposed under Article\n23 to ensure that tax withholding obligations are satisfied. THE EMPLOYEE ASSUMES THE RISK OF ANY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE\nOF THE STOCK.\n8\nArticle 17—Participating Subsidiaries.\nThe term \"Participating Subsidiary\" shall mean any present or future “subsidiary” of the Company, as that term is defined in Section 424(f) of the Code,\nthat has been designated by the Committee from time to time, in its sole discretion, as eligible to participate in the Plan, such designation to specify whether such\nparticipation is in the 423 Component or Non-423 Component. A Participating Subsidiary may participate in either the 423 Component or Non-423 Component, but\nnot both. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any subsidiary is disregarded for U.S. tax purposes in respect of the Company or any Participating Subsidiary\nparticipating in the 423 Component, then such disregarded subsidiary shall automatically be a Participating Subsidiary participating in the 423 Component. If any\nsubsidiary is disregarded for U.S. tax purposes in respect of any Participating Subsidiary participating in the Non-423 Component, the Committee may exclude such\nsubsidiary from participating in the Plan, notwithstanding that the Participating Subsidiary in respect of which such subsidiary is disregarded may participate in the\nPlan. The Committee may so designate any subsidiary, or revoke any such designation, at any time and from time to time, either before or after the Plan is approved\nby the stockholders.\nArticle 18—Optionees Not Stockholders.\nNeither the granting of an Option to an employee nor the deductions from an employee's Compensation shall constitute such employee a stockholder of the\nshares covered by an Option until such shares have been actually purchased by the employee.\nArticle 19—Section 409A.\nThe 423 Component of the Plan and the Options granted pursuant to an Offering Period are intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A of\nthe Code. Neither the Non-423 Component nor any Option granted pursuant to an Offering Period thereunder is intended to constitute or provide for “nonqualified\ndeferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the Committee determines\nthat any Option granted under the Plan may be or become subject to Section 409A of the Code or that any provision of the Plan may cause an Option granted under\nthe Plan to be or become subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and/or adopt other policies and procedures\n(including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions as the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to\navoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code, either through compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or with an available\nexemption therefrom.\nArticle 20—Application of Funds.\nThe proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to Options granted under the Plan will be used for general corporate\npurposes.\nArticle 21—Notice to Company of Disposition.\nBy electing to participate in the Plan, each participant agrees to notify the Company in writing immediately after the participant transfers Common Stock\nacquired under the Plan. Each participant further agrees to provide any information about such a transfer as may be requested by the Company or any subsidiary\ncorporation in order to assist it in complying with the tax laws. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to require participants to hold\nany shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan with a designated broker or other third party to facilitate compliance with the applicable reporting and other\ncompliance requirements.\nArticle 22—Withholding of Additional Income Taxes.\nBy electing to participate in the Plan, each participant acknowledges that the Company and its Participating Subsidiaries are required to withhold any Tax-\nRelated Items with respect to the amounts deducted from the participant's Compensation and accumulated for the benefit of the participant under the Plan, and each\nparticipant\n9\nagrees that the Company and Participating Subsidiaries may deduct additional amounts from the participant's Compensation, when amounts are added to the\nparticipant's account, used to purchase shares of Common Stock or refunded, in order to satisfy such withholding obligations.\nAt the time a participant’s Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time a participant disposes of some or all of the shares of Common Stock\nacquired under the Plan (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), the participant will make adequate provision for the payment and/or\nwithholding of any Tax-Related Items. In their sole discretion, and except as otherwise determined by the Committee, the Company or a Participating Subsidiary\nthat employs the participant may satisfy their obligations to withhold Tax-Related Items by (a) withholding from the participant’s wages or other cash\ncompensation, (b) withholding a number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable following the exercise of the Option, (c) withholding from proceeds from\nthe sale of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise, either through a voluntary sale or a mandatory sale arranged by the Company, or (d) withholding by any\nother means determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and in compliance with applicable law.\nFor purposes of this Article 23, “Tax-Related Items” means any U.S. and non-U.S. federal, provincial, state and/or local taxes (including, without\nlimitation, income tax, social insurance contributions, fringe benefit tax, employment tax, stamp tax and any employer tax liability which has been transferred to a\nparticipant) for which a participant is liable in connection with participation in the Plan.\nArticle 23—Governmental Regulations.\nThe Company's obligation to sell and deliver shares of Common Stock under the Plan is subject to the approval of any governmental authority required in\nconnection with the authorization, issuance or sale of such shares.\nGovernment regulations may impose reporting or other obligations on the Company with respect to the Plan. For example, the Company may be required\nto identify shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan on its stock ownership records and send tax information statements to employees and former employees\nwho transfer title to such shares.\nArticle 24—Rules Particular to Specific Jurisdictions.\nWithout limitation to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, the Committee may adopt such sub-plans or rules relating to the operation and\nadministration of the Plan to accommodate local laws, customs and procedures for jurisdictions outside of the United States, the terms of which may take\nprecedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of Article 4 hereof, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan or rules, the\nprovisions of this Plan will govern the operation of such sub-plan or rules. To the extent inconsistent with the requirements of Section 423, any such sub-plan or\nrules will be considered part of a Non-423 Offering, and Options granted thereunder will not be required by the terms of the Plan to comply with Section 423 of the\nCode. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee is authorized to adopt sub-plans or rules for particular non-U.S. jurisdictions that modify the\nterms of the Plan to meet applicable local requirements, customs or procedures regarding, without limitation, (i) eligibility to participate, (ii) the definition of\nCompensation, (iii) the dates and duration of Offering Periods or other periods during which participants may contribute payroll deductions towards the purchase of\nshares of Common Stock, (iv) the method of determining the Option Price and the discount from fair market value at which shares may be purchased, (v) any\nminimum or maximum amount of payroll deductions a participant may contribute in an Offering Period or other specified period under the applicable sub-plan or\nrules, (vi) the treatment of Options upon an Acquisition or adjustment event described in Article 12, (vii) the handling of payroll deductions and the methods for\ncontributing to the Plan by means other than payroll deductions, (viii) establishment of bank, building society or trust accounts to hold payroll deductions, (ix)\npayment of interest or waivers therefrom, (x) conversion of local currency, (xi) obligations to pay payroll tax, (xii)\n10\ndetermination of beneficiary designation requirements, (xiii) withholding procedures, and (xiv) handling of share issuances.\nArticle 25—Governing Law.\nThe validity and construction of the Plan shall be governed by the laws of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.\nArticle 26—Approval of Board of Directors and Stockholders of the Company and Subsequent Restatements.\nThe Plan was initially adopted by the Board of Directors on April 15, 2010, and was initially approved by the stockholders of the Company on July 16,\n2010. The Plan, as amended and restated, was adopted by the Committee on March 11, 2022. The Plan, as further amended and restated, was adopted by the Board\nof Directors on April 13, 2022, and was approved by the stockholders of the Company on June 9, 2022. Subsequent amendments and restatements were adopted by\nthe Committee on March 22, 2023, and July 31, 2024.\n11\nEXHIBIT 31.1\nCertification pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nI, Kevin T.
