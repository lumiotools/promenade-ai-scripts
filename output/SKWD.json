Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was $104.4 million, or $2.53 per diluted share, compared to $56.7 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, for the same 2023 period.\n\nAdjusted operating income(1) for the third quarter of 2024 was $29.4 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to $25.0 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the same 2023 period.

Our adjusted operating income was up nearly 18% over the prior year quarter, continuing the trend of strong earnings growth we have delivered every quarter as a public company, and our 19.1% annualized return on equity year to date is outstanding. We delivered gross written premiums growth of 12.4% over the prior year quarter while continuing to increase our mix of business to areas that are less exposed to the P&C cycles. Given investments into our business, the momentum building in certain divisions, and with full consideration for the market backdrop, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver strong growth as we look forward to the coming quarters.\"\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n_Underwriting Results_\n\n**Premiums**  \n---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **Three months ended September 30,**| **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n_unaudited_| **2024**|  2023| % Change| **2024**|  2023| % Change  \nGross written premiums| **$**| **400,014**|  $| 355,732| 12.4| %| **$**| **1,354,877**|  $| 1,138,224| 19.0| %  \nCeded written premiums| **$**| **(131,692**| **)**|  $| (75,036| )| 75.5| %| **$**| **(502,326**| **)**|  $| (441,650| )| 13.7| %  \nNet retention| **67.1**| **%**|  78.9| %| NM (1)| **62.9**| **%**|  61.2| %| NM (1)  \nNet written premiums| **$**| **268,322**|  $| 280,696| (4.4| )%| **$**| **852,551**|  $| 696,574| 22.4| %  \nNet earned premiums| **$**| **269,557**|  $| 227,033| 18.7| %| **$**| **763,482**|  $| 604,211| 26.4| %  \n_(1)__Not meaningful_  \n  \nThe increase in gross written premiums for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, when compared to the same 2023 periods, was driven by double-digit premium growth primarily from our transactional E&S, programs, captives, surety and global property & agriculture underwriting divisions.\n\nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the Company cancelled a quota share reinsurance contract.

The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily due to net income and an increase in the market value of our investment portfolio.\n\n**Share Repurchase Authorization**\n\nIn October 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of the Company's common stock.\n\nSkyward Specialty Chairman and CEO Andrew Robinson commented, “The share repurchase program allows Skyward to opportunistically deploy our capital in an accretive fashion and ultimately drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Given our strong cash position and financing flexibility, the repurchase program will not limit our ability to support our near-term growth or our flexibility to support ongoing investment in the key growth areas of our business, or to capture additional value creating opportunities.”\n\nThe shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases, accelerated share repurchase agreements or a combination of methods and pursuant to safe harbors provided by Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases under the share repurchase program will be determined by the Company in its discretion. The stock repurchase program does not require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAt 9:30 a.m. eastern time tomorrow, October 30, 2024, Skyward Specialty management will hold a conference call to discuss quarterly results with insurance industry analysts.

We refer to these measures as “non-GAAP financial measures.” We use these non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance.\n\nWe have chosen to exclude the net impact of the Loss Portfolio Transfer (“LPT”), all development on reserves fully or partially covered by the LPT and amortization of deferred gains associated with recoveries of prior LPT reserve strengthening in certain non-GAAP metrics, where noted, as the business subject to the LPT is not representative of our continuing business strategy. The business subject to the LPT is primarily related to policy years 2017 and prior, was generated and managed under prior leadership, and has either been exited or substantially repositioned during the reevaluation of our portfolio. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for our management and investors to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered supplemental in nature and is not meant to be a substitute for revenue or net income, in each case as recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. For more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of such measures to comparable GAAP financial measures, see the section entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\n**About Skyward Specialty Insurance Group, Inc.**\n\nSkyward Specialty is a rapidly growing and innovative specialty insurance company, delivering commercial property and casualty products and solutions on a non-admitted and admitted basis.

Given investments into our business, the momentum building in certain divisions, and with full consideration for the market backdrop, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver strong growth as we look forward to the coming quarters.\"\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n_Underwriting Results_\n\n**Premiums**  \n---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **Three months ended September 30,**| **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n_unaudited_| **2024**|  2023| % Change| **2024**|  2023| % Change  \nGross written premiums| **$**| **400,014**|  $| 355,732| 12.4| %| **$**| **1,354,877**|  $| 1,138,224| 19.0| %  \nCeded written premiums| **$**| **(131,692**| **)**|  $| (75,036| )| 75.5| %| **$**| **(502,326**| **)**|  $| (441,650| )| 13.7| %  \nNet retention| **67.1**| **%**|  78.9| %| NM (1)| **62.9**| **%**|  61.2| %| NM (1)  \nNet written premiums| **$**| **268,322**|  $| 280,696| (4.4| )%| **$**| **852,551**|  $| 696,574| 22.4| %  \nNet earned premiums| **$**| **269,557**|  $| 227,033| 18.7| %| **$**| **763,482**|  $| 604,211| 26.4| %  \n_(1)__Not meaningful_  \n  \nThe increase in gross written premiums for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, when compared to the same 2023 periods, was driven by double-digit premium growth primarily from our transactional E&S, programs, captives, surety and global property & agriculture underwriting divisions.\n\nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the Company cancelled a quota share reinsurance contract.

Given our strong cash position and financing flexibility, the repurchase program will not limit our ability to support our near-term growth or our flexibility to support ongoing investment in the key growth areas of our business, or to capture additional value creating opportunities.”\n\nThe shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases, accelerated share repurchase agreements or a combination of methods and pursuant to safe harbors provided by Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases under the share repurchase program will be determined by the Company in its discretion. The stock repurchase program does not require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAt 9:30 a.m. eastern time tomorrow, October 30, 2024, Skyward Specialty management will hold a conference call to discuss quarterly results with insurance industry analysts.

We refer to these measures as “non-GAAP financial measures.” We use these non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance.\n\nWe have chosen to exclude the net impact of the Loss Portfolio Transfer (“LPT”), all development on reserves fully or partially covered by the LPT and amortization of deferred gains associated with recoveries of prior LPT reserve strengthening in certain non-GAAP metrics, where noted, as the business subject to the LPT is not representative of our continuing business strategy. The business subject to the LPT is primarily related to policy years 2017 and prior, was generated and managed under prior leadership, and has either been exited or substantially repositioned during the reevaluation of our portfolio. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for our management and investors to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered supplemental in nature and is not meant to be a substitute for revenue or net income, in each case as recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. For more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of such measures to comparable GAAP financial measures, see the section entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\n**About Skyward Specialty Insurance Group, Inc.**\n\nSkyward Specialty is a rapidly growing and innovative specialty insurance company, delivering commercial property and casualty products and solutions on a non-admitted and admitted basis.
