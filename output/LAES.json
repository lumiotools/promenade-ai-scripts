November 8, 2024: SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) (\"SEALSQ\" or \"Company\"), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI, and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products, today announced that its secure digital identity ecosystem empowers and fortifies next-generation 5G networks against cyber-Threats, safeguards user privacy, and upholds data sovereignty. Furthermore, SEALSQ’s technology enables customers to achieve regulatory compliance and widespread trust and allows for a faster adoption of new technologies across all sectors, especially those that rely heavily on data integrity and operational trust.\n\nThe integrity of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems is vital for securing digital ecosystems with WebTrust Roots, particularly Root Certificate Authorities (Root CAs), forming the foundation of this hierarchy. Root CAs issue and verify digital certificates for subordinate Certification Authorities (CAs), and any compromise in a Root CA can endanger the entire trust chain, affecting all entities authenticated by its certificates. WISeKey’s trusted OISTE/WISeKey Root CA enhances PKI security, providing a robust foundation for issuing digital certificates and ensuring the legitimacy and security of digital identities.\n\nDigital certificates, issued by CAs under a Root CA’s oversight, authenticate the identities of websites, individuals and devices, and enable secure, trusted data transmission over the internet. For critical security needs, Extended Validation (EV) certificates offer additional verification, by providing a higher level of assurance regarding the entity behind a website. Many industries and governments mandate the use of digital certificates from WebTrust-compliant Root CAs, as they are embedded in major browsers and operating systems, ensuring universal trust across a wide range of platforms. WISeKey’s WebTrust compliance means that its Root CAs meet stringent regulatory standards, further enabling customers to achieve regulatory compliance and widespread trust.\n\n**Quantum Threats and the Need for Commercial and Industrial Cybersecurity Solutions**\n\nAs quantum computing progresses, it promises to solve complex problems at speeds previously unimaginable. This new capability unlocks vast commercial and industrial applications across sectors such as pharmaceuticals, where quantum computing could accelerate drug discovery, and logistics, where it could optimize supply chains for greater resilience. However, quantum computing also presents a significant security challenge. It has the potential to break traditional cryptographic protocols, jeopardizing the security of all digital communications and transactions.\n\nRecognizing these risks, SEALSQ and its parent company, WISeKey International Holding (“WISeKey”, SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), are pioneering quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions, preparing businesses for a future where quantum threats are real. From secure e-commerce platforms to digital banking, their advanced security infrastructure ensures that commercial and industrial applications remain safe from cyber-attacks and secure for customer transactions. The integration of WISeKey’s Root of Trust enables businesses to protect not only their customer data but also the integrity of critical operational processes within 5G networks.\n\n**Empowering Next-Generation 5G Industrial Applications**\n\nWith 5G’s rapid expansion integrating critical applications, from IoT to mission-critical operations, the need for robust cybersecurity has never been more pressing. This partnership provides essential infrastructure for industries looking to harness the full potential of 5G while protecting against cyber threats. Below are some examples of industrial sectors set to benefit from this collaboration:\n\n  1. **Manufacturing and Industrial Automation** Smart factories rely heavily on real-time data, interconnected machinery, and automated processes. WISeKey’s Root of Trust helps secure data transmitted between machines, ensuring production lines are safe from interference or cyber-attacks. The partnership’s robust PKI solutions make it possible to verify devices and secure communication flows, enabling seamless, secure production in Industry 4.0 environments.\n  2. **Automotive and Autonomous Transportation** Autonomous vehicles and connected cars depend on ultra-low-latency, secure 5G networks to communicate with each other, road infrastructure, and traffic systems. WISeKey’s digital identity solutions enhance trust in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, ensuring only authenticated devices can interact within the network. This significantly reduces the risk of malicious interference, which is critical for passenger safety and traffic flow management.\n  3. **Healthcare** In healthcare, data security is paramount for patient privacy and treatment efficacy.

SEALSQ’s [post-Quantum secure chips](https://www.sealsq.com/semiconductors/post-quantum-risc-v-chips), including the QVault TPM and QS7001 hardware platform, are designed to be resilient to attacks from quantum computers, ensuring long-term protection of critical data and communications. On the PKI side, SEALSQ is integrating post-quantum cryptographic algorithms into its RoT services, preparing businesses for the post-quantum era.\n\nSEALSQ’s CEO, Carlos Moreira commented, “By offering a fully integrated security stack that encompasses both definitions of RoT, SEALSQ provides one of the most complete and future-proof solutions on the market, widely distributed across billions of devices today. This unique combination positions SEALSQ as a leader in both current digital security needs and in the future post-quantum landscape.”\n\nJean Pierre Enguent, CTO from SEALSQ added, “We are proud to bring our security services to the next level in 2025 by providing unprecedented level of protection that includes quantum resistant hardware chips and post quantum cryptographic RoT. This forward-looking approach ensures that SEALSQ’s customers remain protected even as quantum computers become a reality, which could potentially break widely-used encryption algorithms such as RSA and ECC.”\n\n**About SEALSQ:**\n\nSEALSQ focuses on selling integrated solutions based on Semiconductors, PKI and Provisioning services, while developing Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products. Our solutions can be used in a variety of applications, from Multi-Factor Authentication tokens, Smart Energy, Smart Home Appliances, Medical and Healthcare and IT Network Infrastructure, to Automotive, Industrial Automation and Control Systems.\n\nPost-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) refers to cryptographic methods that are secure against an attack by a quantum computer.

Indeed, a recent breakthrough by researchers from Shanghai University demonstrated the power of quantum computing by efficiently cracking RSA encryption using a D-Wave quantum computer. (<https://t.ly/18g99>). This advancement underscores the urgency to develop new cryptographic defenses to protect sensitive information from being exposed.\n\nThis real-life example confirms Peter Shor’s theory that Quantum computers, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, have the potential to disrupt the very foundations of global data security by breaking widely used cryptographic algorithms, including RSA and AES. These encryption methods are essential for safeguarding sensitive information in web browsers, VPNs, email services, and chips from major brands. As the computational power of quantum machines increases, today’s encryption systems are becoming vulnerable to future attacks.\n\nIn response to the growing quantum threat, SEALSQ will not only offer to the market in 2025 a new generation of [Quantum Resistant chips](https://www.sealsq.com/semiconductors/post-quantum-risc-v-chips) but also integrate WISeKey’s latest advancements in Post-Quantum Encryption in its PKI as-a-service platform ([INeS](https://www.sealsq.com/managed-pki-for-iot/ines-managed-pki-for-iot)).\n\nThis combination of Quantum Resistant hardware and cryptography is unique on the security market as it offers a complete and integrated approach to the imminent threat posed by Quantum computers, ensuring that their computational power cannot undermine the privacy and integrity of global communication systems.\n\nSEALSQ’s upcoming webinar will focus on this topic – interested parties can join via <https://t.ly/caWn->\n\n**SEALSQ’s Post Quantum chips: A Game-Changer in Post-Quantum Cybersecurity**\n\nThe QS7001 is a cutting-edge RISC-V secure hardware platform specifically designed for IoT security and incorporating NIST’s recommended quantum-resistant algorithms, Kyber and Dilithium, to ensure robust protection against quantum-enabled breaches.\n\nThe QVault TPM is a Quantum Resistant Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) compliant with NIST FIPS 140-3 requirements and powered by the QS7001 hardware platform.\n\nVideo demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAWn24sXERg>\n\n“These chips represent a transformative leap in cybersecurity,” said Jean Pierre Enguent, CTO at SEALSQ. “As quantum computing capabilities advance, the vulnerabilities of current encryption methods become increasingly apparent. With our QS7001 and QVault TPM, we are set to provide industries and governments with the tools they need to safeguard their data and devices against the looming quantum threat.”\n\n**SEALSQ’s PKI will integrate WISeKey’s advancements in Post Quantum Encryption**\n\nWISeKey (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), SEALSQ’s parent company, is developing a new range of Trust Services, that will take advantage of the latest developments in post-quantum encryption (PQE) to be applied in real-world applications of digital signatures and encryption using PKI and digital certificates, such as secure communication channels (TLS), enhanced Key Exchanges and email security (S/MIME). These services are currently based in standards that can be improved to be resilient to quantum attacks and offer backwards compatibility with existing counterparts. WISeKey implementation of PQE is done around the concept of “hybrid signatures” which combine in a single X.509 certificate a conventional signature with a second signature using a PQE algorithm. This approach ensures backwards compatibility and opens a new horizon of cybersecurity services.\n\nLater this year, WISeKey plans to offer a first “Root of Trust” based in PQE algorithms promoted currently by the NIST as valid candidates, which will be the foundation of a new portfolio of Trust Services and secure several IoT projects on which WISeKey is already working.\n\nPreviously WISeKey provided updates on its progress in developing post-quantum resistant algorithms by establishing strategic R&D partnerships with MINES Saint-Etienne Research Institute. WISeKey’s R&D group has been working with several NIST’s candidates for the MS600X Common Criteria products, such as Crystals-Kyber and Crystals-Dilithium, aiming to develop a complete post-quantum cryptography toolbox to be combined with new PKI-related Trust Services delivered by WISeKey.\n\nBy investing in post-quantum semiconductors and cryptography, SEALSQ and WISeKey position themselves at the forefront of cybersecurity, providing essential protection for the next generation of digital systems against the unprecedented risks posed by quantum computing.\n\n**About SEALSQ:**\n\nSEALSQ focuses on selling integrated solutions based on Semiconductors, PKI and Provisioning services, while developing Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products.

As quantum-computing brings a paradigm shift in computational power by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, the need for enhanced security has never been greater.\n\nTo address these emerging challenges, the SEALSQ team — led by Nascimo Madieta, Guillaume Aymard, and Daniele Fronte — recently published their research titled _“Memory Efficient Implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber,”_ developed in collaboration with Mines Saint-Etienne, a leading French university (see details[here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sBcDa-HAg58FnidUCOyzHxfxUk6ofHvOo_DVZr7LhjxWB6IPG4r0LxsP4sUSJ01qMxRt8jIXDc-G_CzkZBgSSCruaHueVrFsO8yCZUg1IYk8Z6VCgv0qDsfYeOaqgoPRxivE9Xk8yeb3_0b3PqjH5g== \"here\")). This breakthrough paper introduces a memory-efficient software implementation of the Quantum-Resistant Algorithm CRYSTALS-Kyber, optimized for standard microcontrollers and embedded devices.\n\nThe implementation not only integrates seamlessly across various platforms but also reduces the memory footprint of CRYSTALS-Kyber execution to just 3KB, while maintaining exceptional performance. The approach consolidates all Kyber variants (Kyber-512, Kyber-768, Kyber-1024) into a unified codebase, aligning with NIST’s FIPS-203 directive, and opens up new possibilities for enhancing implementation speed.\n\nSEALSQ's commitment to developing post-quantum cryptographic solutions ensures that industries remain protected as we approach the quantum era. Our innovations provide a critical defense against the quantum threat, securing everything from financial transactions and personal data to sensitive business communications.\n\n\"We are proud to contribute to the advancement of post-quantum cryptography and lead the way in bringing quantum-resistant algorithms to secure semiconductor applications,\" said Carlos Moreira, CEO of SEALSQ. \"Thanks to the commitment and expertise of our team, SEALSQ continues to develop the tools necessary for securing the digital world in the quantum-computing era.\"\n\nQuantum-computing’s unique approach, grounded in the principles of quantum physics, promises to unlock unprecedented computational capabilities. This technology is set to revolutionize industries, from drug research, energy management, and cybersecurity to artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle navigation, and financial modeling. As the quantum-computing market is expected to reach $50 billion by the end of this decade, it is clear that organizations must act now to limit their exposure to future threats.\n\nGlobal technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Google, and Microsoft have already launched commercial quantum-computing cloud services, underscoring the rapid advancements in this field. However, quantum-computing also introduces risks. Quantum-computers have the potential to break current encryption methods with alarming speed, rendering traditional security tools ineffective. “Harvest-now, decrypt-later” attacks are a growing concern, where adversaries may steal encrypted data today, waiting for future quantum technology to decrypt it.\n\n**About SEALSQ:** SEALSQ focuses on selling integrated solutions based on Semiconductors, PKI and Provisioning services, while developing Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products. Our solutions can be used in a variety of applications, from Multi-Factor Authentication tokens, Smart Energy, Smart Home Appliances, Medical and Healthcare and IT Network Infrastructure, to Automotive, Industrial Automation and Control Systems.\n\nPost-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) refers to cryptographic methods that are secure against an attack by a quantum computer. As quantum computers become more powerful, they may be able to break many of the cryptographic methods that are currently used to protect sensitive information, such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). PQC aims to develop new cryptographic methods that are secure against quantum attacks.
