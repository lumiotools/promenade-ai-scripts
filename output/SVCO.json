The financial information below represents forward-looking financial information and in some instances forward-looking, non-GAAP financial information, including estimates of non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating income. GAAP gross margin is the most comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP gross margin, and GAAP operating income is the most comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating income differs from GAAP operating income in that it excludes items such as certain transaction-related costs, IPO preparation costs, estimated acquisition-related litigation claims and costs, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges and executive severance costs. Silvaco is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Silvaco has not provided guidance for GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating income or a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin or non-GAAP operating income guidance to GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating income, respectively. However, it is important to note that these excluded items could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP in future periods.\n\nBased on current business trends and conditions, the Company expects for fourth quarter 2024 the following:\n\n  * Gross bookings in the range of $18.5 million to $21.5 million, which would represent a 19% to 38% increase from the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Revenue in the range of $18.1 million to $21.2 million, which would represent a 45% to 70% increase from the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 85% to 87%, increased from 79% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Non-GAAP operating income in the range of $2.6 million to $5.6 million, increased from the loss of $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nFor full year 2024, the Company expects:\n\n  * Gross bookings of $64.0 million to $67.0 million, which would represent a 10% to 15% increase from 2023.\n\n\n  * Revenue of $60.0 million to $63.0 million, which would represent a 11% to 16% increase from 2023.\n\n\n  * Non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 85% to 87%, increased from 83% in 2023.\n\n\n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $5.0 million to $8.0 million, which would represent a 14% to 82% increase from 2023.\n\n\n\n**Q3 2024 Conference Call Details**\n\nA press release highlighting the Company’s results along with supplemental financial results will be available at https://investors.silvaco.com/ along with an earnings presentation to accompany management’s prepared remarks on the day of the conference call, after market close.

These documents are available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations section of Silvaco’s website at [_http://investors.silvaco.com/_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=X2KqxadZp0X0qs8LN40csTaZnW1d64sH91nUqfKi3_1yGiUl2P_9h9tkGBEbld52x8lTbCng-p21Rvv4iAVqZFI0DrpUss6g2xz4tFfK611HY64dosNeVyL4iFkm0nuc). These forward-looking statements represent Silvaco’s expectations as of the date of this press release. Subsequent events may cause these expectations to change, and Silvaco disclaims any obligations to update or alter these forward-looking statements in the future, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the performance measures in our consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons.\n\nWe define non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as our GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin adjusted to exclude certain costs, including stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We define non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin as our GAAP operating expenses, GAAP operating income (loss), and GAAP operating margin, in each case, adjusted to exclude certain costs, including certain transaction-related costs, IPO preparation costs, estimated acquisition-related litigation claims and costs, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, and executive severance costs. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as our GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude certain costs, including certain transaction-related costs, IPO preparation costs, estimated acquisition-related litigation claims and costs, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, executive severance costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration, foreign exchange (gain) loss, loss on extinguishment of debt, and the income tax effect on non-GAAP items. Our non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is calculated in the same way as our non-GAAP net income (loss), but on a per share basis. We monitor non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the financial information we present in accordance with GAAP to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results.\n\nCertain items are excluded from our non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share because these items are non-cash in nature or are not indicative of our core operating performance and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We adjust GAAP gross profit, GAAP gross margin, GAAP operating expenses, GAAP operating income (loss), GAAP operating margin, and net income (loss) for these items to arrive at non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income (loss) because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze our financial performance and the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n**SILVACO GROUP, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n(Unaudited, in thousands except share and par value amounts)  \n**September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nASSETS  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 26,606| $| 4,421  \nShort-term marketable securities| 73,782| -

Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These statements are based on the Company’s current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those described in the Company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\n**Media Contact** Tyler Weilandpress@silvaco.com\n\n**Investor Relations:** Greg McNiffinvestors@silvaco.com\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MjcyMzJlMzAtZjEyNS00NzExLTg2ZjktNzAxYjRlYmY5ZDUwLTEwOTI0MjI=/tiny/Silvaco.png)\n"

(Nasdaq: SVCO) (“Silvaco” or the “Company”), a provider of TCAD, EDA software, and SIP solutions that enable semiconductor design and digital twin modeling through AI software and innovation, today announced preliminary unaudited revenue results for the third quarter 2024 and updated its outlook for the full year 2024. The Company will report its full third quarter 2024 earnings results and hold a conference call with an earnings presentation on November 12, 2024.\n\n“Similar to trends observed across the semiconductor industry, we saw a decline in orders from Asia during Q3 primarily driven by economic challenges and the ongoing strain in U.S.-China trade relations. Accordingly, we are adjusting our expectations for the remainder of the year,\" said Babak Taheri, Silvaco’s Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Taheri continued, “We remain confident in our long-term strategy and continue to believe we will be able to achieve double-digit long-term revenue growth driven by our proprietary platform and solutions, examples of which are described in our recent press release of September 24, 2024, alongside our ability to effectively capitalize on strategic acquisition opportunities.”\n\nPreliminarily, the Company expects total unaudited revenues for the third quarter 2024 to be approximately $11.0 million, not including a large order of approximately $5.0 million, which was expected in the third quarter of 2024, but was received in the first week of the fourth quarter of 2024. This order is included in our full-year guidance for bookings below and is expected to contribute to the Company’s fourth quarter of 2024 revenue. Preliminary results are unaudited, subject to completion of the Company’s financial reporting process, based on information known by management as of the date of this press release, and do not represent a comprehensive statement of our financial results for the third quarter 2024.\n\nIn addition, based on current business trends and conditions, the Company is updating its expectations regarding the full year 2024, as follows:\n\nPrevious Full Year 2024 Guidance| Updated Full Year 2024 Guidance  \n---|---  \nGross bookings| $67 million to $71 million| $64 million to $67 million  \nRevenue| $63 million to $66 million| $60 million to $63 million  \nyear-over-year growth| 16% to 22%| 10% to 16%  \nNon-GAAP gross margin| 85% to 89%| 85% to 87%  \nNon-GAAP operating income| $8.0 million to $11.0 million| $5.0 million to $8.0 million  \n  \nThis updated guidance represents Silvaco’s current estimates of its operations and financial results as of October 15, 2024. The financial information above represents forward-looking financial information and in some instances forward-looking, non-GAAP financial information, including estimates of non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating income. GAAP gross margin is the most comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP gross margin, and GAAP operating income is the most comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating income differs from GAAP operating income in that it excludes items such as certain transaction-related costs, IPO preparation costs, estimated acquisition-related litigation claims and costs, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges and executive severance costs. Silvaco is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Silvaco has not provided guidance for GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating income or a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin or non-GAAP operating income guidance to GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating income, respectively. However, it is important to note that these excluded items could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP in future periods.\n\n**Q3 2024 Conference Call Details**\n\nA press release highlighting the Company's results along with supplemental financial results will be available at https://investors.silvaco.com/ along with an earnings presentation to accompany management’s prepared remarks on the day of the conference call, after market close. An archived replay of the conference call will be available on this website for a limited time after the call.

These documents are available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations section of Silvaco's website at [_http://investors.silvaco.com/._](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uuxjrRXeY9KgHNvj7cb7o3D0GCMsTJyuajd7-ZPNMWtrNr8Np0m8Q1KQNvmF8L59tya8zOm2cnKPUptkhcOp9F_Onl5rIBMwoZaSwRLKyJLRei3uGSNhCH_dqs9xQaBX) These forward-looking statements represent Silvaco's expectations as of the date of this press release. Subsequent events may cause these expectations to change, and Silvaco disclaims any obligations to update or alter these forward-looking statements in the future, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the performance measures in our consolidated financial statements which are presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP operating income (loss). We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons.\n\nWe define non-GAAP gross margin as our GAAP gross margin adjusted to exclude certain costs, including stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as our GAAP operating income (loss) adjusted to exclude certain costs, including certain transaction-related costs, IPO preparation costs, estimated acquisition-related litigation claims and costs, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, and executive severance costs. We monitor non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating income (loss) as non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the financial information we present in accordance with GAAP to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results.\n\nCertain of the items excluded from our non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating income (loss) are non-cash in nature or are not indicative of our core operating performance and render comparisons with prior periods and our competitors less meaningful. We adjust GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating income (loss) for these items to arrive at non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating income (loss) because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating income (loss) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze our financial performance and the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n**Investor Contact:** Greg McNiffinvestors@silvaco.com\n\n**Media Contact:** Tyler Weilandpress@silvaco.com\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NjczYTdmM2ItZDVmYS00YjQzLThkYmYtNDMxYzQyNmUxYzhkLTEwOTI0MjI=/tiny/Silvaco.png)\n"
