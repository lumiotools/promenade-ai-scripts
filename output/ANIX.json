After the required one-month waiting period to assess the occurrence of dose limiting toxicity and review of all safety data, the trial has now dosed its first patient in the third cohort at a tenfold increase over the initial dose.</p> <p>Anixa's FSHR-mediated CAR-T technology targets the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), which research indicates is exclusively expressed on ovarian cells, tumor vasculature, and certain cancer cells. The first-in-human trial (<a href=\"https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05316129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NCT05316129</a>) is enrolling adult women with recurrent ovarian cancer who have progressed on at least two prior therapies. The study is designed to evaluate safety and identify the maximum tolerated dose, while monitoring efficacy.</p> <p>Dr. Robert Wenham, principal investigator of the study and Chair of the Department of Gynecologic Oncology at Moffitt, stated, \"With no dose-limiting safety issues observed in the first and second patient cohorts, we have advanced to the next cohort to evaluate a 10x higher dose compared with the starting dose. As the trial continues, our aim is to demonstrate the tolerability of our CAR-T but we are optimistic and hopeful about seeing efficacy in this solid tumor—a challenging area for traditional CAR-T therapies, which have shown efficacy mainly in hematologic tumors and lymphomas. We are very encouraged how the trial has progressed and our observation in one patient from the first cohort who had relative stability and even some mild improvement for well over a year after her infusion. This is highly unusual for a platinum resistant multiply treated ovarian cancer. A tumor biopsy showed necrosis and T cell infiltration. Based on these findings, we recently submitted an amendment to the trial protocol to allow patients who may benefit from an additional dose. Generally, we expect higher cell doses to increase efficacy, although we also anticipate a second dose may further improve response rates and durability. We are proud of the progress to date and look forward to treating additional patients in the third cohort.\"</p> <p><b>About Anixa Biosciences, Inc. <br></b>Anixa is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer.

(\"Anixa\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ANIX), a biotechnology company focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer, today announced a presentation of new, updated positive data from the Phase 1 clinical trial of its breast cancer vaccine (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04674306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NCT04674306</a>) at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 39th Annual Meeting, being held in Houston, Texas. The trial is being conducted in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic with funding by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense. The presentation, titled \"Phase I Trial of alpha-lactalbumin vaccine in high-risk operable triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and patients at high genetic risk for TNBC,\" was presented by Dr. Emily Rhoades, FDA/IND Trial Program Manager at Cleveland Clinic. </p> <div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"> <p> <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/602982/ITUS_Corporation_Logo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/602982/ITUS_Corporation_Logo.jpg\" title=\"Anixa Biosciences, Inc. (PRNewsfoto/Anixa Biosciences, Inc.)\" alt=\"Anixa Biosciences, Inc. (PRNewsfoto/Anixa Biosciences, Inc.)\"> </a> </p> </div> <p>\"Triple negative breast cancer is the form of the disease for which we have the least effective treatments,\" said G. Thomas Budd, M.D. of Cleveland Clinic's Cancer Institute and principal investigator of the Phase 1 study. \"Long term, we are hoping that this can be a true preventive vaccine that would be administered to individuals who are cancer-free to prevent them from developing this highly aggressive disease.\"</p> <p>\"We are pleased with the data we have observed in this clinical trial. The data continues to exceed our expectations. As we near completion of the Phase 1 trial, with the very positive data to date, we are planning a Phase 2 study which is expected to commence in 2025,\" stated Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO of Anixa Biosciences. \"We want to thank all of the participants in this trial and also the extensive group of scientists and physicians (19 are listed as co-authors of the SITC presentation) who have worked on this study, along with the numerous additional personnel including nurses, pharmacists, phlebotomists and others who have provided support.\" </p> <p>The investigational vaccine is based on decades of groundbreaking pre-clinical research led by the late Vincent Tuohy, Ph.D., who was the Mort and Iris November Distinguished Chair in Innovative Breast Cancer Research at Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute. Dr. Tuohy's research led to the development of this investigational vaccine. The study is based on Dr. Tuohy's research that showed that activating the immune system against α-lactalbumin was safe and effective in preventing breast tumors in mice. The research, originally published in <i><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.2161\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nature Medicine</a></i>, was funded in part by philanthropic gifts to Cleveland Clinic from more than 20,000 people over the last 12 years.</p> <p>The vaccine was developed at Cleveland Clinic and licensed to Anixa Biosciences. Cleveland Clinic is entitled to royalties and other commercialization revenues from the Company.</p> <p>\"It was Dr. Tuohy's hope that this vaccine would demonstrate the potential of immunization as a new way to control breast cancer, and that a similar approach could someday be applied to other types of malignancy,\" said Dr. Budd.</p> <p><b>Description of the Breast Cancer Vaccine</b><br>The vaccine targets a lactation protein, α-lactalbumin, which is only expressed in the breast when a woman is lactating but not at other times in her life or in other tissues. However, when a woman develops breast cancer, including TNBC or other types of breast cancer, many of the malignant cells will express α-lactalbumin. Activating the immune system, through vaccination, to direct cytotoxic T cells to the tumor cell expressing this protein may provide preemptive immune protection against emerging breast tumors that express α-lactalbumin.</p> <p>Initial Phase 1 data was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2023. The synopsis below summarizes the additional findings which were presented today at the SITC 39th Annual Meeting. </p> <p><b>Presentation Summary</b><br>The trial is recruiting patients into three cohorts. Below is a description of each cohort as well as a summary of the key results and conclusions to date.</p> <p><b>Cohort 1a participants:</b> The patients enrolled are women who, within the previous three years, have completed standard of care (SOC) treatment, including surgery, for TNBC, the most lethal type of breast cancer. The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of the vaccine, characterizing immune responses, and identifying a maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</p> <p><b>Key Results:</b> All three goals noted above have been achieved, in a group of 21 patients in this cohort. While the MTD has been successfully identified, additional dosages are being evaluated to confirm the MTD. In all patients at the current MTD, the vaccine was safe, producing no flu-like symptoms such as fever and myalgias, no abnormal clinical laboratory tests, or other observed adverse side effects. The only notable side effect was injection site irritation. The majority of patients exhibited protocol defined immune responses of α-lactalbumin specific T cell induced interferon gamma and interleukin-17. </p> <p><b>Cohort 1b participants:</b> The patients enrolled are women who carry mutations in their BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 genes that place them at high risk of developing breast cancer, which is frequently TNBC. These women have chosen to have prophylactic mastectomies to reduce their risk of breast cancer. These participants were vaccinated prior to their surgeries, after which they were monitored for safety and immune responses. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis will be performed on their resected breast tissue to evaluate their healthy breast tissue to determine if there are micro-foci of lactational cells, inflammation in the area of those foci and the presence of micro-tumors.</p> <p><b>Key Results:</b> Three women have been enrolled in this cohort to date. The safety and tolerability of the vaccine were similar to that in Cohort 1a. Enrollment of additional patients in this cohort is ongoing. The IHC analysis is ongoing and will be presented in a future scientific presentation.</p> <p><b>Cohort 1c participants: </b>The patients enrolled in this group are women diagnosed with TNBC who have completed SOC, including surgery, and are receiving pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in the adjuvant, post-surgery setting. Since Keytruda, a checkpoint inhibitor, is already a powerful immunotherapy with its own side effect profile, one of the primary goals of this cohort is to evaluate whether the administration of the vaccine in combination with Keytruda causes intolerable side effects. Immune responses are also being monitored in these participants.</p> <p><b>Key Results: </b>Three women have been enrolled in this cohort to date. Most notably, there were no major adverse side effects when the combination of vaccine and Keytruda were administered. As with the patients in cohorts 1a and 1b, the primary adverse side effect was injection site irritation. One patient exhibited a Grade 3 adverse event, which was a greater amount of irritation at one injection site. This patient had been diagnosed with breast cancer while she was pregnant, and she had recently lactated when the vaccine was administered. The trial protocol is being amended to provide for a six-month delay after lactation before a patient can be vaccinated. Similar to the patients enrolled in cohort 1a, the participants in this trial also exhibited antigen-specific T cell immune responses as hoped. Now that antigen-specific T cell responses have been confirmed in women receiving Keytruda and the vaccine, with no major side effects, the data provide the confidence to plan a Phase 2 study in the neoadjuvant setting with newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.</p> <p>\"Since the trial results to date have been very positive, the planned Phase 2 trial will enroll newly diagnosed breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment. Patients will be randomized in a one-to-one ratio, to receive either the standard of care, as defined by NCCN guidelines, alone or the vaccine plus standard of care. The important endpoints in this study will include characterization of T and B cell immune responses and repertoires, pathologic complete response and safety. Utilizing the vaccine in this type of setting will enable us to determine the effect within months for individual patients. The presence of a control group will allow us to determine efficacy in this setting. Assuming the trial data continues to be positive, such a trial may enable a quicker route to a strategic relationship with a large pharmaceutical partner for commercialization,\" stated Dr. Kumar.</p> <p>The poster presented at SITC can be viewed at <a href=\"https://ir.anixa.com/events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ir.anixa.com/events</a>.</p> <p>For more information and eligibility requirements visit <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04674306\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">clinicaltrials.gov</a>.</p> <p><b>About Anixa Biosciences, Inc. </b><br>Anixa is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer.

One such protein is a breast-specific lactation protein, α-lactalbumin, which is no longer found post-lactation in normal, aging tissues, but is present in certain breast cancers. Activating the immune system against this \"retired\" protein provides preemptive immune protection against emerging breast tumors that express α-lactalbumin. The vaccine also contains an adjuvant that activates an innate immune response, which allows the immune system to mount a response against emerging tumors to prevent them from growing.</p> <p>Initial Phase 1 data was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2023. The data showed no safety concerns, with protocol defined immune responses observed in a majority of patients.</p> <p>The Phase 1 trial is conducted in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic and is funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense. Anixa is the exclusive worldwide licensee of the novel breast cancer vaccine technology developed at Cleveland Clinic. The grant funding from the U.S. Department of Defense was provided to Cleveland Clinic.</p> <p>This vaccine technology was invented by the late Dr. Vincent Tuohy, who was the Mort and Iris November Distinguished Chair in Innovative Breast Cancer Research in the Department of Inflammation and Immunity at Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute.

This strategy not only offers a faster route to regulatory success but also ensures a more cost-effective approach, maximizing the impact of our resources. With Suyasha's leadership and expertise, we are confident that we will bring this promising therapy to patients more efficiently and effectively,\" concluded Dr. Garzone.</p> <p><b>About Anixa Bioscience's Breast Cancer Vaccine</b></p> <p>Anixa's breast cancer vaccine takes advantage of endogenously produced proteins that have a function at certain times in life, but then become \"retired\" and disappear from the body. One such protein is a breast-specific lactation protein, α-lactalbumin, which is no longer found post-lactation in normal, aging tissues, but is present in certain breast cancers. Activating the immune system against this \"retired\" protein provides preemptive immune protection against emerging breast tumors that express α-lactalbumin. The vaccine also contains an adjuvant that activates an innate immune response, which allows the immune system to mount a response against emerging tumors to prevent them from growing.</p> <p>Initial Phase 1 data was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2023. The data showed no safety concerns, with protocol defined immune responses observed in a majority of patients. Additional data from the Phase 1 trial will be presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting in early November 2024.</p> <p>The Phase 1 trial is conducted in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic and is funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense. Anixa is the exclusive worldwide licensee of the novel breast cancer vaccine technology developed at Cleveland Clinic. The grant funding from the U.S. Department of Defense was provided to Cleveland Clinic.</p> <p>This vaccine technology was invented by the late Dr. Vincent Tuohy, who was the Mort and Iris November Distinguished Chair in Innovative Breast Cancer Research in the Department of Inflammation and Immunity at Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute. Cleveland Clinic exclusively licensed this technology to Anixa Biosciences. Dr. Tuohy was entitled to a portion of the commercialization revenues received by Cleveland Clinic and also held equity in Anixa.</p> <p><b>About Anixa Biosciences, Inc. </b></p> <p>Anixa is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer. Anixa's therapeutic portfolio consists of an ovarian cancer immunotherapy program being developed in collaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center, which uses a novel type of CAR-T, known as chimeric endocrine receptor-T cell (CER-T) technology. The Company's vaccine portfolio includes vaccines being developed in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic to prevent breast cancer – specifically triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most lethal form of the disease – and ovarian cancer, as well as additional cancer vaccines to address many intractable cancers, including high incidence malignancies in lung, colon, and prostate. These vaccine technologies focus on immunizing against \"retired\" proteins that have been found to be expressed in certain forms of cancer.

(PRNewsfoto/Anixa Biosciences, Inc.)\"> </a> </p> </div> <p>A key change in the protocol provides a second dose of the therapy to patients who might benefit from an additional dose. Previously, Anixa and Moffitt sought and received approval of a single patient IND application to enable a second dose for a single patient who, upon examination of tumor obtained from a biopsy, exhibited cellular infiltration and necrosis, indicating biologic activity of the CAR-T. This amendment will permit all potential patients to receive another leukapheresis and a second dose of CAR-T, without submitting individual INDs for each patient.</p> <p>Dr. Robert Wenham, Chair of the Gynecologic Oncology Department at Moffitt, and the principal investigator of the trial, stated, \"In initial Phase 1 clinical trials, it is customary to begin with low, often subtherapeutic cell doses to verify safety, before increasing the dose levels. In our study, the patient approved for a second dose by the individual IND received the starting, lowest dose. While initially meeting the criteria for progression due to size of her predominate tumor, her cancer has since remained relatively stable and she has not received additional therapy since her first infusion. We are hoping a second, higher dose may improve her overall response and outcome. In general, we anticipate that higher cell doses will lead to efficacy, but for solid tumors, a second dose may be needed in a subset of patients to improve the rate and durability of responses.\" </p> <p>\"We hope to get approval from regulatory agencies shortly, to enable second doses for the appropriate patients. We are clearly enthusiastic about the progress of this trial and are looking forward to treating additional patients,\" stated Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO of Anixa Biosciences. </p> <p><b>About Anixa Biosciences, Inc. </b></p> <p>Anixa is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer.

(PRNewsfoto/Anixa Biosciences, Inc.)\"> </a> </p> </div> <p>The proposed Phase 2 trial will evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine administered in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) setting, in combination with chemotherapy and Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The goal of neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce tumor burden and to prevent tumor recurrence with the intent to improve survival. This clinical trial approach allows Anixa to enroll a broader range of patients, encompassing multiple types of breast cancer. The therapeutic market for breast cancer is large due to the increase in prevalence of breast cancer and an increase in screening resulting in a demand for treatment. Compared with primary prevention, the development path for breast cancer treatment is expected to have a shorter path to approval. The therapeutic market covers all stages of breast cancer, from early to advanced and metastatic cases. In 2023, the market was valued at approximately $38.35 billion and is projected to reach $89.67 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.9% (Maximize Market Research).</p> <p>The key objectives of the trial include evaluating the immunological response to the vaccine and comparing clinical efficacy of standard of care therapy alone with the vaccine plus standard of care therapy. A key component of this trial will be the evaluation of breast cancer tissue and the validation of the immunological mechanism of action of the vaccine.</p> <p>The trial is expected to commence in 2025 and is projected to last approximately two to three years. Immunological responses to the vaccine will be made available as the trial advances, providing a faster and more cost-effective path toward potential approval and/or partnerships with pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>\"We are excited to unveil our Phase 2 study plan, bringing us one step closer to a potentially transformative therapy for breast cancer patients,\" said Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO of Anixa Biosciences. \"By targeting treatment rather than prevention, we can reach a broader patient population and potentially expedite the process of regulatory approval and partnerships. This trial marks a key milestone in advancing our mission to fight cancer through innovative therapies. While our Phase 2 trial focuses on the therapeutic market, with the data obtained in this trial, we expect to conduct additional, more informed studies for both recurrence prevention and primary prevention with partners in the future.\"</p> <p>Initial Phase 1 data was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2023.

FSHR is found at immunologically relevant levels exclusively on the granulosa cells of the ovaries. Since the target is a hormone (chimeric endocrine) receptor, and the target-binding domain is derived from its natural ligand, this technology is known as CER-T (chimeric endocrine receptor-T cell) therapy, a new type of CAR-T.

One such protein is a breast-specific lactation protein, α-lactalbumin, which is no longer found post-lactation in normal, aging tissues, but is present in certain breast cancers. Activating the immune system against this \"retired\" protein provides preemptive immune protection against emerging breast tumors that express α-lactalbumin. The vaccine also contains an adjuvant that activates an innate immune response, which allows the immune system to mount a response against emerging tumors to prevent them from growing.</p> <p>This vaccine technology was invented by the late Dr. Vincent Tuohy, who was the Mort and Iris November Distinguished Chair in Innovative Breast Cancer Research in the Department of Inflammation and Immunity at Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute. Cleveland Clinic exclusively licensed this technology to Anixa Biosciences. Dr. Tuohy was entitled to a portion of the commercialization revenues received by Cleveland Clinic and also held equity in Anixa.</p> <p><b>About Anixa Biosciences, Inc. <br></b>Anixa is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer.

(PRNewsfoto/Anixa Biosciences, Inc.)\"> </a> </p> </div> <p>Anixa's FSHR-mediated CAR-T technology, also known as chimeric endocrine receptor T-cell (CER-T), differs from traditional CAR-T therapy by targeting the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), which research indicates is exclusively expressed on ovarian cells, including the vasculature of tumors. The first-in-human trial (<a href=\"https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05316129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NCT05316129</a>) is enrolling female adult patients with recurrent/progressing ovarian cancer who have progressed on at least two prior therapies. The study is designed to evaluate safety and identify the maximum tolerated dose, while monitoring efficacy.</p> <p>Safety was previously confirmed in the first three-patient cohort. The fourth through sixth patients, enrolled in the second cohort of the Phase 1 clinical trial, received triple the dose of CAR-T cells compared with the dose of the first cohort, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed.</p> <p>Following the requisite wait time, of one month after dosing, enabling confirmation that it is safe to escalate, the trial will immediately begin enrolling patients in the third dose cohort, which will be at a ten times higher dose than the initial dosage.</p> <p>Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO of Anixa Biosciences, stated, \"We are highly encouraged by the favorable safety profile observed thus far in both the first and second patient cohorts, and are eager to evaluate a higher dose in the next cohort. We are particularly encouraged by a notable response in one of the patients in the first cohort, even though the dosage was considered a subtherapeutic level. Our aim is to maintain a positive safety profile as we escalate dosing, with the goal of demonstrating additional objective evidence of efficacy. Unlike conventional CAR-T cell therapies, which have achieved amazing results in various hematological cancers, they have not been effective in solid tumors. In contrast, we believe Anixa's novel technology has the potential to make CAR-T effective in ovarian cancer and perhaps across multiple solid tumor types. Our unique and highly targeted CER-T approach targets the FSHR, which is exclusively expressed on ovarian cells. A potential dual mechanism of action is operating with our therapy targeting tumor vasculature by starving or shrinking the tumor from the inside out, as well as direct targeting of ovarian cells.\"</p> <p>Dr. Kumar continued, \"We believe that intraperitoneal (IP) delivery may also be a significant advantage of our therapy, as it allows direct trafficking of the CAR-T cells to the tumor sites, which helps to minimize side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We believe this method of delivery not only enhances the targeting of the tumor but also improves the overall safety profile of the treatment. We expect that IP delivery may enable us to use dosages that are much higher than possible with intravenous delivery.\"</p> <p><b>About Anixa Biosciences, Inc. <br></b></p> <p>Anixa is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer.

Cleveland Clinic is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial targeting triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive and lethal form of breast cancer, and an ovarian cancer vaccine is in pre-clinical development in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute.</p> <div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1\"> <p> <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/602982/ITUS_Corporation_Logo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/602982/ITUS_Corporation_Logo.jpg\" title=\"Anixa Biosciences, Inc.

(PRNewsfoto/Anixa Biosciences, Inc.)\"> </a> </p> </div> <p>The vaccines focus on a novel scientific mechanism never used before in a cancer vaccine. By developing vaccines that immunize against \"retired\" proteins found to be expressed in specific forms of cancer, the researchers are investigating if certain cancer cells can be destroyed as they arise, and ultimately prevent tumors from forming. The vaccines were developed at Cleveland Clinic and licensed to Anixa Biosciences. Cleveland Clinic is entitled to royalties and other commercialization revenues from the Company.</p> <p>The research under this new JDA will be led at Cleveland Clinic by Thaddeus Stappenbeck, MD, PhD, Department Chair of Inflammation and Immunity, and will include Justin Johnson, PhD, one of the co-inventors of the breast and ovarian cancer vaccines along with the late Vincent Tuohy, PhD.</p> <p>Anixa Chairman and CEO Dr. Amit Kumar stated, \"Cleveland Clinic is a valued partner to Anixa in the development of both breast and ovarian cancer vaccines. The progress we've made to date in the breast cancer vaccine program, including promising <a href=\"https://ir.anixa.com/press-releases/detail/1030/anixa-biosciences-and-cleveland-clinic-present-positive-new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">preliminary data</a>, drives our confidence in pursuing research and development for additional vaccines and cancer types using the same technology platform. Assuming the breast cancer clinical studies continue to exhibit positive results, we believe the search for 'retired' protein antigens will be pursued by many cancer researchers. We are seeking to maintain our lead in this potentially game-changing arena of cancer research.\"</p> <p>\"We look forward to expanding our relationship with Anixa in this endeavor,\" said Dr. Stappenbeck. \"As we begin the discovery effort to evaluate which cancer types will be best for targeting, we hope to address many intractable cancers, including high incidence malignancies in the lung, colon, and prostate.\"</p> <p><b>Company Presentation<br></b>Dr. Kumar will be presenting an overview of the Company, its clinical programs, and more information on the expansion of its cancer vaccine program with Cleveland Clinic at the Sidoti Micro-Cap Virtual Conference on May 9, 2024.
