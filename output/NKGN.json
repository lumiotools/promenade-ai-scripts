This suggests a potential role for the use of troculeucel in delaying or preventing dementia onset in asymptomatic individuals with detectable biomarkers._\n\n_Preliminary analysis from the Phase 1/2a AD trial administering_ _the highest dose of cryopreserved troculeucel given to date (6 billion cells) showed troculeucel to be very safe with no adverse reactions. Of the first three subjects treated at this highest dose, 100% had stable or improved cognitive function, and two of the three showed significant improvement from moderate stage disease to mild cognitive impairment after only three months of treatment._\n\nSANTA ANA, Calif., October 29, 2024 — NKGen Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq: NKGN) (“NKGen” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative autologous and allogeneic natural killer cell therapeutics, today announced the presentation of two posters, on its first-in-kind, autologous, non-genetically modified NK cell product, troculeucel, in Alzheimer’s Disease (“AD”). The posters entitled, “Use of Non-genetically Modified Natural Killer Cells (SNK01) With Enhanced Activity in Subjects with Active Alzheimer’s Disease. Further Biomarker Analysis and Implications for Use in Prevention” and “Treatment of Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease Subjects with Expanded Non-genetically Modified Natural Killer Cells (troculeucel; SNK01) with Enhanced Activity – Report of the Phase 1 results of the Phase 1/2a Study” were presented at the 17th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease Annual Meeting (“CTAD”) on October 29, 2024.\n\nNKGen previously showed, in a dose-escalation Phase 1 pilot trial, that four treatments with suboptimal doses of troculeucel in AD subjects were well-tolerated and had preliminary ability to impact cognition and improve protein and neuroinflammation biomarkers. Based on recent publications by Guo et. al., and Johansson et. al., which both reported the detection of several biomarkers a full decade before patients developed clinical symptoms of dementia, NKGen reanalyzed its biobank to determine if troculeucel effected specific biomarkers (e.g., GFAP, NfL, p-tau181, GDF-15, and LTBP2) implicated with increased AD risk.\n\n“Despite the majority of subjects receiving suboptimal dosing and only four total doses in the Phase 1 pilot trial, we found that our autologous NK cell treatment was safe and that 90% of evaluable subjects experienced stable or improved cognitive function,” said Paul Y. Song, MD, Chairman and CEO of NKGen. “We also revealed that several subjects demonstrated reductions in several neuroinflammation biomarkers, such as GFAP, NfL, p-tau181, GDF-15, and LTBP2. We believe that increased screening for these biomarkers in asymptomatic individuals may reveal that troculeucel, which potentially reduces the associated biomarkers, could be a safe intervention to either delay, or prevent the onset of, dementia. However, further studies are needed to confirm these initial findings.”\n\nFor the follow-up Phase 1/2a trial on moderate Alzheimer’s patients, the Company hypothesized that troculeucel, given at the highest dose to date of 6 billion cells, could be safely infused and hopes to confirm an even greater impact on cognition and biomarkers.\n\nDr. Song added, “While 35% of all Alzheimer’s patients have moderate-stage disease, there is currently no approved therapy to improve cognitive function, let alone stop and/or slow cognitive decline, in this patient population. We have since initiated a Phase 1/2a trial using our highest dose of cryopreserved troculeucel in moderate AD subjects. We observed stable or improved cognitive function and no treatment-related adverse events after just three months of treatment. Notably, two of the three enrolled subjects in the Phase 1 cohort showed clinical improvement from moderate to mild AD based on ADCOMS and CDR-SB scores. Based on our promising [data to date](https://nkgenbiotech.com/nkgen-biotechs-positive-phase-1-clinical-data-in-moderate-alzheimers-disease-advances-troculeucel-into-phase-2-with-first-patient-dosed-in-phase-1-2a-trial/), we have already dosed the first two subjects in our double-blind, randomized Phase 2 cohort; and, look forward to sharing data updates when available. We are excited about the potential of troculeucel as a treatment for AD as well as the potential utility for it across other tau- and synuclein-related neurodegenerative diseases.”\n\n**_Data Highlights from the Poster Presentations:_**\n\nPoster entitled “Use of Non-genetically Modified Natural Killer Cells (SNK01) With Enhanced Activity in Subjects with Active Alzheimer’s Disease. Further Biomarker Analysis and Implications for Use in Prevention”:\n\n  * Eleven subjects (5 males and 6 females) enrolled. \n    * 10 subjects were evaluable.\n    * Median age was 79 years (56 to 85 years).\n  * Despite 70% of subjects being treated at relatively low doses of troculeucel, 90% of all evaluable subjects had either stable or improved (±0.1) composite ADCOMS scores at Week 11 (one-week after the final dose) as [previously disclosed](https://nkgenbiotech.com/nkgen-biotech-presents-new-positive-snk01-biomarker-data-at-the-2024-alzheimers-association-international-conference/).\n  * One-week post-final dose, improvement in CSF biomarkers were observed in 70% p-Tau181, 60% AB42/40 ratio, 60% GFAP, 40% GDF-15, 30% LTBP2, and 30% NF-L.\n  * Despite suboptimal dosing for two/thirds of the subjects, troculeucel was able to positively affect biomarkers that are associated with increased AD development.\n  * No treatment related adverse events were observed.\n  * Results from this study suggest troculeucel could potentially be a safe preventative intervention for individuals at high-risk for AD.\n  * Further evaluation of neuroinflammation biomarkers related to predicting risk of AD and dementia would be beneficial to support the investigation.\n\n\n\nPoster entitled “Treatment of Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease Subjects with Expanded Non-genetically Modified Natural Killer Cells (troculeucel; SNK01) with Enhanced Activity – Report of the Phase 1 results of the Phase 1/2a Study”:\n\n  * Three (3) subjects were enrolled in the Phase 1 cohort.\n  * Early review of the data shows that after three months’ treatment with a dose of 6 x 109 cells every 3 weeks: \n    * Clinical improvement was seen in two/thirds of the subjects, who went from a moderate to a mild AD rating on the CDR-SB scale.\n    * All three subjects had either a stable or improved ADCOMS score.\n  * No treatment-related clinical or laboratory adverse reactions were seen; and, well tolerated in moderate AD subjects. Findings are similar to the SNK01-MX04 Phase 1 AD study (NCT04678453), where troculeucel was well-tolerated, and the one moderate AD subject who received a dose of 4 x 109 cells also went from a moderate to a mild rating on the CDR-SB.\n  * This study aims to confirm previous preliminary efficacy seen on both cognitive and biomarker changes in AD subjects.\n  * Troculeucel will be evaluated for safety and efficacy in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a part of the study.\n\n\n\nCopies of the posters are available on the Scientific Publications page of the Company’s website at <https://nkgenbiotech.com/>. Previously disclosed Phase 1 data on the positive effects of troculeucel on amyloid, tau, and neuroinflammation biomarkers in Alzheimer’s patients can also be found on the Scientific Publications webpage.\n\n**About Troculeucel**\n\nTroculeucel is a novel cell-based, patient specific ex vivo expanded autologous natural killer (“NK”) cell, immunotherapeutic drug candidate.
