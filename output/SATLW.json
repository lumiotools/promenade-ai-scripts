(NASDAQ: SATL), a leader in sub-meter resolution Earth Observation (“EO”) data collection, today announced that it has been onboarded as a commercial vendor in the Global Data Marketplace (“GDMP”), a real-time e-commerce platform delivering commercially sourced data and data fusion analytics to meet the not classified space awareness needs for the US and international agencies, including US Space Force. \n\nThe Global Data Marketplace connects vendors and consumers of commercial space data on a single platform. This modern approach allows immediate interaction, immediate payment, and anonymous data acquisition for approved commercial, government, academic, and allied sector participants. Satellogic is now able to leverage a streamlined, online process to work with federal agencies and contractors. \n\nThrough the e-commerce GDMP, Satellogic will be able to 1) market and sell our product to consumers, 2) create order proposals to bid on consumer placed orders, and 3) service accepted orders. \n\nThe US Government continues to advance the commercial space sector, and earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense released an updated classification policy – advancing the National Defense Strategy by expanding access to information within the U.S. government and reducing barriers to space integration with allies, partners, and commercial space actors. \n\nThe Global Data Marketplace is another example of the US Government’s efforts to disrupt traditional procurement methodologies and lowering barriers for commercial providers, including those with international heritage. The acceptance from the GDMP is a major step towards Satellogic’s goal of becoming a mission critical partner for US and international agencies and presents a welcome opportunity to showcase the company’s capabilities. \n\n“We are excited that the US Government is taking an innovative and disruptive approach to procurement and leveraging a broader set of commercial capabilities,” said Matt Tirman, President, Satellogic. “Satellogic’s portfolio of cost-effective, low-latency, and high-resolution electro-optical imaging is a great benefit to this platform since it gives government users the ability to easily and affordably purchase directly from Satellogic.” \n\nSatellogic operates the largest commercial fleet of submeter-resolution EO satellites in the world and provides EO data to governments and corporations for better decision-making. Its mission is to advance cost-efficiencies as well as rapidly iterate its proprietary technology to expand affordable access to critical information about the planet and life on Earth. \n\n**About Satellogic**\n\nFounded in 2010 by Emiliano Kargieman and Gerardo Richarte, Satellogic (NASDAQ: SATL) is the first vertically integrated geospatial company, driving real outcomes with planetary-scale insights. Satellogic is creating and continuously enhancing the first scalable, fully automated EO platform with the ability to remap the entire planet at both high frequency and high resolution, providing accessible and affordable solutions for customers. \n\nSatellogic’s mission is to democratize access to geospatial data through its information platform of high-resolution images to help solve the world’s most pressing problems including climate change, energy supply, and food security. Using its patented Earth imaging technology, Satellogic unlocks the power of EO to deliver high-quality, planetary insights at the lowest cost in the industry. \n\nWith more than a decade of experience in space, Satellogic has proven technology and a strong track record of delivering satellites to orbit and high-resolution data to customers at the right price point. \n\nTo learn more, please visit: [https://satellogic.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatellogic.com&esheet=53972229&newsitemid=20240506933141&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fsatellogic.com&index=2&md5=4214abe40aa39a341e9ea927452186cf)\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. The words “anticipate”, “believe”, “continue”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intends”, “may”, “might”, “plan”, “possible”, “potential”, “predict”, “project”, “should”, “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are based on Satellogic’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on Satellogic and include statements concerning Satellogic’s strategies, including its plans to redomicile in the U.S., Satellogic’s future opportunities and financial performance, and the commercial and governmental applications for Satellogic’s technology. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve, and must not be relied on by an investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Satellogic. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to generate revenue as expected, (ii) our ability to effectively market and sell our EO services and to convert contracted revenues and our pipeline of potential contracts into actual revenues, (iii), (iii) the potential loss of one or more of our largest customers, (iv) the considerable time and expense related to our sales efforts and the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle, (v) risks and uncertainties associated with defense-related contracts, (vi) our ability to scale production of our satellites as planned, (vii) unforeseen risks, challenges and uncertainties related to our expansion into new business lines, (viii) our dependence on third parties to transport and launch our satellites into space, (ix) our reliance on third party vendors and manufacturers to build and provide certain satellite components, products, or services, (x) market acceptance of our EO services and our dependence upon our ability to keep pace with the latest technological advances, (xi) competition for EO services, (xii) unknown defects or errors in our products, (xiii) risk related to the capital-intensive nature of our business and our ability to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies, (xiv) uncertainties beyond our control related to the production, launch, commissioning, and/or operation of our satellites and related ground systems, software and analytic technologies, (xv) the failure of the market for EO services to achieve the growth potential we expect, (xvi) risks related to our satellites and related equipment becoming impaired, (xvii) risks related to the failure of our satellites to operate as intended, (xviii) production and launch delays, launch failures, and damage or destruction to our satellites during launch and (xix) the impact of natural disasters, unusual or prolonged unfavorable weather conditions, epidemic outbreaks, terrorist acts and geopolitical events (including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, in the Gaza Strip and the Red Sea region) on our business and satellite launch schedules. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of Satellogic’s Annual Report on Form 20-F and other documents filed or to be filed by Satellogic from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and Satellogic assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Satellogic can give no assurance that it will achieve its expectations. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240506933141r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240506933141/en/>\n\n**Investor Relations:** MZ Group Chris Tyson/Larry Holub (949) 491-8235 SATL@mzgroup.us  **Media Relations:** Satellogic pr@satellogic.com\n\nSource: Satellogic Inc.\n"

(NASDAQ: SATL), a leader in sub-meter resolution Earth Observation (“EO”) data collection, today announced the release of a large open dataset of high-resolution imagery, curated from the company’s archive, to support the training of foundation models. \n\nThe dataset contains around 3 million Satellogic images of unique locations — 6 million images, including location revisits — from around the world. Each image is 384 by 384 pixels, totaling 900 Gigapixels spanning different land-use types, objects, geographies, and seasons. The full dataset can be accessed on [Hugging Face](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fdatasets%2Fsatellogic%2FEarthView&esheet=53970119&newsitemid=20240501843577&lan=en-US&anchor=Hugging+Face&index=2&md5=0afc120697d56f17c39bcd51f8c28d28). \n\n\"Following a stream of recent publications, with the release of this large dataset we aim to accelerate the development of foundational models in the field of EO,\" said Javier Marin, Applied AI Director at Satellogic. “Instead of relying on analysts to manually select and process satellite images, we will soon start interacting with large Earth Observation AI models with access to high-resolution, real-time imagery of our planet to derive those insights.” \n\nSatellogic data is released under a Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license, allowing for commercial use of the data with attribution. \n\nA paper presenting the dataset will be published along with the release of a baseline foundation model, a masked autoencoder (scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision), built on top of it. The paper describes how the dataset is built, the model architecture and experimental setup. This work is the result of Satellogic’s collaboration with an exceptional team of researchers led by Alexandre Lacoste at ServiceNow under Yoshua Bengio’s guidance. \n\nFor additional information and imagery please see the blog post [Satellogic open-source release: A large dataset of high-resolution imagery for AI model training](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatellogic.com%2F2024%2F05%2F01%2Fsatellogic-open-source-release-a-large-dataset-of-high-resolution-imagery-for-ai-model-training%2F&esheet=53970119&newsitemid=20240501843577&lan=en-US&anchor=Satellogic+open-source+release%3A+A+large+dataset+of+high-resolution+imagery+for+AI+model+training&index=3&md5=6eb93e841501a8fc987980d2a0937b90) published on the Satellogic website. \n\n**About Satellogic**\n\nFounded in 2010 by Emiliano Kargieman and Gerardo Richarte, Satellogic (NASDAQ: SATL) is the first vertically integrated geospatial company, driving real outcomes with planetary-scale insights.
