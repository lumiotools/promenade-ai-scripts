The members of the Committee are not full-time employees of the Company and may\nor may not be accountants or auditors by profession or experts in the fields of accounting or auditing and, in\nany event, do not serve in such capacity. Consequently, it is not the duty of the Committee to conduct audits or\nto determine that the Companyâs financial statements and disclosures are complete and accurate and are in\naccordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (âGAAPâ) and other Applicable Requirements.\nThese are the responsibilities of management and the Companyâs independent registered public accounting\nfirm.\nII.

          "content": "CARTICA ACQUISITION CORP\nCode of Conduct and Ethics\nI. Introduction\nThe Company requires the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct from its employees, officers and\ndirectors. Our reputation for honesty and integrity is key to the success of its business. The Company intends that its\nbusiness practices will comply with the laws of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates and that honesty, integrity\nand accountability will always characterize the Companyâs business activity. No employee, officer or director may\nachieve results through violations of laws or regulations or unscrupulous dealings.\nThis Code reflects the Companyâs commitment to this culture of honesty, integrity and accountability and outlines\nthe basic principles and policies with which all employees, officers and directors are expected to comply. Therefore,\nwe expect you to read this Code thoroughly and carefully.\nIn addition to following this Code in all aspects of your business activities, you are expected to seek guidance in any\nsituation where there is a question regarding compliance issues, whether with the letter or the spirit of the\nCompanyâs policies and applicable laws. Cooperation with this Code is essential to the continued success of the\nCompanyâs business and the cultivation and maintenance of its reputation as a good corporate citizen. Misconduct is\nnever justified, even where sanctioned or ordered by an officer or other individual in a position of higher\nmanagement. No individual, regardless of stature or position, can authorize actions that are illegal, or that jeopardize\nor violate Company standards. We note that this Code sets forth general principles of conduct and ethics and is\nintended to work in conjunction with specific policies and procedures that the Company may adopt, including\nwithout limitation in the form of a compliance manual, separate specific policy statements or otherwise, and you\nshould refer to those policies and procedures for more detail in the specified context.\nNothing in this Code prohibits you from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any\ngovernmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under\nthe whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. You do not need the prior authorization of the Company to\nmake any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify the Company that you have made such\nreports or disclosures.\nII. Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest occurs when your private interest interferes, appears to interfere or is inconsistent in any way\nwith the interests of the Company. For example, conflicts of interest may arise if:\nâ You cause the Company to engage in business transactions with a company that you, your friends or your\nrelatives control without having obtained the appropriate prior approvals required.\nâ You are in a position to (i) compete with, rather than help, the Company or (ii) make a business decision not on\nthe basis of the Companyâs interest but rather for your own personal advantage.\nâ You take actions, or have personal or family interests, which may make it difficult to perform your work (or\ndischarge your duties and obligations) effectively.\n1\nâ You, or any of your family members or affiliates, receive improper personal benefits other than gratuities and\npayments received or provided in compliance with the guidelines set forth in âGifts and Entertainmentâ below,\nas a result of your position in the Company.\nA conflict of interest may not be immediately recognizable, so potential conflicts must be reported immediately to\nthe Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Further, if you become aware of a conflict or potential conflict\ninvolving another employee, officer or director, you should bring it to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or\na member of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors at the principal executive offices of the Company.\nIf the concern requires confidentiality, including keeping particular individuals anonymous, then this confidentially\nwill be protected, except to the extent necessary to conduct an effective investigation or as required under applicable\nlaw, regulation or legal proceedings.\nIII. Related Party Transactions\nThe Company has adopted a policy that requires the review and approval of any transaction, arrangement or\nrelationship where the Company was, is or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in\nwhich any âRelated Personâ (generally defined as any director (or director nominee) or executive officer of the\nCompany, beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company shares, any immediate family member of the\nforegoing and any entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a partner or principal or in which\nthat person has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest) had, has or will have a direct or indirect material\ninterest.\nBefore entering any such transaction, arrangement or relationship, the Chief Financial Officer must be notified of the\nfacts and circumstances of the proposed transaction, arrangement or relationship. If the Chief Financial Officer\ndetermines that a transaction, arrangement or relationship is indeed a related party transaction, then such transaction\nwill be sent to the Audit Committee (or the Chair of such committee) for their review and approval. Only those\ntransactions that are in the best interests of the Company shall be approved.\nIV. Corporate Opportunities\nWhen carrying out your duties or responsibilities, you owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests.\nThe Companyâs certificate of incorporation and corporate governance guidelines contain important policies with\nrespect to corporate opportunities.\nV. Public Reporting\nFull, fair, accurate and timely disclosure must be made in the reports and other documents that the Company files\nwith, or submits to, the SEC and in its other public communications. Such disclosure is critical to ensure that the\nCompany maintains its good reputation, complies with its obligations under the securities laws and meets the\nexpectations of its shareholders.\nPersons responsible for the preparation of such documents and reports and other public communications must\nexercise the highest standard of care in accordance with the following guidelines:\nâ all accounting records, and the reports produced from such records, must comply with all applicable laws;\nâ all accounting records must fairly and accurately reflect the transactions or occurrences to which they relate;\n2\nâ all accounting records must fairly and accurately reflect in reasonable detail the Companyâs assets, liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses;\nâ accounting records must not contain any false or intentionally misleading entries;\nâ no transactions should be intentionally misclassified as to accounts, departments or accounting periods;\nâ all transactions must be supported by accurate documentation in reasonable detail and recorded in the proper\naccount and in the proper accounting period;\nâ no information should be concealed from the internal auditors or the independent auditors; and\nâ compliance with the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures\nis required.\nVI. Confidentiality\nEmployees, officers and directors must maintain and protect the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by\nthe Company, or that otherwise comes into their possession, during the course of their employment or while carrying\nout their duties and responsibilities, except when disclosure is authorized by the Company or legally mandated.\nThe obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after employees, officers and directors leave the\nCompany.\nConfidential information encompasses all non-public information (including, for example, âinside informationâ or\ninformation that third-parties have entrusted to the Company) that may be of use to competitors, or may otherwise\nbe harmful to the Company or its key stakeholders, if disclosed. Financial information is of special sensitivity and\nshould under all circumstances be considered confidential, except where its disclosure is approved by the Company\nor when the information has been publicly disseminated.\nVII. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll employees, officers and directors should promote and ensure the efficient and responsible use of the Companyâs\nassets and resources by the Company. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Companyâs\nprofitability. Any suspected incidents of fraud or theft should be immediately reported for investigation.\nCompany assets, such as proprietary information, funds, materials, supplies, products, equipment, software,\nfacilities, and other assets owned or leased by the Company or that are otherwise in the Companyâs possession, may\nonly be used for legitimate business purposes and must never be used for illegal purposes.\nProprietary information includes any information that is not generally known to the public or would be valued by, or\nhelpful to, our competitors. Examples of proprietary information are intellectual property, business and strategic\nplans and employee information. The obligation to use proprietary information only for legitimate business purposes\ncontinues even after individuals leave the Company.\n3\nVIII. Insider Trading\nInsider trading is unethical and illegal. Employees, officers and directors must not trade in securities of a company\nwhile in possession of material non-public information regarding that company. It is also illegal to âtipâ or pass on\ninside information to any other person who might make an investment decision based on that information or pass the\ninformation to third parties. The Company has an Insider Trading Policy, which sets forth obligations in respect of\ntrading in the Companyâs securities.\nIX. Fair Dealing\nEach employee, officer and director, in carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities, should endeavor to deal\nfairly with each other and the Companyâs customers, suppliers and competitors. No employee, officer or director\nshould take unfair advantage of anyone through illegal conduct, manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged\ninformation, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.\nX. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nCompliance with both the letter and spirit of all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company, including any\nsecurities exchange or other organization or body that regulates the Company, is critical to our reputation and\ncontinued success. All employees, officers and directors must respect and obey the laws of the cities, states and\ncountries in which the Company operates and avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\nEmployees, officers or directors who fail to comply with this Code and applicable laws will be subject to\ndisciplinary measures, up to and including discharge from the Company.\nXI. Compliance with Antitrust Laws.\nThe Company believes in fair and open competition, and adheres strictly to applicable antitrust laws. It should be\nnoted however that the following section is not an exhaustive summary of relevant antitrust laws. Additional\nantitrust considerations not covered in this section include participation in trade association, monopolization, price\ndiscrimination and other practices that affect competition.\nAs a general proposition, any contact with a competitor may be problematic under antitrust laws. Accordingly, all\nemployees, officers and directors should avoid any such contact relating to the business of the Company or the\ncompetitor without first obtaining the approval of the Chief Financial Officer. Any additional concerns relating to\nthe aforementioned areas of potential antitrust breach should also be directed to the Chief Financial Officer.\nThe Company notes below some general rules concerning contact with competitors:\nâ Agreements among competitors, whether written or oral, that relate to prices are illegal per se. In other words,\nsuch agreements, by themselves, constitute violations of the antitrust laws. There are no circumstances under\nwhich agreements among competitors relating to prices may be found legal. Price fixing is a criminal offense,\nand may subject the Company to substantial fines and penalties and the offending employee to imprisonment\nand fines.\nâ Antitrust laws may be violated even in the absence of a formal agreement relating to prices. Under certain\ncircumstances, an agreement to fix prices may be inferred from conduct, such as the exchange of price\ninformation, and from communications among competitors even without an express understanding. Although\n4\nexchanges of price information are permitted in certain circumstances, employees of the Company should not\nparticipate in such exchanges without first obtaining the approval of the Chief Financial Officer.\nâ It is a per se violation of antitrust laws for competitors to agree, expressly or by implication, to divide markets\nby territory or customers.\nâ It is a per se violation of the antitrust laws for competitors to agree not to do business with a particular customer\nor supplier. As with agreements to fix prices, the antitrust laws can be violated even in the absence of an express\nunderstanding.\nâ Any communication between competitors concerning problems with any customer or supplier may violate\nantitrust laws and should be avoided.\nXII. Compliance with Environmental Laws\nThe Company is sensitive to the environmental, health and safety consequences of its operations. Accordingly, the\nCompany strictly complies with all applicable Federal and State environmental laws and regulations, including,\namong others, the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery\nAct and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and considers sustainability in its planning decisions. If any\nindividual has any doubt as to the applicability or meaning of a particular environmental, health or safety regulation,\nhe or she should discuss the matter with the Chief Financial Officer.\nXIII. Discrimination and Harassment\nThe Company values a diverse working environment and is committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects\nof our business. Abusive, harassing or offensive conduct is unacceptable, whether verbal, physical or visual.\nExamples include derogatory comments based on racial or ethnic characteristics and unwelcome sexual advances.\nThe Company encourages the reporting of harassment when it occurs.\nXIV. Safety and Health\nThe Company is committed to keeping its workplaces free from hazards. You should report any accidents, injuries or\nunsafe equipment, practices or conditions immediately to a supervisor or other designated person. Threats or acts of\nviolence or physical intimidation are prohibited.\nYou must not engage in the use of any substance that could prevent you from discharging your work duties and\nresponsibilities safely and effectively.\nXV. Company Records and Document Retention\nRecords created, received or used during the conduct of Company business, including all communications sent or\nreceived using the Companyâs email system, are at all times the property of the Company wherever those records\nmay be located. At any time, the Company and, in certain circumstances, third parties (including government\nofficials), may review, without prior notice to personnel, any and all firm records, including records marked\nâPersonalâ or âPrivate.â\n5\nAny records that you create and store are subject to this Code and may be demanded by third parties during the\ncourse of litigation or a government investigation or, in the case of records sent outside the Company, subject to the\nrecords retention policies of the recipients.\nYou should, therefore, avoid discriminatory remarks, harassment and threats of violence or similar inappropriate or\nunlawful conduct. This applies to communications of all kinds, including e-mail, instant messaging, voice mail\nmessages, text messages, video recordings and informal notes or interoffice memos. Records should be retained and\ndestroyed in accordance with the Companyâs records retention policy.\nXVI. Use of Electronic Media\nThe Company has developed a policy to ensure that you understand the rules governing your use of the Companyâs\ncomputer network, and options for e-mail and voicemail or other messaging services, Internet access or other use of\nelectronic media. All Company equipment, including desks, computers and computer systems, computer software,\nelectronic storage devices, cellphones or other mobile devices, e-mail, voicemail and other physical items are for\nbusiness use only. The Company at all times retains the right to access and search all such electronic media or other\nitems contained in or used in conjunction with the Companyâs computer, e-mail, voicemail and Internet access\nsystems and equipment with no prior notice.\nLike the Companyâs computer network, e-mail and voicemail services, access to Internet services such as\nweb-browsing or newsgroups is provided to employees by the Company only for business use. Any personal use\nmust be infrequent and must not involve any prohibited activity, interfere with the productivity of the employee or\nhis or her coworkers, consume system resources or storage capacity on an ongoing basis or involve large file\ntransfers or otherwise deplete system resources available for business purposes.\nYour messages and computer information are considered Company property and consequently, employees should\nnot have an expectation of privacy in the context of computer and voice mail use. Unless prohibited by law, the\nCompany reserves the right to access and disclose this information as necessary for business purposes. Use good\njudgment, and do not access, send messages or store any information that you would not want to be seen or heard by\nother individuals.\nThe Company also recognizes that many employees are choosing to express themselves by using Internet\ntechnologies, such as blogs, wikis, file-sharing, user generated audio and video, virtual worlds, and social\nnetworking sites, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Whether you choose to participate in such social\nnetworking outside of work on your own time is your own decision.\nXVII. Business Gifts and Entertainment\nBusiness gifts and entertainment are often customary courtesies designed to build goodwill among business partners\nand clients. However, issues may arise when such courtesies compromise, or appear to compromise, the recipientâs\nability to make objective and fair business decisions. In addition, issues can arise when the intended recipient is a\ngovernment official. Offering or receiving any gift, gratuity or entertainment that might be perceived to unfairly\ninfluence a business relationship should be avoided. These guidelines apply at all times, and do not change during\ntraditional gift giving seasons, and apply equally to employees, officers or directors offering gifts and entertainment\nto the Companyâs business associates.\nThe value of gifts should be nominal, both with respect to frequency and monetary amount. Frequent gifting to a\nrecipient may be perceived as an attempt to create an obligation to the giver, and is therefore inappropriate.\nLikewise, business entertainment should be moderately scaled and intended only to facilitate legitimate business\ngoals. For example, should tickets to a sporting or cultural event be offered, the offeror must attend the event as\nwell. The following questions may provide guidance in the instance of doubt:\n6\nâ Is the action legal?\nâ Does the action raise doubts or concerns?\nâ Should another individual be consulted?\nâ Is the action clearly business-related?\nâ Is the action or gift moderate, reasonable, and in good taste?\nâ Would public disclosure of the action or gift embarrass or harm the Company?\nâ Is there an expectation of reciprocation or favors?\nStrict rules apply when the Company does business with governmental agencies and officials, whether in the U.S. or\nin other countries, as discussed in more detail below.\nBecause of the sensitive nature of these relationships, you must seek approval from a supervisor and/or the Chief\nFinancial Officer before offering or making any gifts or hospitality to governmental officials or employees.\nXVIII. Political Activities and Contributions\nThe Company respects the right of each of its employees to participate in the political process and to engage in\npolitical activities of his or her choosing; however, while involved in their personal and civic affairs employees must\nmake clear at all times that their views and actions are their own, and not those of the Company. Employees may not\nuse the Companyâs resources to support their choice of political parties, causes or candidates.\nThe Company may occasionally express its views on local and national issues that affect its operations. In such\ncases, Company funds and resources may be used, but only when permitted by law and by Company guidelines. The\nCompany may also make limited contributions to political parties or candidates in jurisdictions where it is legal and\ncustomary to do so. The Company may pay related administrative and solicitation costs for political action\ncommittees formed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Any use of Company resources for the\nCompanyâs political activities, including contributions or donations, requires advance approval by the Companyâs\nChief Financial Officer.\nXIX. Bribery and Corruption\nEmployees, officers and directors must comply with all laws prohibiting bribery, corruption and kickbacks,\nincluding laws prohibiting improper payments to domestic and foreign officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act (the âFCPAâ). While this section focusesprimarily on foreign officials, this policy equally prohibits\nbribery of domestic officials and commercial or private sector parties.\nThe FCPA prohibits an offer, payment, promise of payment or authorization of the payment of any money or thing\nof value to a foreign official, foreign political party, official of a foreign political party or candidate for political\noffice to induce or influence any act or decision of such person or party or to secure any improper advantage. The\nFCPA prohibits such conduct whether done directly or indirectly through an agent or other intermediary.\n7\nAlthough U.S. law does allow certain payments to foreign officials intended solely to expedite non-discretionary\nroutine government action, sometimes called âgreaseâ or âfacilitatingâ payments, this exception is a narrow one and\nsuch payments are often illegal under other laws. Accordingly, the Companyâs policy is to avoid such payments.\nTherefore, no payment may be made to a foreign official even for non-discretionary action without first consulting\nwith and obtaining written authorization from the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer. If a\nfacilitating payment is authorized, such payment must be accurately and fairly recorded in the Companyâs books,\nrecords and accounts.\nThe FCPA further requires compliance by the Company with record keeping and internal controls requirements. The\nCompany must maintain financial records which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and\ndisposition of corporate assets. In particular, all bank accounts that receive or disburse funds on behalf of the\nCompany shall be properly authorized and any such transactions recorded on the official books and records of the\nCompany. In addition, the Company must maintain a system of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable\nassurances that the Companyâs assets are used only in accordance with directives and authorizations by the board of\ndirectors and senior management, and that checks and balances are employed so as to prevent the by-passing or\noverriding of these controls.\nViolation of the FCPA is an offense, subjecting the Company to substantial fines and penalties and any officer,\ndirector, employee or shareholder acting on behalf of the Company to imprisonment and fines. The FCPA prohibits\nthe Company from paying, directly or indirectly, a fine imposed upon an individual pursuant to the FCPA. Violation\nof this policy may result in disciplinary actions up to and including discharge from the Company.\nXX. Compliance with and Amendments of This Code\nFailure to comply with this Code or applicable laws, rules or regulations may result in disciplinary measures,\nincluding discharge from your position with the Company. Violations of this Code may also constitute violations of\nlaw and may result in civil or criminal penalties for such person, such personâs supervisors and/or the Company.
