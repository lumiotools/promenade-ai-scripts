Announces 2024 Third Quarter Results\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights:**\n\n  * **Net income available to common shareholders of****$16.2 million****, or****$0.74****per diluted share**\n  * **Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision earnings of****$27.5 million**\n  * **Tangible book value per share increased to****$24.90****, compared to****$23.36****at****June 30, 2024**\n  * **Common equity tier 1 capital ratio improved to****9.00%****, compared to****8.64%****at June 30, 2024**\n  * **Net interest margin of****3.10%****, compared to****3.12%****in prior quarter**\n  * **Efficiency ratio of****62.8%****, compared to****65.2%****in prior quarter**\n\n\n\nEFFINGHAM, Ill., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Midland States Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: MSBI) (the “Company”) today reported net income available to common shareholders of $16.2 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $4.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024. This also compares to net income available to common shareholders of $9.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nProvision expense was $5.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $16.8 million and $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively. The elevated provision expense in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to credit deterioration and servicing issues involving one of our fintech partners, LendingPoint, subsequent to their system conversion in late 2023.\n\nJeffrey G. Ludwig, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said, “We executed well in the third quarter and delivered a higher level of profitability while making continued progress on our balance sheet management strategies, which resulted in further increases in all of our capital ratios, an increase in our tangible book value per share, and an increase in our level of liquidity with a reduction in our loan-to-deposit ratio. We continue to utilize the payoffs resulting from the intentional reduction of our equipment finance and consumer portfolios to fund high quality loans generated in our community bank and the purchase of investment securities. We are also seeing good results from the investments we have made in the business, such as increasing our presence and business development efforts in the St. Louis market, where our loan balances increased at an annualized rate of 12% during the third quarter, and growth in our Wealth Management revenues due to an increase in assets under administration, partially driven by the new wealth advisors we have added in recent quarters.\n\nImproving our credit quality is a priority and we are taking proactive steps to resolve problem loans in order to reduce our level of non-performing and classified loans going forward. We continue to closely monitor the health of our borrowers and be conservative in downgrading loans where we see the potential for weakness. We also recently added a new Chief Credit Officer whose background and experience is consistent with our increased focus on in-market relationship lending in our community bank, which will continue to result in a higher quality, lower risk loan portfolio.\n\n“While we will remain conservative in new loan production while economic conditions remain uncertain, we are well positioned to benefit from lower interest rates and we expect positive trends in our net interest margin and revenue generated from our Wealth Management business. While maintaining disciplined expense control, we are continuing to make investments in talent and technology that will further enhance our ability to increase our market share, add attractive new client relationships in our community bank, and generate profitable growth. With the stronger balance sheet we are building, including a Total Capital Ratio of approximately 14%, we believe we are well positioned to support the continued growth of our franchise as economic conditions improve in the future and create additional value for our shareholders in the process,” said Mr. Ludwig.\n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\nTotal assets were $7.75 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $7.76 billion at June 30, 2024, and $7.97 billion at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, portfolio loans were $5.75 billion, compared to $5.85 billion at June 30, 2024, and $6.28 billion at September 30, 2023.\n\n_Loans_\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, outstanding loans declined by $103.2 million, or 1.8%, from June 30, 2024, as the Company continued to shrink its equipment financing and consumer loan portfolios, and focus on commercial loan opportunities in our community banking regions.\n\nEquipment finance loan and lease balances decreased $30.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 as the Company continued to reduce its concentration of this product within the overall loan portfolio. Consumer loans decreased $82.8 million due to loan payoffs and a cessation in loans originated through GreenSky. Our Greensky-originated loan balances decreased $63.0 million during the third quarter to $475.3 million at September 30, 2024. In addition, as previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company ceased originating loans through LendingPoint. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $96.5 million in loans that were originated through and serviced by LendingPoint. Equipment financing and consumer loans comprised 15.0% and 11.5%, respectively, of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, compared to 15.2% and 12.7%, respectively, at June 30, 2024.\n\nIncreases in commercial FHA warehouse lines and commercial real estate loans of $50.2 million and $89.0 million, respectively, were offset by decreases in all other loan categories.\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n**September 30 ,** | **June 30 ,** | **March 31 ,** | **December 31 ,** | **September 30 ,**  \n_(in thousands)_ | **2024** | **2024** | **2024** | **2023** | **2023**  \n**Loan Portfolio**  \nCommercial loans | $ | 863,922 | $ | 939,458 | $ | 913,564 | $ | 951,387 | $ | 943,761  \nEquipment finance loans | 442,552 | 461,409 | 494,068 | 531,143 | 578,931  \nEquipment finance leases | 417,531 | 428,659 | 455,879 | 473,350 | 485,460  \nCommercial FHA warehouse lines | 50,198 | — | 8,035 | — | 48,547  \nTotal commercial loans and leases | 1,774,203 | 1,829,526 | 1,871,546 | 1,955,880 | 2,056,699  \nCommercial real estate | 2,510,472 | 2,421,505 | 2,397,113 | 2,406,845 | 2,412,164  \nConstruction and land development | 422,253 | 476,528 | 474,128 | 452,593 | 416,801  \nResidential real estate | 378,657 | 378,393 | 378,583 | 380,583 | 375,211  \nConsumer | 663,234 | 746,042 | 837,092 | 935,178 | 1,020,008  \nTotal loans | $ | 5,748,819 | $ | 5,851,994 | $ | 5,958,462 | $ | 6,131,079 | $ | 6,280,883  \n  \n_Loan Quality_\n\nOverall, credit quality metrics remained consistent this quarter compared to the second quarter of 2024, albeit, nonperforming loans were still at elevated levels. Non-performing loans increased $2.4 million to $114.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $112.1 million as of June 30, 2024. Substandard loans increased $32.0 million to $167.5 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to June 30, 2024, primarily due to two multi-family projects that were downgraded this past quarter.\n\n**As of and for the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n_(in thousands)_ | **September 30 ,** | **June 30 ,** | **March 31 ,** | **December 31 ,** | **September 30 ,**  \n**2024** | **2024** | **2024** | **2023** | **2023**  \n**Asset Quality**  \nLoans 30-89 days past due | $ | 55,329 | $ | 54,045 | $ | 58,854 | $ | 82,778 | $ | 46,608  \nNonperforming loans | 114,556 | 112,124 | 104,979 | 56,351 | 55,981  \nNonperforming assets | 126,771 | 123,774 | 116,721 | 67,701 | 58,677  \nSubstandard loans | 167,549 | 135,555 | 149,049 | 184,224 | 143,793  \nNet charge-offs | 11,379 | 2,874 | 4,445 | 5,117 | 3,449  \nLoans 30-89 days past due to total loans | 0.96 | % | 0.92 | % | 0.99 | % | 1.35 | % | 0.74 | %  \nNonperforming loans to total loans | 1.99 | % | 1.92 | % | 1.76 | % | 0.92 | % | 0.89 | %  \nNonperforming assets to total assets | 1.64 | % | 1.60 | % | 1.49 | % | 0.86 | % | 0.74 | %  \nAllowance for credit losses to total loans | 1.49 | % | 1.58 | % | 1.31 | % | 1.12 | % | 1.06 | %  \nAllowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans | 74.90 | % | 82.22 | % | 74.35 | % | 121.56 | % | 119.09 | %  \nNet charge-offs to average loans | 0.78 | % | 0.20 | % | 0.30 | % | 0.33 | % | 0.22 | %  \n  \nThe allowance for credit losses on loans totaled $85.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $92.2 million at June 30, 2024, and $66.7 million at September 30, 2023.
