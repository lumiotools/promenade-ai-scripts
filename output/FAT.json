          "content": "NEWS RELEASE\nFAT BRANDS INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2024\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\n2024-10-30\nConference call and webcast today at 5:00 p.m. ET\nLOS ANGELES, Oct. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FAT (Fresh. Authentic. Tasty.) Brands Inc. (NASDAQ: FAT) (“FAT\nBrands” or the “Company”) today reported \u0000nancial results for the \u0000scal third quarter ended September 29, 2024.\nAndy Wiederhorn, Chairman of FAT Brands, said, “Over the last three years, we have expanded our brand portfolio\nto include 18 distinct concepts while our footprint has increased tenfold, now encompassing over 2,300 locations\nacross more than 40 countries and 49 U.S. states or territories. We opened 22 new units during the third quarter,\nbringing our year-to-date openings to 71 new units and are on track to end the year with 100 new units.”\nWiederhorn added, “We have signed 225 development deals year-to-date versus 226 deals in all of 2023, bringing\nour current development pipeline to approximately 1,000 locations. This is a strong indicator of con\u0000dence within\nthe FAT franchise system.”\nKen Kuick, Co-Chief Executive O\u0000cer of FAT Brands, said, “We continue to prioritize accelerated growth in our\nPolished Casual category, particularly through Twin Peaks, our fastest-growing concept. Year to date, we opened\nnine new lodges, bringing our total to 115 locations. We also completed our \u0000rst Smokey Bones to Twin Peaks\nconversion in Lakeland, Florida during the third quarter, with our second conversion underway and several more\nplanned for next year.”\nRob Rosen, Co-Chief Executive O\u0000cer of FAT Brands, said, “In May, Twin Peaks and Smokey Bones, as a combined\n1\nentity, took a signi\u0000cant step towards becoming a standalone public company. We view this potential IPO or\nalternative transaction as a strategic opportunity to unlock value for FAT shareholders. Shortly, we intend to\nre\u0000nance Twin Peaks’ securitization debt, which will optimize our \u0000nancial structure prior to any IPO or other\ntransaction.”\nFiscal Third Quarter 2024 Highlights\nTotal revenue grew 31.1% to $143.4 million compared to $109.4 million in the \u0000scal third quarter of 2023\nSystem-wide sales grew 6.4% in the \u0000scal third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year \u0000scal quarter\nYear-to-date system-wide same-store sales declined 2.7% compared to the prior year\n22 new store openings during the \u0000scal third quarter of 2024\nNet loss of $44.8 million, or $2.74 per diluted share, compared to $24.7 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in\nthe \u0000scal third quarter of 2023\nEBITDA(1) of $1.7 million compared to $10.8 million in the \u0000scal third quarter of 2023\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) of $14.1 million compared to $21.9 million in the \u0000scal third quarter of 2023\nAdjusted net loss(1) of $38.0 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss(1) of $17.1\nmillion, or $1.14 per diluted share, in the \u0000scal third quarter of 2023\n(1) EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are non-GAAP measures de\u0000ned below, under “Non-GAAP\nMeasures”. Reconciliation of GAAP net loss to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are included in the\naccompanying \u0000nancial tables.\nSummary of Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nTotal revenue increased $34.0 million, or 31.1%, in the third quarter of 2024 to $143.4 million compared to $109.4\nmillion in the same period of 2023, driven by the acquisition of Smokey Bones in September 2023 and revenues\nfrom new restaurant openings.\nCosts and expenses consist of general and administrative expense, cost of restaurant and factory revenues,\ndepreciation and amortization, refranchising net loss and advertising fees. Costs and expenses increased $49.5\nmillion, or 48.1%, in the third quarter of 2024 to $152.2 million compared to the same period in the prior year,\nprimarily due to the acquisition of Smokey Bones in September 2023 and increased activity from Company-owned\nrestaurants and the Company's factory.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $10.0 million, or 41.0%, in the third quarter of 2024 to $34.5 million\ncompared to $24.5 million in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of Smokey Bones in\n2\nSeptember 2023 and increased professional fees related to pending litigation.\nCost of restaurant and factory revenues was related to the operations of the company-owned restaurant locations\nand dough factory and increased $37.6 million, or 63.6%, in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to the\nacquisition of Smokey Bones in September 2023 and higher company-owned restaurant sales.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3.7 million, or 52.5% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of Smokey Bones in September 2023 and depreciation of\nnew property and equipment at company-owned restaurant locations.\nRefranchising net loss, comprised of restaurant operating costs, net of food sales, was $0.2 million in the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nAdvertising expenses decreased $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. These\nexpenses vary in relation to advertising revenues.\nTotal other expense, net, for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was $35.8 million and $32.6 million, respectively,\nwhich is inclusive of interest expense of $35.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively. This increase is primarily due\nto new debt issuances. Total other expense, net, for the third quarter of 2023 also consisted of a $2.7 million net\nloss on the extinguishment of debt.\nAdjusted net loss(1) was $38.0 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss(1) of $17.1 million,\nor $1.14 per diluted share, in the \u0000scal third quarter of 2023.\nKey Financial De\u0000nitions\nNew store openings - The number of new store openings re\u0000ects the number of stores opened during a particular\nreporting period. The total number of new stores per reporting period and the timing of stores openings has, and\nwill continue to have, an impact on our results.\nSame-store sales growth - Same-store sales growth re\u0000ects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable\nstore base, which we de\u0000ne as the number of stores open and in the FAT Brands system for at least one full \u0000scal\nyear. For stores that were temporarily closed, sales in the current and prior period are adjusted accordingly. Given\nour focused marketing e\u0000orts and public excitement surrounding each opening, new stores often experience an\ninitial start-up period with considerably higher than average sales volumes, which subsequently decrease to\nstabilized levels after three to six months. Additionally, when we acquire a brand, it may take several months to\nintegrate fully each location of said brand into the FAT Brands platform. Thus, we do not include stores in the\n3\ncomparable base until they have been open and in the FAT Brands system for at least one full \u0000scal year.\nSystem-wide sales growth - System-wide sales growth re\u0000ects the percentage change in sales in any given \u0000scal\nperiod compared to the prior \u0000scal period for all stores in that brand only when the brand is owned by FAT Brands.\nBecause of acquisitions, new store openings and store closures, the stores open throughout both \u0000scal periods\nbeing compared may be di\u0000erent from period to period.\nConference Call and Webcast\nFAT Brands will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its \u0000scal third quarter 2024 \u0000nancial results today at\n5:00 PM ET. Hosting the conference call and webcast will be Andy Wiederhorn, Chairman of the Board, and Ken\nKuick, Co-Chief Executive O\u0000cer and Chief Financial O\u0000cer.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 1-877-704-4453 from the U.S. or 1-201-389-0920\ninternationally.

Forward-looking statements generally use words such as “expect,” “foresee,” “anticipate,”\n“believe,” “project,” “should,” “estimate,” “will,” “plans,” “forecast,” and similar expressions, and re\u0000ect our\nexpectations concerning the future. Forward-looking statements are subject to signi\u0000cant business, economic and\n4\ncompetitive risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are di\u0000cult to predict and beyond our control,\nwhich could cause our actual results to di\u0000er materially from the results expressed or implied in such forward-\nlooking statements. We refer you to the documents that we \u0000le from time to time with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, such as our reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, for a discussion of these and other risks\nand uncertainties that could cause our actual results to di\u0000er materially from our current expectations and from\nthe forward-looking statements contained in this press release. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-\nlooking statements to re\u0000ect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Measures (Unaudited)\nThis press release includes the non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss.\nEBITDA is de\u0000ned as earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We use the term EBITDA,\nas opposed to income from operations, as it is widely used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to\nevaluate companies in our industry. We believe that EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance\nbecause it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance. EBITDA is not a measure\nof our \u0000nancial performance or liquidity that is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”), and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of \u0000nancial\nperformance or cash \u0000ows from operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in\naccordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA is de\u0000ned as EBITDA (as de\u0000ned above), excluding expenses related to acquisitions, refranchising\nloss, impairment charges, and certain non-recurring or non-cash items that the Company does not believe directly\nre\u0000ect its core operations and may not be indicative of the Company’s recurring business operations.\nAdjusted net loss is a supplemental measure of \u0000nancial performance that is not required by or presented in\naccordance with GAAP. Adjusted net loss is de\u0000ned as net loss plus the impact of adjustments and the tax e\u0000ects of\nsuch adjustments. Adjusted net loss is presented because we believe it helps convey supplemental information to\ninvestors regarding our performance, excluding the impact of special items that a\u0000ect the comparability of results\nin past quarters to expected results in future quarters. Adjusted net loss as presented may not be comparable to\nother similarly titled measures of other companies, and our presentation of adjusted net loss should not be\nconstrued as an inference that our future results will be una\u0000ected by excluded or unusual items. Our\nmanagement uses this non-GAAP \u0000nancial measure to analyze changes in our underlying business from quarter to\nquarter based on comparable \u0000nancial results.\nReconciliations of net loss presented in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss\nare set forth in the tables below.\n5\nInvestor Relations:\nICR\nMichelle Michalski\nir-fatbrands@icrinc.com\n646-277-1224\nMedia Relations:\nErin Mandzik\nemandzik@fatbrands.com\n860-212-6509\nFAT Brands Inc.
