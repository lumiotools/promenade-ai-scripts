(\"Cracker Barrel\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: CBRL) today announced that the preliminary vote count from the Company's proxy solicitor indicates that its shareholders have voted to elect all 10 of Cracker Barrel's recommended nominees to the Company's Board of Directors at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (\"Annual Meeting\"): Carl Berquist, Jody Bilney, Meg Crofton, Gilbert Dávila, John Garratt, Michael Goodwin, Cheryl Henry, Julie Masino, Gisel Ruiz, and Darryl \"Chip\" Wade. Sardar Biglari and Milena Alberti-Perez – who were nominated by entities Mr. Biglari controls and not recommended by the Board – did not receive sufficient shareholder support to be elected.\n\n[ ![Cracker Barrel Old Country Store logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2526402/Cracker_Barrel_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2526402/Cracker_Barrel_Logo.html)\n\nThe Cracker Barrel Board issued the following statement:\n\nWe thank our shareholders for their constructive engagement over the past several months, and their overwhelming support today.\n\nDuring the course of our engagement, we were heartened by how many shareholders understood and expressed support for the strategic imperatives that we are pursuing. We take seriously the trust they've placed in our directors to oversee the continued momentum of the Company's strategic transformation plan. We are encouraged by the early favorable results across our operations as the plan takes hold and remain confident that we are on the right path to return Cracker Barrel to growth and meaningful value creation for all shareholders. We look forward to continuing to engage with the Company's shareholders as we work to ensure Cracker Barrel thrives today, tomorrow, and well into the future.\n\nWe welcome Michael Goodwin to the Board and believe his decades of IT and strategic leadership will prove to be of great value in our boardroom. We also thank Tom Barr, who did not stand for re-election to the Board, for his service to Cracker Barrel's Board for more than 12 years.\n\nThe results announced today are considered preliminary until final results are tabulated and certified by the independent Inspector of Elections. Cracker Barrel will report final results on a Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** Except for specific historical information, certain of the matters discussed in this communication may express or imply projections of items such as revenues or expenditures, statements of plans and objectives or future operations or statements of future economic performance.

(\"Cracker Barrel\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: CBRL) today reminds all shareholders to vote the universal _WHITE_ proxy card \"**FOR ONLY** \" Cracker Barrel's **10 Recommended Director Nominees** to protect the value of their investment; continue the momentum of the Company's strategic transformation plan; and ensure Cracker Barrel remains a beloved and relevant restaurant brand for many years to come.\n\n[ ![Cracker Barrel Old Country Store logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2526402/Cracker_Barrel_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2526402/Cracker_Barrel_Logo.html)\n\nIn casting your vote, Cracker Barrel reminds you that:\n\n**Cracker Barrel's strategic transformation plan is building momentum across operations as demonstrated by our preliminary first quarter FY 2025 results and reaffirmation of our FY 2025 outlook. **Fiscal 2025 is off to a strong start, with early favorable results on our strategic initiatives and comparable store sales and traffic results that outperformed the Casual Dining industry.\n\n**The Board and management team continue to act with urgency in implementing our long-term strategic transformation plan designed to return Cracker Barrel to growth and profitability. **We are carefully pacing the investments that are part of the plan by methodically testing initiatives and scaling the initiatives with the highest demonstrated returns.\n\n**Sardar Biglari continues to misrepresent Cracker Barrel's capital spending plan.** We are NOT spending $600 - $700 million on store remodels over the next three years as Mr. Biglari falsely claims. Our strategic plan contemplates spending $225 - $325 million in incremental capital (i.e., over and above our normal rates of capital spending). Store remodels are only a part of this incremental amount. Other investments include improvements to our technology and highly successful loyalty program in order to drive traffic. \n\n**Carl Berquist and Meg Crofton are change agents for the Board and the business, while also serving as important sources of stability and institutional knowledge. **With Mr. Berquist's support and under Ms. Crofton's leadership as the Chair of the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, over the past 12 months, all five of Cracker Barrel's longest tenured directors will have left the Board; these individuals included the former Board Chair, former Compensation Committee Chair, and former CEO.\n\n**Multiple proxy advisory firms have joined the Company in urging shareholders to \"WITHHOLD\" support for Sardar Biglari and Milena Alberti-Perez. **ISS, Glass Lewis, and Egan Jones all stressed the extremely poor corporate governance history of Mr. Biglari and did not support his candidacy. Additionally, ISS and Egan-Jones both found Ms. Alberti-Perez's ignorance of Cracker Barrel's business and her lack of preparation to become a director to be disqualifying, especially given her lack of relevant industry experience.\n\nWe are confident the Board's **10 Recommended Director Nominees** – **Carl Berquist , Jody Bilney, Meg Crofton, Gilbert Dávila, John Garratt, Michael Goodwin, Cheryl Henry, Julie Masino, Gisel Ruiz, and Darryl \"Chip\" Wade **– are the right ones to ensure Cracker Barrel thrives today, tomorrow and well into the future and that the strategic transformation plan being implemented by the Company's leadership team is the right one to deliver value for ALL shareholders. Our recommended director nominees have the right set of skills to drive this change forward.\n\nThe Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be on November 21, 2024. Shareholders on record as of September 27, 2024, are entitled to vote at the meeting. For more information on how to vote, or for supporting materials and other important information, shareholders can refer to [CrackerBarrelShareholders.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305704-1&h=2725173822&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crackerbarrelshareholders.com%2F&a=CrackerBarrelShareholders.com).\n\n**YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.** Whether or not you plan to virtually attend the Annual Meeting, please take a few minutes now to vote by Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the WHITE proxy card you have received, or sign, date and return the WHITE proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. If you are a beneficial owner or you hold your shares in \"street name,\" please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.

(\"Cracker Barrel\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: CBRL) today reported its preliminary unaudited financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 ended November 1, 2024 and reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 outlook. The Company plans to report final first quarter fiscal 2025 financial results on December 4, 2024.\n\n**_Preliminary First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Highlights_**\n\n  * First quarter total revenue is expected to be approximately $845.1 million. Compared to the prior year first quarter, total revenue increased 2.6%.\n    * Comparable store restaurant sales increased 2.9%, outperforming the Black Box Intelligence Casual Dining Index by approximately 290 basis points.\n    * Comparable store retail sales decreased 1.6%.\n  * GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to be approximately $0.22, and adjusted1 earnings per diluted share are expected to be approximately $0.45.\n  * GAAP net income for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $4.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA1 is expected to be approximately $45.8 million, a 4.3% increase compared to the prior year quarter adjusted EBITDA1 of $43.9 million, or 5.3% of total revenue.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the preliminary first quarter results, Cracker Barrel President and Chief Executive Officer Julie Masino said, \"Our fiscal year is off to a strong start, as our strategic transformation plan continues to take hold and helped deliver financial results that were in line with our expectations. Additionally, we are pleased that our comparable store sales and traffic results outperformed the Casual Dining industry. We are building momentum across our operations, and while we have more work to do, we are encouraged and energized by the early favorable results of our strategic initiatives. We are highly confident that we are on the right path to drive growth and deliver meaningful value creation for our shareholders.\"\n\n**_Fiscal 2025 Outlook_** The Company reaffirmed the outlook provided in its September 19, 2024 press release. The Company continues to expect the following for fiscal 2025: \n\n  * Total revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion\n  * Two new Cracker Barrel stores and 3 to 4 new Maple Street Biscuit Company units\n  * Commodity inflation of 2% to 3% compared to the prior year\n  * Hourly wage inflation of 3% to 4% compared to the prior year\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 of $200 million to $215 million2\n  * Capital expenditures of $160 million to $180 million\n\n\n\nThe Company reminds investors that its outlook reflects a number of assumptions, many of which are outside the Company's control. In particular, uncertainties created by macroeconomic conditions, such as ongoing inflation, low consumer confidence and high interest rates may adversely affect consumer behavior and cause actual results to differ materially from those expected.\n\n**_1_**** _Adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures. For definitions of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP-Basis Operating Results to Non-GAAP Operating Results section of this release._**\n\n**_2_**** _The Company has determined to provide guidance focused on adjusted EBITDA because the Company believes it will be more useful to investors to evaluate the Company's performance prior to the impact of depreciation (given the expected increase in investments and the resulting higher expected depreciation expense), taxes, closure and impairment charges, and other items that management believes are not reflective of the Company's current operations. The Company is not able to reconcile the forward-looking estimate of adjusted EBITDA set forth above to a forward-looking estimate of net income, the most directly comparable estimated measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, without unreasonable efforts because the Company is unable to predict, forecast or determine the probable significance of certain items impacting these estimates, including interest expense, taxes, closure and impairment charges and share-based compensation, with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Accordingly, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP estimate is not provided._**\n\n**_Fiscal 2025 First Quarter Conference Call_** The Company will provide a real-time webcast and rebroadcast of its first quarter earnings conference call on Wednesday, December 4, 2024, beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The live broadcast of Cracker Barrel's quarterly conference call will be available to the public online in the Events and Presentations section on the Company's website at [investor.crackerbarrel.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302672-1&h=2122555152&u=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.crackerbarrel.com%2F&a=investor.crackerbarrel.com) on December 4, 2024 beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

The Company defines adjusted net income as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding, to the extent the following items occurred during the periods presented: (i) impairment charges and store closing costs, (ii) expenses related to the proxy contest in connection with the Company's 2024 annual meeting of shareholders, (iii) expenses related to the Company's CEO transition, (iv) expenses associated with the Company's strategic transformation initiative, (v) a corporate restructuring charge, (vi) an employee benefits policy change, (vii) goodwill impairment charges, and (viii) the related tax impacts of the foregoing. The Company believes excluding these items from its financial results provides investors with an enhanced understanding of the Company's financial results and enhances comparability across periods. The Company calculates adjusted net income margin by dividing adjusted net income by consolidated GAAP revenue.

The Company defines EBITDA as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense and tax expense. The Company further adjusts EBITDA to exclude, to the extent the following items occurred during the periods presented: (i) expenses related to share-based compensation, (ii) impairment charges and store closing costs, (iii) the proxy contest expenses in connection with the Company's 2024 annual meeting of shareholders, (iv) goodwill impairment charges, (v) the Company's CEO transition, (vi) expenses associated with the Company's strategic transformation initiative, (vii) a corporate restructuring charge, and (viii) an employee benefits policy change. The Company calculates EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin by dividing EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by consolidated GAAP revenue. The Company believes that presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (together with related margin figures) provides investors with an enhanced understanding of the Company's operating performance and debt leverage metrics and enhances comparability with the Company's historical results, and that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure, when combined with the primary presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of the Company's operating performance.
