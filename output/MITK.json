In fact, in 2023 check fraud losses surpassed $20 billion, and are expected to be even higher in 2024. With the evolution of technology, fraudsters have been able to leverage increasingly sophisticated methods like AI to create counterfeit checks, alter legitimate checks, and forge signatures. This rapid escalation in check fraud underscores the urgent need for more robust, real-time verification technologies, and Mitek's Check Fraud Defender represents a significant advancement in check fraud detection. \n\nUsing a unique combination of patented imaging science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to analyze checks from all channels in real-time, one customer reported a reduction in losses of $16M after using CFD for a few months. “As transaction fraud tactics become more sophisticated, effective mitigation is essential to safeguard our clients' operations,\" said Ashish Bhatia, VP Product Management, Alogent. \"By integrating Mitek’s Check Fraud Defender with our Unify platform, we provide our bank and credit union partners with advanced AI-driven tools for risk mitigation across all deposit channels, while maintaining a seamless user experience for account holders. This partnership highlights Alogent’s commitment to innovation and our dedication to upholding the highest standards of security and trust in the banking industry.” \n\nThe Alogent and Mitek partnership is one of many anticipated by Mitek as more financial institutions seek assistance in mitigating the scourge of check fraud and ballooning financial losses. “We are thrilled to extend our partnership with Alogent to include detecting check fraud, which has reached unprecedented levels,” commented Kerry Cantley, Vice President Digital Banking at Mitek. “With this partnership, Alogent’s customers will now be able to leverage Mitek's powerful fraud consortium, to quickly detect and prevent fraudulent activities across any channel online, in branch, or ATM.” \n\n**About Mitek Systems, Inc.**\n\nMitek (NASDAQ: MITK) is a global leader in digital access, founded to bridge the physical and digital worlds.

(NASDAQ: MITK) has been named the winner of the prestigious _Best Transaction Fraud Monitoring and Decisioning Innovation_ category in the 2024 Datos Insights’ Fraud & AML Impact Awards. This recognition solidifies Mitek’s position as an industry leader in fraud detection in financial services, particularly for its groundbreaking product, [Check Fraud Defender](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.miteksystems.com%2Fcheck-fraud-defender&esheet=54111521&newsitemid=20240820453648&lan=en-US&anchor=Check+Fraud+Defender&index=1&md5=f83fc46fc40a6be16e6a7acb2d3eaf6c)TM (CFD). \n\nThis press release features multimedia.

CFD sets new industry standards by employing advanced computer vision and AI technology to meticulously analyze over 24 unique check attributes. This results in unparalleled accuracy that far outstrips traditional methods. \n\nThe power behind CFD’s success lies in its cloud-hosted consortium, which enables fraud analysts to compare check attributes against a vast repository of check profiles from participating banks. In addition to these superior detection capabilities, CFD’s integration with MiVIP’s fraud management console has dramatically reduced bank agent review times from up to 10 minutes to an astounding 90 seconds. This fortifies defenses and streamlines the decision-making process, leading to faster, more accurate fraud detection. \n\n“Check fraud continues to be a significant challenge for FIs, with many traditional detection methods struggling to keep pace with evolving fraud tactics,” notes David Barnhardt, a Fraud & AML Strategic Advisor at Datos Insights. “Mitek Systems’ Check Fraud Defender addresses this industry problem by combining advanced AI and computer-vision technologies with a comprehensive cross-institutional data consortium.” \n\n“We are thrilled to receive this honor from Datos Insights,” said Michael Diamond, General Manager and SVP, Digital Banking Solutions. “This award is a testament to our relentless drive to innovate and protect our customers from the ever-evolving landscape of financial fraud. CFD represents the future of check fraud prevention, delivering the speed, accuracy, and adaptability that today’s financial institutions demand.” \n\nThis award underscores Miteks’ unwavering dedication to advancing fraud prevention technology and reaffirms the company’s role as a trusted partner for financial institutions worldwide. \n\n**About Mitek**\n\nMitek (NASDAQ: MITK) is a global leader in digital access, founded to bridge the physical and digital worlds.

(NASDAQ: MITK, [www.miteksystems.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.miteksystems.com%2F&esheet=54106759&newsitemid=20240808303098&lan=en-US&anchor=www.miteksystems.com&index=1&md5=5c85397d6aa0002a9ca6296b398b7b57), “Mitek” or the “Company”), a global leader in digital identity and fraud prevention, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended June 30, 2024 and revised its previously provided guidance for its 2024 fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. \n\n**Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Total revenue** was $45.0 million, compared to $43.1 million a year ago, or 4% year-over-year growth. \n  * **GAAP operating income** was $0.7 million, an operating margin of 2%, compared to GAAP operating income of $1.8 million, an operating margin of 4% a year ago. \n  * **GAAP net income** was $0.2 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share a year ago. \n  * **Non-GAAP operating income** was $11.6 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 26%, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $12.0 million and a non-GAAP operating margin of 28% a year ago. \n  * **Non-GAAP net income** increased 27% to $12.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $9.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share a year ago. \n  * **Cash flow from operations** was $13.0 million, compared to $16.6 million a year ago. \n  * **Total cash and investments** was $133.2 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of $2.9 million from $130.3 million at March 31, 2024. \n  * Mitek repurchased 819,623 shares at an average per share price of $12.25, totaling approximately $10.0 million. \n\n\n\n**Mitek Executive Chairman and Interim CEO Scott Carter’s Comments**\n\n“While we grew total revenue 4% year over year with Deposits leading the way, I am disappointed in our fiscal Q3 Identity product revenue and revenue outlook for fiscal year 2024. Although we had challenges in Identity, which we are addressing, I remain confident that our superior technology, strategic investments and upcoming product launches position us well to drive growth and deliver long-term shareholder value.” \n\n**Fiscal 2024 Full Year Guidance**\n\nMitek is revising its previously provided guidance for its fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, as follows: \n\n  * Mitek now expects full-year revenue to be between $169 million and $173 million, a decrease of 1% at the midpoint of the range when compared to last year’s revenue. In fiscal 2023, Mitek signed a large multi-year mobile deposit reorder with one customer that locked in favorable pricing over a four-year period. Due to the unique terms of this contract, Mitek recognized additional license revenue relating to future years of approximately $7 million in fiscal 2023. If the Company backs out the future year revenue of approximately $7 million from its fiscal 2023 revenue and attributes the approximately $2.7 million that would have been attributable to fiscal 2024 to the midpoint of the fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, the Company estimates that it would represent growth of approximately 5% at the midpoint. \n  * Mitek now expects its Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2024 to be between 23% and 25%. If the Company adjusts for the impact of the $7 million revenue item as described above, the Company estimates that it would represent a Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 25% at the midpoint. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nMitek management will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the Company’s financial results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks related to the Company’s ability to withstand negative conditions in the global economy, a lack of demand for or market acceptance of the Company’s products, the impact of the Company’s acquisition of HooYu Ltd. including any operational or cultural difficulties associated with the integration of the businesses of Mitek and HooYu Ltd., the Company’s ability to continue to develop, produce and introduce innovative new products in a timely manner, the Company’s ability to capitalize on a growing market, quarterly variations in revenue, the profitability of certain sectors of the Company, the performance of the Company’s growth initiatives, the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation, and the timing of the implementation and launch of the Company’s products by the Company’s signed customers. \n\nAdditional risks and uncertainties faced by the Company are contained from time to time in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including, but not limited to, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 19, 2024 and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you may obtain for free on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.miteksystems.com%2Fblog&esheet=54106759&newsitemid=20240808303098&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=7&md5=fe72f9b147757f5942a3829dfc0450a1). Collectively, these risks and uncertainties could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in its forward-looking statements and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update, amend or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. \n\n**Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis news release contains non-U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures for non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating expense that exclude acquisition-related costs and expenses, litigation and other legal costs, executive transition costs, stock compensation expense, non-recurring audit fees, enterprise risk, portfolio positioning and other related costs, restructuring costs and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. These financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In evaluating the Company’s performance, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial statements prepared under GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Further, management and the Board of Directors of the Company utilize these non-GAAP financial measures to gain a better understanding of the Company’s comparative operating performance from period-to-period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial statements, are useful to investors because they provide a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operating results, including results of operations against investor and analyst financial models, which helps identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and provides a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business. \n\nThe Company has not provided a reconciliation of its forward outlook for non-GAAP operating margin with its forward-looking GAAP operating margin in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to quantify share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from our non-GAAP operating margin, as it requires additional inputs such as the number of shares granted and market prices that are not ascertainable due to the volatility of the Company’s share price. Additionally, a significant portion of the Company’s operations are in foreign countries and the transactional currencies are primarily Euros and British pound sterling and the Company is not able to predict fluctuations in those currencies without unreasonable efforts. \n\n**MITEK SYSTEMS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**(amounts in thousands except share

Restructuring costs were $2.0 million in the nine months ended June 30, 2023 and were related to a restructuring plan that was initially implemented in June and November 2022.   \n(5)  |  The Company’s non-GAAP net income is calculated using a cash tax rate of 13% in fiscal 2024 and 23% in fiscal 2023. The estimated cash tax rate is the estimated annual tax payable on the Company’s tax returns as a percentage of estimated annual non-GAAP pre-tax net income. The Company uses an estimated cash tax rate to adjust for the historical variation in the effective book tax rate associated with the reversal of valuation allowances, and the utilization of research and development tax credits which currently have an overall effect of reducing taxes payable. The Company believes that the cash tax rate provides a more transparent view of the Company’s operating results. The Company’s effective tax rate used for the purposes of calculating GAAP net income for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was 35% and 32%, respectively.   \n**MITEK SYSTEMS, INC.** **NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME RECONCILIATION** **(Unaudited)** **(amounts in thousands)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended June 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nGAAP operating income  |  $  |  734  |  $  |  1,792  |  $  |  (5,484  |  )  |  $  |  18,851   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nAcquisition-related costs and expenses  |  3,749  |  6,207  |  11,581  |  15,302   \nLitigation and other legal costs  |  157  |  393  |  3,244  |  1,119   \nExecutive transition costs  |  1,265  |  91  |  2,033  |  672   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  3,585  |  2,644  |  10,901  |  7,790   \nNon-recurring audit fees  |  1,014  |  812  |  5,025  |  2,185   \nEnterprise risk, portfolio positioning and other related costs  |  —  |  —  |  996  |  —   \nRestructuring costs  |  1,070  |  14  |  1,648  |  2,000   \nNon-GAAP operating income  |  $  |  11,574  |  $  |  11,953  |  $  |  29,944  |  $  |  47,919   \nTotal Revenue  |  $  |  44,976  |  $  |  43,070  |  $  |  128,861  |  $  |  134,896   \nNon-GAAP operating margin  |  26  |  %  |  28  |  %  |  23  |  %  |  36  |  %   \n**MITEK SYSTEMS, INC.**  \n---  \n**SUPPLEMENTAL RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP ACTUALS TO NON-GAAP ACTUALS**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**(amounts in thousands)**  \n**Three Months Ended June 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nSelling and marketing  |  $  |  10,354  |  $  |  10,296  |  $  |  31,231  |  $  |  29,434   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  818  |  885  |  2,579  |  2,423   \nNon-GAAP Selling and marketing  |  $  |  9,536  |  $  |  9,411  |  $  |  28,652  |  $  |  27,011   \nResearch and development  |  $  |  9,982  |  $  |  7,461  |  $  |  28,569  |  $  |  22,504   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  1,344  |  644  |  3,751  |  2,097   \nNon-GAAP Research and development  |  $  |  8,638  |  $  |  6,817  |  $  |  24,818  |  $  |  20,407   \nGeneral and administrative  |  $  |  12,604  |  $  |  11,588  |  $  |  43,085  |  $  |  30,126   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  1,229  |  991  |  4,124  |  2,954   \nLitigation and other legal costs  |  157  |  393  |  3,244  |  1,119   \nExecutive transition costs  |  1,265  |  91  |  2,033  |  672   \nNon-recurring audit fees  |  1,014  |  812  |  5,025  |  2,185   \nEnterprise risk, portfolio positioning and other related costs  |  —  |  —  |  996  |  —   \nNon-GAAP General and administrative  |  $  |  8,939  |  $  |  9,301  |  $  |  27,663  |  $  |  23,196   \nTotal Non-GAAP Operating Expense  |  $  |  27,113  |  $  |  25,529  |  $  |  81,133  |  $  |  70,614   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240808303098r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240808303098/en/>\n\n**Investor Contact:** Todd Kehrli or Jim Byers MKR Investor Relations, Inc. mitk@mkr-group.com\n\nSource: Mitek Systems, Inc.\n\n![](https://match.prod.bidr.io/cookie-sync/demandbase)![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n"

(NASDAQ: MITK), a global leader in digital identity verification, mobile capture and fraud management, today announced the appointment of James (“J.D.”) Fay to its board of directors. Mr. Fay will also serve as a member of the board’s audit committee. Mr. Fay, who currently serves as Chief Financial Officer at Matterport, Inc. (NASDAQ: MTTR), brings over two decades of financial strategy and operational expertise to Mitek, having played a key role in scaling technology companies from early growth stages to IPO and acquisition. \n\n“We are thrilled to welcome J.D. to our board and believe his extensive experience in financial strategy and guiding companies through growth and transformation will be critical as we continue to execute our long-term vision,” said Scott Carter, Chairman of Mitek Systems. \n\nAt Matterport, Mr. Fay has overseen the company’s financial operations since 2017, during which time the company has nearly quadrupled its revenues. He guided Matterport through its successful acquisition agreement with CoStar Group, representing a premium of over 200%, and his leadership in transitioning the company from a hardware to a recurring revenue SaaS model is expected to bring valuable insights to Mitek as the company focuses on scaling its recurring revenue streams and strengthening its market positioning. Mr. Fay has more than twenty years of experience as a globally focused senior executive, lawyer, and advisor for venture-backed and public technology companies, and he has structured and led IPOs on the NYSE and Nasdaq and managed strategic acquisitions across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. \n\nPrior to Matterport, Mr. Fay served as Chief Financial Officer at View, managing financial, legal, HR, and operations matters while the company was privately held. He also served as Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel at NeoPhotonics (NYSE: NPTN; acquired by Lumentum Holdings) and Senior Vice President and General Counsel at @Road (NASDAQ: ATRD; acquired by Trimble), taking both companies public on the NYSE and Nasdaq, respectively. Mr. Fay holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School and previously worked as an attorney at Venture Law Group, advising public and private tech companies on IPOs, M&A, and corporate matters. His experience adds extensive corporate governance and legal expertise to the Mitek board. \n\n“Mitek is at an exciting inflection point in its growth, and I am honored to join the board at this important period,” said Mr. Fay. “I look forward to leveraging my experience to help shape the company’s future and drive strategic initiatives that create significant value for both customers and shareholders.” \n\nMr. Fay’s appointment follows the [recent announcement](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.miteksystems.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fmitek-ceo-announcement&esheet=54140609&newsitemid=20241022130801&lan=en-US&anchor=recent+announcement&index=1&md5=381efc9172c421696f8f7f2526a917b7) of Edward H. West as Mitek’s new CEO, further solidifying the company’s commitment to building a strong leadership team that will drive its next phase of growth. \n\nSeparately, Mitek announced that James C. Hale has notified the company that he will not stand for reelection at the company’s annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2025. “We would like to thank Jim for his decade of service to Mitek. His leadership and insight have been instrumental in Mitek’s evolution. We wish him all the best in the future,” said Mr. Carter. \n\n**About Mitek**\n\nMitek (NASDAQ: MITK) is a global leader in digital access, founded to bridge the physical and digital worlds.

(NASDAQ: MITK), a global leader in digital identity verification, mobile capture, and fraud management solutions, announced today it granted equity awards as a material inducement to the employment of the company’s newly-hired Chief Executive Officer, Edward H. West. \n\nThe overarching philosophy in the design of Mr. West’s compensation package was an emphasis on equity-based compensation directly tied to building stockholder value in lieu of significant guaranteed cash and/or service-based equity. To this end, in connection with Mr. West’s appointment as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, its Board and Compensation Committee approved employment inducement awards for Mr. West with a grant date fair value of $8,000,000. These awards are heavily weighted towards performance based vesting requirements with $6,375,000 of the value in the form of at-target performance-vesting restricted stock units (“PSUs”) and the remaining $1,625,000 in the form of service-based vesting restricted stock units (“RSUs”). \n\nThe awards consist of (i) 562,283 PSUs that may vest, if at all, upon the achievement of target-level stock price performance goals of the Company compared to the Russell 2000 (with an additional 185,553 PSUs eligible to vest upon the achievement of above-target level performance), (ii) 173,010 PSUs that may vest, if at all, upon the achievement of target-level direct stock price improvement performance goals of the Company (with an additional 57,093 PSUs eligible to vest upon the achievement of above-target level performance) and (iii) 187,427 RSUs that vest in four equal annual installments from the start date. In each case, vesting of the PSUs and RSUs is subject to Mr. West’s continuous employment through the applicable vesting date or earlier vesting due to a change of control and certain termination events. \n\nThe PSUs and RSUs are intended to be inducement awards under Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and were granted outside of the Company’s Amended and Restated 2020 Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Although the PSUs and RSUs were granted as inducement awards outside of the Plan, the PSUs and RSUs are subject to the terms of the Plan. \n\n**About Mitek:**\n\nMitek (NASDAQ: MITK) is a global leader in digital access, founded to bridge the physical and digital worlds. Mitek’s advanced identity verification technologies and global platform make digital access faster and more secure than ever, providing companies new levels of control, deployment ease and operation, while protecting the entire customer journey.
