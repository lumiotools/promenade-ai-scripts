The company is currently developing DA-1726 for the treatment of obesity and DA-1241 for the treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH).\n\nDA-1726 is a novel, dual oxyntomodulin (OXM) analog agonist that functions as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and glucagon receptor (GCGR), for once-a-week injection. OXM is a naturally-occurring gut hormone that activates GLP1R and GCGR, thereby decreasing food intake while increasing energy expenditure, potentially resulting in superior body weight loss compared to selective GLP1R agonists.\n\nDA-1241 is a novel G-protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119) agonist that promotes the release of key gut peptides GLP-1, GIP, and PYY. In pre-clinical studies, DA-1241 demonstrated a positive effect on liver inflammation, lipid metabolism, weight loss, and glucose metabolism, reducing hepatic steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and liver fibrosis, while also improving glucose control.\n\nOur strategic partner and the largest investor, Dong-A ST Co. Ltd., is part of the Dong-A Socio Group of companies established in 1932 and based in South Korea. MetaVia has the full support of Dong-A ST’s Research Center, providing the company with access to R&D, scientific and CMC expertise.\n\n## [Clinical Pipeline & Technology](/clinical-pipeline-technology \"Clinical Pipeline & Technology\")\n\n## [Investors](/investor-overview \"Main Investor Relations Page\")\n\n## [News Releases](/press-releases \"News Releases\")\n\n[**Print**](javascript:window.print\\(\\); \"Print Page\")\n\n[**RSS Feeds** ](/rss-feeds \"RSS Feeds\")\n\n[**E-mail Alerts** ](/email-alerts \"E-mail Alerts\")\n\n[**IR Contacts** ](/ir-contact \"IR Contacts\")\n"

The company is currently developing DA-1726 for the treatment of obesity and DA-1241 for the treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH).\n\nDA-1726 is a novel, dual oxyntomodulin (OXM) analog agonist that functions as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and glucagon receptor (GCGR), for once-a-week injection. OXM is a naturally-occurring gut hormone that activates GLP1R and GCGR, thereby decreasing food intake while increasing energy expenditure, potentially resulting in superior body weight loss compared to selective GLP1R agonists.\n\nDA-1241 is a novel G-protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119) agonist that promotes the release of key gut peptides GLP-1, GIP, and PYY. In pre-clinical studies, DA-1241 demonstrated a positive effect on liver inflammation, lipid metabolism, weight loss, and glucose metabolism, reducing hepatic steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and liver fibrosis, while also improving glucose control.\n\nOur strategic partner and the largest investor, Dong-A ST Co. Ltd., is part of the Dong-A Socio Group of companies established in 1932 and based in South Korea. MetaVia has the full support of Dong-A ST’s Research Center, providing the company with access to R&D, scientific and CMC expertise.\n\n## [Clinical Pipeline & Technology](/clinical-pipeline-technology \"Clinical Pipeline & Technology\")\n\n## [Investors](/investor-overview \"Main Investor Relations Page\")\n\n## [News Releases](/press-releases \"News Releases\")\n\n[**Print**](javascript:window.print\\(\\); \"Print Page\")\n\n[**RSS Feeds** ](/rss-feeds \"RSS Feeds\")\n\n[**E-mail Alerts** ](/email-alerts \"E-mail Alerts\")\n\n[**IR Contacts** ](/ir-contact \"IR Contacts\")\n"
