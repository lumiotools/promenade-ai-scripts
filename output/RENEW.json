All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “may,” “plan”\nand “will” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current plans, estimates and expectations and are inherently uncertain. The inclusion of any forward-looking\ninformation in this presentation should not be regarded as a representation that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and\nassumptions. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, global and domestic market and business conditions, successful execution of\nbusiness and growth strategies and regulatory factors relevant to our business, as well as assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity and the risks and\nuncertainties described in greater detail under “Risk Factors” included in Cartesian's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscalyear ended December 31, 2021, Cartesian's Form S-4 originally filed February 11, 2022, and in our\nsubsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as such factors may be updated from time to time. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nFinancial Information\nThe financial information and data contained in this Presentation is unaudited and does not conform to Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act. Accordingly, such information and data may not be included in, may be\nadjusted in or may be presented differently in, any registration statement that may be filed in connection with the Business Combination.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures contained in this presentation (including, without limitation, Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Net Income (on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis), Adjusted Net Income per share, Fee-Related Earnings\nand Fee-Related Earnings Margin) are not GAAP measures of the Company’s financial performance or liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash flows\nfrom operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure is included on page 44 of\nthis presentation. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment to non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons management considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. Cartesian and the Companies believe that the use\nof these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends.

          "content": "Exhibit 14\nCODE OF ETHICS\nOF\nCARTESIAN GROWTH CORPORATION\n1. Introduction\nThe board of directors (the “Board”) of Cartesian Growth Corporation (the “Company”) has adopted this code of\nethics (this “Code”), as amended from time to time by the Board and which is applicable to all directors, officers and\nemployees of the Company, with the intent to:\n● promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of\ninterest between personal and professional relationships;\n● promote the full, fair, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the\nCompany files with, or submits to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as\nwell as in other public communications made by or on behalf of the Company;\n● promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n● deter wrongdoing; and\n● require prompt internal reporting of violations of, and accountability for adherence to, this Code.\nThis Code may be amended or modified only by resolution of the Board. In this Code, references to the “Company”\ninclude, in appropriate context, the Company’s subsidiaries, if any.\n2. Honest, Ethical and Fair Conduct\nEach person owes a duty to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest,\nfair and candid. Deceit, dishonesty and subordination of the Company’s interest to personal interest are inconsistent\nwith integrity. Service to the Company should never be subordinated to personal gain or advantage.\nEach person must:\n● Act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still maintaining the confidentiality of\nthe Company’s information where required or when in the Company’s interests.\n● Observe all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.\n● Comply with the requirements of applicable accounting and auditing standards, as well as Company\npolicies, in order to maintain a high standard of accuracy and completeness in the Company’s\nfinancial records and other business-related information and data.\n● Adhere to a high standard of business ethics and not seek competitive advantage through unlawful\nor unethical business practices.\n● Deal fairly with the Company’s customers, suppliers, competitors, employees and independent\ncontractors.\n● Refrain from taking advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged\ninformation, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.\n● Protect the assets of the Company and ensure their proper use.\n● Refrain from taking for themselves personally opportunities that are discovered through the use of\ncorporate assets or using corporate assets, information or position for general personal gain outside\nthe scope of employment with the Company.\n● Avoid conflicts of interest, wherever possible, except as may be permitted under guidelines or\nresolutions approved by the Board (or the appropriate committee of the Board). Anything that\nwould be a conflict for a person subject to this Code also will be a conflict for a member of his or\nher immediate family or a close relative. Examples of conflict of interest situations include, but are\nnot limited to, the following (all of which must be disclosed to the Company):\no any significant ownership interest in any supplier or customer;\no any consulting or employment relationship with any customer, supplier or competitor;\no any outside business activity that detracts from an individual’s ability to devote appropriate\ntime and attention to his or her responsibilities with the Company;\no the receipt of any money, non-nominal gifts or excessive entertainment from any company\nwith which the Company has current or prospective business dealings;\no being in the position of supervising, reviewing or having any influence on the job\nevaluation, pay or benefit of any close relative;\no selling anything to the Company or buying anything from the Company, except on the\nsame terms and conditions as comparable officers or directors are permitted to so purchase\nor sell (and, in the absence of any such comparable officer or director, on the same terms\nand conditions as a third party would buy or sell a comparable item in an arm’s-length\ntransaction); and\no any other circumstance, event, relationship or situation in which the personal interest of a\nperson subject to this Code interferes – or even appears to interfere – with the interests of\nthe Company as a whole.\n3. Disclosure\nThe Company strives to ensure that the contents of and the disclosures in public communications and in the reports\nand documents that the Company files with the SEC shall be full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable in\naccordance with applicable disclosure standards, including standards of materiality, where appropriate. Each person\nmust:\n● not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others,\nwhether within or outside the Company, including to the Company’s independent registered public\naccountants, governmental regulators, self-regulating organizations and other governmental\nofficials, as appropriate; and\n● in relation to his or her area of responsibility, properly review and critically analyze proposed\ndisclosure for accuracy and completeness.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (or persons performing similar\nfunctions) of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company, if any, and each other person that typically is involved\nin the financial reporting of the Company must familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements\napplicable to the Company as well as the business and financial operations of the Company.\nEach person must promptly bring to the attention of the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit\nCommittee”) (or the Chairman of the Board if no Audit Committee exists) any information he or she may have\nconcerning (a) significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal and/or disclosure controls which could\nadversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data or (b) any fraud,\nwhether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company’s\nfinancial reporting, disclosures or internal controls.\n2\n4. Compliance\nIt is the Company’s obligation and policy to comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. It\nis the personal responsibility of each person to, and each person must, adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed\nby those laws, rules, and regulations, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters.\n5. Reporting and Accountability\nThe Board or Audit Committee, if one exists, is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which\nquestions are presented to it and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. Any person who\nbecomes aware of any existing or potential breach of this Code is required to notify the Chairman of the Board or\nAudit Committee promptly. Failure to do so is itself a breach of this Code.\nSpecifically, each person must:\n● Notify the Chairman of the Board promptly of any existing or potential violation of this Code.\n● Not retaliate against any other person for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith.\nThe Company will follow the following procedures in investigating and enforcing this Code and in reporting on this\nCode:\n● The Board or Audit Committee, if one exists, will take all appropriate action to investigate any\npotential or actual breaches reported to it.\n● If the Audit Committee, if one exists, determines (by majority decision) that a breach has occurred,\nit will inform the Board.\n● Upon a determination by the Board that a breach has occurred, the Board (by majority decision) will\ntake or authorize such disciplinary or preventive action as it deems appropriate, after consultation\nwith the Audit Committee, if one exists, and/or the Company’s internal or external legal counsel,\nup to and including dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other serious violations of law,\nnotification of the SEC or other appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nNo person following the above procedure shall, as a result of following such procedure, be subject by the Company\nor any officer or employee thereof to discharge, demotion, suspension, threat, harassment or, in any manner,\ndiscrimination, against such person in terms and conditions of employment.\n6. Waivers and Amendments\nAny waiver (defined below) or an implicit waiver (defined below) from a provision of this Code for the principal\nexecutive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar\nfunctions or any amendment (as defined below) to this Code is required to be disclosed in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K or in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.\nA “waiver” means the approval by the Board of a material departure from a provision of this Code. An “implicit\nwaiver” means the Company’s failure to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure\nfrom a provision of this Code that has been made known to an executive officer of the Company. An “amendment”\nmeans any amendment to this Code other than minor technical, administrative or other non-substantive amendments\nhereto.\nAll persons should note that it is not the Company’s intention to grant or to permit waivers from the requirements of\nthis Code. The Company expects full compliance with this Code.\n7. Insider Information and Securities Trading\nThe Company’s directors, officers or employees who have access to material, non-public information are not permitted\nto use that information for securities trading purposes or for any purpose unrelated to the Company’s business. It is\n3\nalso against the law to trade or to “tip” others who might make an investment decision based on material, non-public\ninformation. For example, using material, non-public information to buy or sell the Company securities, options in\nthe Company securities or the securities of any Company supplier, customer, competitor, potential business partner or\npotential target is prohibited. The consequences of insider trading violations can be severe. These rules also apply to\nthe use of material, nonpublic information about other companies (including, for example, the Company’s customers,\ncompetitors, potential business partners and potential targets). In addition to directors, officers or employees, these\nrules apply to such person’s spouse, children, parents and siblings, as well as any other family members living in such\nperson’s home.\n8. Financial Statements and Other Records\nAll of the Company’s books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable detail, must\nappropriately reflect the Company’s transactions and must both conform to applicable legal requirements and to the\nCompany’s system of internal controls. Unrecorded or “off the books” funds or assets should not be maintained unless\npermitted by applicable law or regulation.\nRecords should always be retained or destroyed according to the Company’s record retention policies. In accordance\nwith those policies, in the event of litigation or governmental investigation, please consult the Board or the Company’s\ninternal or external legal counsel.\n9. Improper Influence on Conduct of Audits\nNo director or officer, or any other person acting under the direction thereof, shall directly or indirectly take any action\nto coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence any public or certified public accountant engaged in the\nperformance of an audit or review of the financial statements of the Company or take any action that such person\nknows or should know that if successful could result in rendering the Company’s financial statements materially\nmisleading. Any person who believes such improper influence is being exerted should report such action to such\nperson’s supervisor, or if that is impractical under the circumstances, to any of the Company’s directors.\nTypes of conduct that could constitute improper influence include, but are not limited to, directly or indirectly:\n• Offering or paying bribes or other financial incentives, including future employment or contracts\nfor non-audit services.\n• Providing an auditor with an inaccurate or misleading legal analysis.\n• Threatening to cancel or canceling existing non-audit or audit engagements if the auditor objects to\nthe Company’s accounting.\n• Seeking to have a partner removed from the audit engagement because the partner objects to the\nCompany’s accounting.\n• Blackmailing.\n• Making physical threats.\n10. Anti-Corruption Laws\nThe Company complies with the anti-corruption laws of the countries in which it does business, including the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“FCPA”). Directors, officers, employees and agents, such as\nthird-party sales representatives, shall not take or cause to be taken any action that would reasonably result in the\nCompany not complying with such anti-corruption laws, including FCPA. If you are authorized to engage agents on\nthe Company’s behalf, you are responsible for ensuring they are reputable and for obtaining a written agreement for\nthem to uphold the Company’s standards in this area.\n4\n11. Violations\nViolation of this Code is grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Such\naction is in addition to any civil or criminal liability which might be imposed by any court or regulatory agency.\n12. Other Policies and Procedures\nAny other policy or procedure set out by the Company in writing or made generally known to employees, officers or\ndirectors of the Company prior to the date hereof or hereafter are separate requirements and remain in full force and\neffect.\n13. Inquiries\nAll inquiries and questions in relation to this Code or its applicability to particular people or situations should be\naddressed to the Company’s Secretary, or such other compliance officer as shall be designated from time to time by\nthe Company.\n5\nPROVISIONS FOR\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS\nThe Chief Executive Officer and all senior financial officers, including the Chief Financial Officer and principal\naccounting officer, are bound by the provisions set forth herein relating to ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, and\ncompliance with law. In addition to this Code, the Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers are subject to\nthe following additional specific policies:\n1. Act with honesty and integrity, avoiding actual or apparent conflicts between personal, private\ninterests and the interests of the Company, including receiving improper personal benefits as a result of his or her\nposition.\n2. Disclose to the Chief Executive Officer and the Board any material transaction or relationship that\nreasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest.\n3. Perform responsibilities with a view to causing periodic reports and documents filed with or\nsubmitted to the SEC and all other public communications made by the Company to contain information that is\naccurate, complete, fair, objective, relevant, timely and understandable, including full review of all annual and\nquarterly reports.\n4.

PURPOSE\nThe Audit Committee (the “Committee”) is a committee of the board of directors (the “Board”) of Cartesian\nGrowth Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Company”). The Committee shall provide\nassistance to the Board in fulfilling its legal and fiduciary obligations to oversee:\n(a) the integrity of the financial statements and other financial information provided by the Company\nto its shareholders, the public, any stock exchange and others;\n(b) the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n(c) the qualifications and independence of the Company’s independent auditor;\n(d) the performance of the Company’s internal audit function and its system of internal controls and\nindependent auditor; and\n(e) such other matters as are assigned to the Committee by the Board pursuant to this Charter or as\nmandated under applicable laws, rules and regulations (including the U.S. Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the “Exchange Act”))\nas well as listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market (together, the “Applicable\nRequirements”).\nAlthough the Committee has the powers and responsibilities set forth in this Charter, the role of the\nCommittee is oversight. The members of the Committee are not full-time employees of the Company and may or may\nnot be accountants or auditors by profession or experts in the fields of accounting or auditing and, in any event, do not\nserve in such capacity. Consequently, it is not the duty of the Committee to conduct audits or to determine that the\nCompany’s financial statements and disclosures are complete and accurate and are in accordance with U.S. Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and other Applicable Requirements. These are the responsibilities of\nmanagement and the Company’s independent auditor\n2. ORGANIZATION\nThe Committee shall be comprised of three or more directors (as determined from time to time by the Board),\neach of whom shall meet the independence, financial literacy, and other qualification requirements Section 10A-3 of\nthe Exchange Act and any other Applicable Requirements, subject to any phase-in periods or cure periods permitted\nby Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(iv)(A) under the Exchange Act and other Applicable Requirements. At least one member of the\nCommittee shall be an “audit committee financial expert” (as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “Commission”)).
