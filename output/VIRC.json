CORPORATION CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS FOR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES\n\n  * Purpose\n  * Introduction\n  * Integrity of Records and Public Reporting\n  * Conflict of Interest\n  * Corporate Opportunities\n  * Confidentiality\n  * Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\n  * Reporting Illegal or Unethical Behavior\n  * Waivers\n\n\n\n### PURPOSE\n\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Virco Mfg. Corporation (the “Company”) has adopted the following Code of Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) to apply to the Company’s directors, officers and employees. This Code is intended to focus directors, officers and employees on areas of ethical risk, provide guidance to help them recognize and deal with ethical issues, provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct, foster a culture of honesty and accountability, deter wrongdoing and promote fair and accurate disclosure and financial reporting.\n\nThis Code is a product of the Company’s corporate values, which are Voice, Dignity, Fairness, Leadership and Merit. These values direct the management of our Company. They also direct personal interactions with other employees, stockholders, customers, suppliers and competitors. We believe everyone is entitled to express their ideas: this is Voice. We believe everyone deserves to be treated with Dignity. In all activities we will be guided by Fairness. Every employee is expected to show Leadership in promoting the Company values. Finally, all activities and decisions will be evaluated on the basis of Merit. Upholding these values makes Virco a good place to work. All employees are expected to adhere to the Company’s corporate values as described in the employee handbook. This Code supplements, but does not supersede that obligation.\n\nNo code or policy can anticipate every situation that may arise. Accordingly, this Code is intended to serve as a source of guiding principles. Employees are encouraged to bring questions about particular circumstances that may involve one or more of the provisions of this Code to the attention of their supervisors. Directors and officers should bring any such questions to the Chair of the Audit Committee, who may consult with inside or outside legal counsel as appropriate.\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\nEach director, officer and employee is expected to adhere to a high standard of ethical conduct. The good name of the Company depends on the way directors, officers and employees conduct business and the way the public perceives that conduct. Unethical actions, or the appearance of unethical actions, are not acceptable. Directors, officers and employees are expected to be guided by the following principles in carrying out their responsibilities:\n\n  * Loyalty. Directors, officers and employees should not be, or appear to be, subject to influences, interests or relationships that conflict with the interests of the Company.\n  * Compliance with Applicable Laws. Directors, officers and employees are expected to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company’s activities.\n  * Observance of Ethical Standards. Directors, officers and employees must adhere to high ethical standards in the conduct of their duties. These include honesty and fairness.\n\n\n\n### INTEGRITY OF RECORDS AND PUBLIC REPORTING\n\nDirectors, officers and employees must avoid any conflicts of interest between themselves and the Company. Any situation that involves, or may involve, a conflict of interest with the Company, should be disclosed promptly. Employees should bring the conflict of interest to the attention of their supervisor. Directors and officers should bring the conflict of interest to the attention of the Chair of the Audit Committee, who may consult with inside or outside legal counsel as appropriate.\n\n### CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nA “conflict of interest” can occur when an individual’s personal interest is adverse to – or appears to be adverse to – the interests of the Company. Conflicts of interest also can arise when an individual, or a member of his or her immediate family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company. “Immediate family” includes a person’s spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers and fathers-in-law, sons and daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law and anyone who shares such person’s home.\n\nA “conflict of interest” can occur when an individual’s personal interest is adverse to – or appears to be adverse to – the interests of the Company. Conflicts of interest also can arise when an individual, or a member of his or her immediate family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company. “Immediate family” includes a person’s spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers and fathers-in-law, sons and daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law and anyone who shares such person’s home.\n\nThis Code does not attempt to describe all possible conflicts of interest that could develop. Some of the more common conflicts from which directors, officers and employees must refrain, however, are set forth below.\n\n  * Improper conduct and activities. Directors, officers and employees may not engage in any conduct or activity that is inconsistent with the Company’s interests or that disrupts or impairs the Company’s relationship with any person or entity with which the Company has or proposes to enter into a business or contractual relationship.\n  * Compensation from non-Company sources. Directors, officers and employees may not accept compensation (in any form) for services performed for the Company from any source other than the Company.\n  * Gifts. Directors, officers and employees and members of their immediate families may not accept gifts from persons or entities where any such gift is being made in order to influence their actions in their position with the Company, or where acceptance of the gift could create the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n  * Personal use of Company assets. Directors and officers may not use Company assets, labor or information for personal use, other than incidental personal use, unless approved by the Chair of the Audit Committee or as part of a compensation or expense reimbursement program. Employees may not use Company assets, labor or information for personal use, other than incidental personal use, unless approved by their supervisor or as part of a compensation or expense reimbursement program.\n\n\n\n### CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES\n\nDirectors, officers and employees are prohibited from: (a) taking for themselves personal opportunities related to the Company’s business; (b) using the Company’s property, information or position for personal gain; or (c) competing with the Company for business opportunities.\n\n### CONFIDENTIALITY\n\nDirectors, officers and employees should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by the Company and any other confidential information about the Company, its business, customers or suppliers, that comes to them, from whatever source, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. For purposes of this Code, “confidential information” includes all non-public information relating to the Company, its business, customers or suppliers.\n\n### COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS\n\nDirectors, officers and employees shall comply with all governmental laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company, including insider trading laws. They also must provide all constituents, including the Securities and Exchange Commission if required, with information that is accurate, complete, objective, relevant, timely and understandable. Transactions in Company securities are governed by the Company’s Stock Trading Window Policy.\n\n### REPORTING ILLEGAL OR UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR\n\nEmployees should communicate any actual or suspected violations of this Code promptly to their supervisors. If an employee has concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters, the employee may submit those concerns to the Audit Committee by calling the Audit Committee Hotline at (844) 775-6641. You may also submit a complaint online at [virco.ethicspoint.com](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/67700/index.html \"http://virco.ethicspoint.com\"). Calls to the Audit Committee Hotline may be made anonymously and will be treated as confidential.\n\nDirectors and officers should communicate any actual or suspected violations of this Code (and any concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters) to the Chair of the Audit Committee.\n\nViolations of this Code will be investigated by the Board of Directors or by a person or persons designated by the Board, and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken in the event of any violations of the Code, up to and including termination. Directors, officers and employees may not be retaliated against for reporting actual or suspected violations of this Code in good faith. If a director, officer or employee believes that he or she has been discharged, disciplined or otherwise penalized for reporting a violation in good faith, he or she should immediately report that belief to the Chair of the Audit Committee\n\n### WAIVERS\n\nAny waivers of this Code for directors and officers must be approved by the Board.\n"

          "content": "Corporate Governance Guidelines\nVIRCO MFG. CORPORATION\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Virco Mfg. Corporation (the “Company”) has\nadopted the following Corporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) to assist the Board in\nthe exercise of its responsibilities and to serve the interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nThese Guidelines should be interpreted in the context of all applicable laws and the Company’s\ncertificate of incorporation, bylaws and other corporate governance documents. These Guidelines\nacknowledge the leadership exercised by the Board’s standing committees and their chairs and are\nintended to serve as a flexible framework within which the Board may conduct its business and\nnot as a set of legally binding obligations. The Guidelines are subject to modification from time\nto time by the Board as the Board may deem appropriate and in the best interests of the Company\nand its stockholders or as required by applicable laws and regulations.\nI. THE BOARD\nA. Independence of the Board\nExcept as otherwise permitted by the applicable NASDAQ rules, the Board will be\ncomprised of a majority of directors who qualify as independent directors (the “Independent\nDirectors”) as required under NASDAQ rules.\nB. Separate Sessions of Independent Directors and Board Committees\nThe Independent Directors will meet in executive session without non-Independent\nDirectors or management present on a regularly scheduled basis, but no less than twice per year.\nThe Board’s standing committees shall hold separate meetings and keep meeting minutes separate\nfrom the Board.\nC. Lead Director\nIf the Chairman of the Board is a member of management or does not otherwise qualify as\nindependent, the Board may elect a lead director. The lead director’s responsibilities include but\nare not limited to: presiding over all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman of the Board is\nnot present, including any executive sessions of the Independent Directors; approving Board\nmeeting schedules and agendas; and acting as the liaison between the Independent Directors and\nthe Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. The Board may modify its leadership\nstructure in the future as it deems appropriate.\nD. Director Qualification Standards and Additional Selection Criteria\nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, in recommending director\ncandidates, and the Board, in nominating director candidates, will evaluate candidates in\naccordance with the qualification standards set forth in Attachment A to these Guidelines. In\naddition, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board may also consider\nVirco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nthe additional selection criteria listed in the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee’s\ncharter.\nE. Director Orientation and Continuing Education\nManagement will provide an orientation process for new directors, including background\nmaterial on the Company and its business. As appropriate, management will provide opportunities\nfor additional educational sessions for directors on matters relevant to the Company and its\nbusiness.\nF. Service on Other Boards\nThe Board does not believe that its members should be prohibited from serving on boards\nof other organizations and has not adopted any guidelines limiting such activities. However, the\nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee may take into account the nature of and time\ninvolved in a director’s service on other boards and/or committees in evaluating the suitability of\nindividual director candidates and current directors. Prior to accepting any position on the board\nof directors of any organization, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, current directors should notify\nthe Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of the Board shall review the proposed board\nmembership to ensure compliance with applicable laws and policies.\nService on other boards and/or committees should be consistent with the Company’s\nconflict of interest policies.\nG. Directors Who Resign or Materially Change Their Current Positions With Their\nOwn Company or Become Aware of Circumstances that May Adversely Reflect\nupon the Director or the Company\nWhen a director, including any director who is currently an officer or employee of the\nCompany, resigns or materially changes his or her position with his or her employer or becomes\naware of circumstances that may adversely reflect upon the director or the Company, such director\nshould notify the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of such circumstances. The\nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider the circumstances, and may in\ncertain cases recommend that the Board request that the director submit his or her resignation from\nthe Board if, for example, continuing service on the Board by the individual is not consistent with\nthe criteria deemed necessary for continuing service on the Board.\nH. Term Limits\nAs each director is periodically subject to election by stockholders, the Board does not\nbelieve it is in the best interests of the Company to establish term limits. Additionally, such term\nlimits may cause the Company to lose the contribution of directors who have been able to develop,\nover a period of time, increasing insight into the Company’s business and therefore can provide\nan increasingly significant contribution to the Board.\n2\nVirco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nI. Director Responsibilities\nThe business and affairs of the Company will be managed by or under the direction of the\nBoard, including through one or more of its committees. Each director is expected to spend the\ntime and effort necessary to properly discharge his or her responsibilities. These include:\n• exercising their business judgment in good faith;\n• acting in what they reasonably believe to be the best interest of all stockholders;\n• becoming and remaining well-informed about the Company’s business and\noperations and general business and economic trends affecting the Company; and\n• ensuring that the business of the Company is conducted so as to further the long-\nterm interests of its stockholders.\nJ. Compensation\nThe Board believes that director compensation should fairly pay directors for work\nrequired in a business of the Company’s size and scope, and that compensation should align\ndirectors’ interests with the long-term interests of stockholders. The Compensation Committee\nwill review and make recommendations to the Board regarding the cash and equity compensation\nof directors. The Company’s executive officers do not receive additional compensation for their\nservice as directors.\nExcept as otherwise permitted by the applicable NASDAQ rules, members of the Audit\nCommittee and Compensation Committee may not directly or indirectly receive any compensation\nfrom the Company other than their directors’ compensation, which may include any compensation\nfor service on committees of the Board and the receipt of equity incentive awards.\nK. Stock Ownership\nTo align the interests of its non-employee directors with the interests of stockholders and\nto further promote the Company’s commitment to sound corporate governance, the Board has\nadopted the Stock Ownership Policy set forth in Attachment B to these Guidelines.\nL. Board Access to Senior Management\n3\nVirco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nThe Board will have complete access to Company management to ensure that directors can\nask any questions and receive all information necessary to perform their duties. Directors should\nexercise judgment to ensure that their contact with management does not distract managers from\ntheir jobs or disturb the business operations of the Company. Any meetings or contacts that a\ndirector wishes to initiate may be arranged through the Chief Executive Officer or the Chairman\nof the Board, or if neither is available or neither is appropriate, directly by the director. To the\nextent appropriate, such contact, if in writing, should be copied to the Chief Executive Officer of\nthe Company.\nM. Board Access to Independent Advisors\nThe Board committees may hire independent advisors as set forth in their applicable\ncharters. The Board as a whole shall have access to any independent advisor retained by the\nCompany, and the Board may hire any independent advisor it considers necessary to discharge its\nresponsibilities.\nN. Self-Evaluation\nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will oversee a periodic assessment\nof the Board and its committees.\nII. BOARD MEETINGS\nA. Frequency of Meetings\nThe Board will meet at least four (4) times annually. In addition, special meetings may be\ncalled from time to time as determined by the needs of the business. It is the responsibility of the\ndirectors to attend meetings.\nB. Director Attendance\nA director is expected to spend the time and effort necessary to properly discharge his or\nher responsibilities. Accordingly, a director is expected to regularly prepare for and attend\nmeetings of the Board and all committees on which the director sits (including separate meetings\nof the Independent Directors), with the understanding that, on occasion, a director may be unable\nto attend a meeting. A director who is unable to attend a meeting of the Board or a committee of\nthe Board is expected to notify the Chairman of the Board or the Chairman of the appropriate\ncommittee in advance of such meeting, and, whenever possible, participate in such meeting via\nteleconference in the case of an in-person meeting.\n4\nVirco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nC. Attendance of Non-Directors\nThe Board encourages the Chairman of the Board or of any committee to invite Company\nmanagement and outside advisors or consultants from time to time to participate in Board and/or\ncommittee meetings to (i) provide insight into items being discussed by the Board which involve\nthe manager, advisor or consultant, (ii) make presentations to the Board on matters which involve\nthe manager, advisor or consultant, and (iii) bring managers with high potential into contact with\nthe Board. Attendance of non-directors at Board meetings is at the discretion of the Board.\nD. Advance Receipt of Meeting Materials\nInformation regarding the topics to be considered at a meeting is essential to the Board’s\nunderstanding of the business and the preparation of the directors for a productive meeting. To\nthe extent feasible, the meeting agenda and any written materials relating to each Board meeting\nwill be distributed to the directors sufficiently in advance of each meeting to allow for meaningful\nreview of such agenda and materials by the directors. Directors are expected to have reviewed and\nbe prepared to discuss all materials distributed in advance of any meeting.\nIII. COMMITTEE MATTERS\nThe Board currently has three (3) standing committees: (i) the Audit Committee, (ii) the\nCompensation Committee and (iii) the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Each\ncommittee will perform its duties as assigned by the Board in compliance with the Company’s\nbylaws and the committee’s charter.\nIV. SUCCESSION PLANNING\nThe Board (or a committee delegated by the Board) will (i) work on a periodic basis with\nthe Chief Executive Officer to evaluate the Company’s succession plans upon the Chief Executive\nOfficer’s retirement and in the event of an unexpected occurrence, and (ii) periodically review the\nperformance of the Chief Executive Officer.\nV. DIRECTOR RESIGNATION POLICY\nUnder the Company’s bylaws and in accordance with Delaware law, directors are elected\nby a plurality, meaning the directors receiving the highest number of votes for their election are\nelected as directors, based upon the number of directors being elected. In order to address the\nsituation in which a nominee for the Board of Directors is elected to the Board in an uncontested\nelection, despite receiving more votes “withheld” or “against” for his or her election than votes\n“for” his or her election (“Majority Withheld Vote”), the Board has adopted this director\nresignation policy (the “Resignation Policy”). For purposes of this Resignation Policy, an\n“uncontested election” is any election of directors in which the number of nominees for election\nis less than or equal to the number of directors to be elected.\n5\nVirco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nUpon adoption of this Resignation Policy and as a condition to nomination for election or\nre-election as director, each director shall tender irrevocable resignations, in the form set forth in\nAttachment C to these Guidelines, that will be effective upon the occurrence of both (1) a Majority\nWithheld Vote and (2) Board acceptance of such resignation. In addition, the Board shall fill\ndirector vacancies and new directorships only with candidates who tender, at or prior to the time\nof their appointment to the Board, the same form of resignation tendered by other directors in\naccordance with these Guidelines.\nIn the event one or more incumbent directors receives a Majority Withheld Vote (each, a\n“Subject Director”), either (i) the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or (ii) if one\nor more of the members of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is a Subject\nDirector or the Board determines that a committee other than the Corporate Governance and\nNominating Committee should recommend whether to accept the Subject Director’s resignation,\na committee consisting solely of Independent Directors (as determined in accordance with\napplicable NASDAQ rules and listing requirements) who are not Subject Directors (the committee\ndescribed in clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence, the “Committee” for purposes of these Guidelines)\nwill make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the Subject Director’s\npreviously tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board, not including\nany Subject Director, shall act with respect to any Subject Directors, taking into account the\nrecommendation of the Committee, within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of\nthe election results and shall notify the Subject Directors of its decision. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, if the result of accepting all tendered resignations then pending would be that the\nCompany would have fewer than three directors who were in office before the election of directors,\nthe Board may determine to extend such 90-day period by an additional ninety (90) days if it\ndetermines that such an extension is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nThe Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board in making its decision, may\neach consider all factors it considers relevant, including any stated reasons for “withheld” or\n“against” votes, whether the underlying cause or causes of the “withheld” or “against” votes are\ncurable, the length of service of each Subject Director, each Subject Director’s contributions to the\nCompany, whether the acceptance of any resignation would cause the Company to fail to comply\nwith any requirement of the NASDAQ Stock Market or any rule or regulation promulgated under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether acceptance of any resignation would\nlead to a “change of control” of the Company as determined pursuant to any financing or other\nmaterial agreement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and whether acceptance of any\nresignation would lead to a default under any material agreement to which the Company or any of\nits subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound. Subject Directors shall not participate in the\ndeliberation or recommendation(s) of the Committee or in the deliberation or decision(s) of the\nBoard. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all of the Independent Directors are Subject Directors,\nthen the Committee shall consist of all the Independent Directors, except for the Independent\nDirector whose resignation is under consideration, and furthermore, if the directors who are not\nSubject Directors constitute less than a quorum of the Board, then (i) all directors, except for the\ndirector whose resignation is under consideration, may participate in the Board’s deliberation and\ndecisions regarding whether to accept or reject the previously tendered resignations, and (ii) the\n6\nVirco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nBoard may determine that the effectiveness of its acceptance of any resignations of Subject\nDirectors will occur after the Board has considered the resignations of all Subject Directors.\nThe Company shall promptly disclose the decision(s) of the Board in a filing with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission of a Current Report on Form 8-K. If a Subject Director’s\ntendered resignation is not accepted by the Board, such director shall continue to serve until his or\nher successor is duly elected and qualified, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a Subject\nDirector’s resignation is accepted by the Board, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the\nnominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting\nvacancy or decrease the size of the Board in accordance with the Company’s bylaws.\n* * * * *\n7\nVirco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nAttachment A\nDirector Qualification Standards and Additional Selection Criteria\nDirector Qualification Standards:\nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, in recommending director\ncandidates for election to the Board, and the Board, in nominating director candidates, will\nconsider candidates who have a high level of personal and professional integrity, strong ethics and\nvalues and the ability to make mature business judgments.\nAdditional Selection Criteria:\nIn evaluating director candidates, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee\nand the Board may also consider the following criteria as well as any other factor that they deem\nto be relevant:\nA. The candidate’s experience in corporate management, such as serving as an\nofficer or former officer of a publicly held company;\nB. The candidate’s experience as a board member of another publicly held company;\nC. The candidate’s professional and academic experience relevant to the Company’s\nindustry;\nD. The strength of the candidate’s leadership skills;\nE. The candidate’s experience in finance and accounting and / or executive\ncompensation practices;\nF. Whether the candidate has the time required for preparation, participation and\nattendance at Board meetings and committee meetings, if applicable; and\nG. The nature of and time involved in a director’s service on other boards and/or\ncommittees.\nIn addition, the Board will consider whether there are potential conflicts of interest with\nthe candidate’s other personal and professional pursuits.\nThe Board should monitor the mix of specific experience, qualifications and skills of its\ndirectors in order to assure that the Board, as a whole, has the necessary tools to perform its\noversight function effectively in light of the Company’s business and structure.\nVirco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nAttachment B\nVIRCO MFG. CORPORATION\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP POLICY FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS\nStatement of Intent. The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Virco Mfg. Corporation (the\n“Company”) has adopted this Stock Ownership Policy (the “Policy”), originally effective February\n1, 2023, to align the interests of its non-employee directors (the “Covered Individuals”) with the\ninterests of stockholders and further promote the Company’s commitment to sound corporate\ngovernance.\nOwnership Levels. Covered Individuals are required to attain and maintain the Required Stock\nOwnership Level (as defined below), subject to the provisions of this Policy:\nCovered Individual Position Required Stock Ownership Level\nNon-Employee Directors 4 X the Covered Individual’s Annualized Cash Retainer\nValuation of Stock Ownership. Compliance with the Policy will be determined based on each\nCovered Individual’s Required Stock Ownership Level compared to such Covered Individual’s\nYear-End Stock Ownership (as defined below), each measured as of the last day of each fiscal year\nby comparing the following (using U.S. dollars). For purposes of this policy:\n “Year-End Stock Ownership” is equal to the Covered Individual’s Stock Owned (as\ndefined below), multiplied by the average daily closing price of the Company’s common\nstock for the fiscal year then ending; and\n “Annualized Cash Retainer” is the cash portion of the standard annual retainer paid by\nthe Company to the Covered Individual for service on the Board during the fiscal year,\nexcluding (i) any additional amounts paid for service on a Board committee or as a\nchairperson, and (ii) any additional amounts which the Covered Individual elected to\nreceive in cash in lieu of stock awards during the fiscal year. \nStock Ownership. For purposes of the Policy, “Stock Ownership” or “Stock Owned” shall include\nthe following, whether owned directly by, or held for the benefit of, the Covered Individual or any\nmember of his or her immediate family:\n Common stock of the Company;\n Company time-vested restricted stock or restricted stock units granted under the\nCompany’s 2019 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (or any predecessor or successor plan)\nwhich are to be settled in shares of common stock; and\n Company deferred stock units or similar deferred stock awards.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, unearned performance-based restricted stock or restricted stock units,\nshares underlying unexercised stock options (whether vested or unvested, whether time- or\nperformance-based and whether in-the-money or not), and similar equity awards other than the\nawards set forth above, do not count as Stock Owned.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nCompliance. Covered Individuals are required to hold 100% of the “net profit shares” resulting\nfrom stock option exercises and/or vesting of other stock-based awards until they reach their\nRequired Stock Ownership Level. “Net profit shares” refers to the number of shares actually held\nby the Covered Individual after covering withholding tax requirements (if applicable) and/or stock\noption exercise costs with a portion of the shares resulting from such exercise or vesting event.\nOnce covered by the Policy, Covered Individuals are expected to continuously accumulate\nqualifying equity until they meet the Required Stock Ownership Level set forth above. Once a\nCovered Individual has achieved the Required Stock Ownership Level, such Covered Individual\nmust maintain Stock Ownership at or above the Required Stock Ownership Level (or in the event\nsuch Covered Individual ceases to meet the Required Stock Ownership Level as a result of the\nincrease in such Covered Individual’s annualized cash retainer, such Covered Individual must\ncomply with the preceding paragraph until such Required Stock Ownership Level is attained).\nObservance of Securities Trading Policy. Covered Individuals are required to comply with the\nCompany’s Insider Trading Policy prior to purchasing or selling any securities of the Company.\nAdministration. The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board will be\nresponsible for monitoring the compliance of non-employee directors with the Policy. The\nCommittee will review compliance with the Policy in the first quarter of each fiscal year, beginning\nwith fiscal year 2023. In the event of non-compliance with the Policy, the Committee shall\nrecommend to the Board the remedial actions to be taken based on relevant circumstances. There\nmay be rare instances in which this Policy would place a hardship on the Covered Individual. In\nsuch instances, the Committee may recommend to the Board an alternative stock ownership\narrangement that reflects both the intention of this Policy and the individual’s circumstances.\nPeriodically, the Committee will review the Policy to assess its continued appropriateness and to\nensure it best achieves its objectives. The Board reserves the right to modify, amend or terminate\nthe Policy at any time.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nAttachment C\nForm Director Resignation Letter\n[Date]\nVirco Mfg.

          "content": "Clawback Policy\nVIRCO MFG. CORPORATION\nCLAWBACK POLICY\n(as amended and restated October 17, 2023)\nIntroduction\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Virco Mfg. Corporation (the “Company”)\nbelieves that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain\na culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-\nperformance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this policy which\nprovides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting\nrestatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under\nthe federal securities laws (the “Policy”). This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).\nAdministration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the\nCompensation Committee, in which case references herein to the Board shall be deemed\nreferences to the Compensation Committee. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final\nand binding on all affected individuals.\nCovered Executives\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s current and former president, principal financial\nofficer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any\nvice-president of the issuer in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as\nsales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or\nany other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company (“Covered\nExecutives”).\nRecoupment; Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial\nstatements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting\nrequirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an\nerror in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial\nstatements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current\nperiod or left uncorrected in the current period, the Board will require reasonably prompt\nreimbursement or forfeiture of any excess Incentive Compensation received by any Covered\nExecutive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the\nCompany is required to prepare an accounting restatement. The Company is deemed required to\nprepare an accounting restatement on the earlier to occur of: the date the Board (or if applicable\nthe Compensation Committee) concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the\nCompany is required to prepare an accounting restatement, or the date a court, regulator, or other\nlegally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an accounting restatement.\nIncentive Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive Compensation” means any compensation that is\ngranted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a Financial Reporting\nMeasure (as defined below).\nIncentive Compensation is subject to clawback under this Policy only if the Covered Executive\nserved as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period applicable to the\nIncentive Compensation in question. Further, the Policy shall only apply if the Incentive\nCompensation is received while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national\nsecurities exchange or a national securities association and on or after October 2, 2023. Incentive\nCompensation is deemed received in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial\nReporting Measure specified in the Incentive Compensation award is attained, even if the\npayment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n“Financial Reporting Measures” are measures that are determined and presented in accordance\nwith the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any\nmeasures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures including without limitation\nCompany stock price and total shareholder return.\nExcess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount to be recovered will be the excess of the Incentive Compensation received by\nthe Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive Compensation that would\nhave been received by the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results (with such\nIncentive Compensation computed in each case without regard to any taxes paid), as determined\nby the Board.\nIf the Board cannot determine the amount of excess Incentive Compensation received by\nthe Covered Executive directly from the information in the accounting restatement, then it will\nmake its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting\nrestatement.\nThe Company shall not be required under this Policy to recover excess Incentive\nCompensation if the Board has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable and\nany of the following conditions are met: after making a reasonable attempt to recover such\nexcess Incentive Compensation, the Board determines that the direct expense paid to a third\nparty to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (documentation\nevidencing the reasonable attempt to recover the excess Incentive Compensation must be\nmaintained and provided to the national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities\nare listed), or the recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under\nwhich benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the\nrequirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(13) or Internal Revenue Code Section\n411(a) and the regulations thereunder.\nMethod of Recoupment\nThe Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Incentive\nCompensation hereunder which may include, without limitation:\n(a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid;\n(b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale,\ntransfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\n(c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the\nCompany to the Covered Executive;\n(d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n(e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the\nBoard.\nNo Indemnification\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any\nincorrectly awarded Incentive Compensation.\nInterpretation\nThe Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all\ndeterminations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is\nintended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of\nSection 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities\nand Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Company’s\nsecurities are listed.\nEffective Date\nThis Policy, as amended and restated, shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the\nBoard (the “Effective Date”).\nAmendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this\nPolicy as it deems necessary to reflect final regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with any rules or standards\nadopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed. The\nBoard may terminate this Policy at any time.\nOther Recoupment Rights\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The\nBoard may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar\nagreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any\nbenefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy.\nAny right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies\nor rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any\nsimilar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and\nany other legal remedies available to the Company.\nImpracticability\nThe Board shall recover any excess Incentive Compensation in accordance with this\nPolicy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by the Board in accordance\nwith Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the national securities\nexchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\nSuccessors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their\nbeneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives."

CORPORATION\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nFederal and state laws prohibit trading in the securities of a company while in possession\nof material nonpublic information and providing material nonpublic information to others so that\nthey can trade. Violating such laws can undermine investor trust, harm Virco Mfg. Corporation’s\nreputation, and result in your dismissal from Virco Mfg. Corporation (together with its\nsubsidiaries, the “Company”) or even serious criminal and civil charges against you and the\nCompany.\nThis Insider Trading Compliance Policy (this “Policy”) outlines your responsibilities to\navoid insider trading and implements certain procedures to help you avoid even the appearance\nof insider trading.\nI. Summary\nPreventing insider trading is necessary to comply with securities laws and to preserve the\nreputation and integrity of the Company. “Insider trading” occurs when any person purchases\nor sells a security while in possession of material nonpublic information relating to the security.\nInsider trading is a crime. The criminal penalties for violating insider trading laws include\nimprisonment and fines of up to $5 million for individuals and $25 million for corporations.\nInsider trading may also result in civil penalties, including disgorgement of profits and civil fines.\nInsider trading is also prohibited by this Policy, and violation of this Policy may result in\nCompany-imposed sanctions, including removal or dismissal for cause.\nThis Policy applies to all officers, directors, and employees of the Company. As someone\nsubject to this Policy, you are responsible for ensuring that members of your household also\ncomply with this Policy. This Policy also applies to any entities you control, including any\ncorporations, partnerships, or trusts, and transactions by such entities should be treated for the\npurposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if they were for your own account. The\nCompany may determine that this Policy applies to additional persons with access to material\nnonpublic information, such as contractors or consultants. This Policy extends to all activities\nwithin and outside your Company duties. Every officer, director, and employee must review this\nPolicy. Questions regarding the Policy should be directed to the Company’s Compliance Officer\n(as defined below) or Corporate Controller.\nThe Company’s Chief Financial Officer (the “Compliance Officer”) shall be responsible for\nthe administration of this Policy.\nIn the absence of the Compliance Officer, responsibility for administering this Policy will\nrest with the Corporate Controller or such other employee as may be designated by the\nCompliance Officer.\nIn all cases, as someone subject to this Policy, you bear full responsibility for ensuring your\ncompliance with this Policy, and also for ensuring that members of your household (and\nVirco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nindividuals not residing in your household but whose transactions are subject to your influence\nor control) and entities under your influence or control are in compliance with this Policy.\nActions taken by the Company, the Compliance Officer, or any other Company personnel\ndo not constitute legal advice, nor do they insulate you from the consequences of noncompliance\nwith this Policy.\nII. Statement of Policies Prohibiting Insider Trading\nNo officer, director, or employee (or any other person designated as subject to this Policy)\nshall purchase or sell any type of security while in possession of material nonpublic information\nrelating to the security or the issuer of such security, whether the issuer of such security is the\nCompany or any other company.\nAdditionally, no director, executive officer, nor any other individual designated in writing\nfrom time to time by the Compliance Officer or Corporate Controller (each a “Covered Person”),\nshall purchase or sell any security of the Company outside of (1) the period of time beginning on\nthe second full trading day after the public release of earnings data for such fiscal quarter end of\nany of the first three fiscal quarters of the Company in any fiscal year (or such other date as may\nbe published by the Compliance Officer or Corporate Controller) and ending upon the 21st\ncalendar day before the end of any such fiscal quarter of the Company (or such other date that\nis published by the Compliance Officer or Corporate Controller), or (2) the period of time during\nthe fourth quarter of any fiscal year that is published by the Compliance Officer or Corporate\nController (each such period, the “Stock Trading Window”).\nThese prohibitions do not apply to:\n• purchases of the Company’s securities from the Company or sales of the\nCompany’s securities to the Company;\n• exercises of stock options or other equity awards or the surrender of shares to the\nCompany in payment of the exercise price or in satisfaction of any tax withholding\nobligations in a manner permitted by the applicable equity award agreement, or\nvesting of equity-based awards that, in each case, do not involve a market sale of\nthe Company’s securities (the “cashless exercise” of a Company stock option\nthrough a broker does involve a market sale of the Company’s securities, and\ntherefore would not qualify under this exception);\n• bona fide gifts of the Company’s securities; or\n• purchases or sales of the Company’s securities made pursuant to any binding\ncontract, specific instruction or written plan entered into while the purchaser or\nseller, as applicable, was unaware of any material nonpublic information and\nwhich contract, instruction, or plan (i) meets all requirements of the affirmative\ndefense provided by Rule 10b5-1 (“Rule 10b5-1”) promulgated under the\n2\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), (ii) was precleared\nin advance pursuant to this Policy and (iii) has not been amended or modified in\nany respect after such initial preclearance. For more information about Rule\n10b5-1 trading plans, see Section VI below.\nFrom time to time, events will occur that are material to the Company and cause certain\nofficers, directors, or employees to be in possession of material nonpublic information. When\nthat happens, the Company will recommend that those in possession of the material nonpublic\ninformation suspend all trading in the Company’s securities until the information is no longer\nmaterial or has been publicly disclosed.\nWhen such event-specific blackout periods occur, those subject to it will be notified by\nthe Company. The event-specific blackout period will not be announced to those not subject to\nit, and those subject to it or otherwise aware of it should not disclose it to others.\nEven if the Company has not notified you that you are subject to an event-specific\nblackout period, if you are aware of material nonpublic information about the Company, you\nshould not trade in Company securities. Any failure by the Company to designate you as subject\nto an event-specific blackout period, or to notify you of such designation, does not relieve you of\nyour obligation not to trade in the Company’s securities while possessing material nonpublic\ninformation.\nNo officer, director, or employee shall directly or indirectly communicate (or “tip”)\nmaterial nonpublic information to anyone outside the Company (except in accordance with the\nCompany’s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of Company\ninformation) or to anyone within the Company other than on a “need-to-know” basis.\nIII. Explanation of Insider Trading\n“Insider trading” refers to the purchase or sale of a security while in possession of material\nnonpublic information relating to the security.\n“Securities” includes stocks, bonds, notes, debentures, options, warrants, and other\nconvertible securities, as well as derivative instruments.\n“Purchase” and “sale” are defined broadly under the federal securities law. “Purchase”\nincludes not only the actual purchase of a security, but any contract to purchase or otherwise\nacquire a security. “Sale” includes not only the actual sale of a security, but any contract to sell\nor otherwise dispose of a security. These definitions extend to a broad range of transactions,\nincluding conventional cash-for-stock transactions, conversions, the exercise of stock options,\nand acquisitions and exercises of warrants or puts, calls, or other derivative securities.\nA. What Facts Are Material?\nThe materiality of a fact depends upon the circumstances. A fact is considered “material”\nif there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in\n3\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nmaking a decision to buy, sell, or hold a security, or if the fact is likely to have a significant effect\non the market price of the security. Material information can be positive or negative and can\nrelate to virtually any aspect of a company’s business or to any type of security, debt, or equity.\nAlso, information that something is likely to happen in the future—or even just that it may\nhappen—could be deemed material.\nExamples of material information include (but are not limited to) information about\ndividends; corporate earnings or earnings forecasts; possible mergers, acquisitions, tender offers,\nor dispositions; major new products or product developments; important business developments\nsuch as major contract awards or cancellations, trial results, developments regarding strategic\ncollaborators, or the status of regulatory submissions; management or control changes;\nsignificant borrowing or financing developments, including pending public sales or offerings of\ndebt or equity securities; defaults on borrowings; bankruptcies; cybersecurity or data security\nincidents; and significant litigation or regulatory actions. Moreover, material information does\nnot have to be related to a company’s business. For example, the contents of a forthcoming\nnewspaper column that is expected to affect the market price of a security can be material.\nQuestions regarding material information should be directed to the Company’s\nCompliance Officer. A good rule of thumb: When in doubt, do not trade.\nB. What Is Nonpublic?\nInformation is “nonpublic” if it is not available to the general public. In order for\ninformation to be considered public, it must be widely disseminated in a manner making it\ngenerally available to investors through newswire services such as Dow Jones, Reuters,\nBloomberg, Business Wire, The Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, or United Press\nInternational; a broadcast on widely available radio or television programs; publication in a\nwidely available newspaper, magazine, or news website; a Regulation FD-compliant conference\ncall; or public disclosure documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) that are available on the SEC’s website. Note that simply posting information to the\nCompany’s website may not be sufficient disclosure to make the information public.\nThe circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media, does not constitute\neffective public dissemination. In addition, even after a public announcement, a reasonable\nperiod of time must lapse in order for the market to react to the information. Generally, one\nshould allow two full trading days following publication as a reasonable waiting period before\nsuch information is deemed to be public.\nC. Who Is an Insider?\n“Insiders” include officers, directors, and any employees of a company, or anyone else\nwho has material nonpublic information about a company. Insiders have independent fiduciary\nduties to their company and its stockholders not to trade on material nonpublic information\nrelating to the company’s securities. Insiders may not trade in the Company’s securities while in\npossession of material nonpublic information relating to the Company, nor may they tip such\n4\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\ninformation to anyone outside the Company (except in accordance with the Company’s policies\nregarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of Company information) or to anyone\nwithin the Company other than on a “need-to-know” basis.\nAs someone subject to this Policy, you are responsible for ensuring that members of your\nhousehold also comply with this Policy. This includes family members residing with you, anyone\nelse living in your household, and any family members not living with you whose transactions in\nthe Company’s securities are directed by you, or subject to your influence and control. This Policy\nalso applies to any entities you control, including any corporations, partnerships, or trusts, and\ntransactions by these entities should be treated for the purposes of this Policy and applicable\nsecurities laws as if they were for your own account.\nD. Trading by Persons Other Than Insiders\nInsiders may be liable for communicating or tipping material nonpublic information to a\nthird party (“tippee”), and insider trading violations are not limited to trading or tipping by\ninsiders. Persons other than insiders can also be liable for insider trading, including tippees who\ntrade on material nonpublic information tipped to them or individuals who trade on material\nnonpublic information that has been misappropriated. Insiders may be held liable for tipping\neven if they receive no personal benefit from tipping and even if no close personal relationship\nexists between them and the tippee.\nTippees inherit an insider’s duties and are liable for trading on material nonpublic\ninformation illegally tipped to them by an insider. Similarly, just as insiders are liable for the\ninsider trading of their tippees, so are tippees who pass the information along to others who\ntrade. In other words, a tippee’s liability for insider trading is no different from that of an insider.\nTippees can obtain material nonpublic information by receiving overt tips from others or through,\namong other things, conversations at social, business, or other gatherings.\nE. Penalties for Engaging in Insider Trading\nPenalties for trading on or tipping material nonpublic information can extend significantly\nbeyond any profits made or losses avoided, both for individuals engaging in such unlawful\nconduct and their employers. The SEC and Department of Justice have made the civil and criminal\nprosecution of insider trading violations a top priority. Enforcement remedies available to the\ngovernment or private plaintiffs under the federal securities laws include:\n• SEC administrative sanctions;\n• securities industry self-regulatory organization sanctions;\n• civil injunctions;\n• damage awards to private plaintiffs;\n• disgorgement of all profits;\n5\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\n• civil fines for the violator of up to three times the amount of profit gained or loss\navoided;\n• civil fines for the employer or other controlling person of a violator (i.e., where\nthe violator is an employee or other controlled person) of up to the greater of\n$1.425 million or three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided by the\nviolator;\n• criminal fines for individual violators of up to $5 million ($25 million for an entity);\nand\n• jail sentences of up to 20 years.\nIn addition, insider trading could result in serious sanctions by the Company, including\ndismissal. Insider trading violations are not limited to violations of the federal securities laws.\nOther federal and state civil or criminal laws, such as the laws prohibiting mail and wire fraud and\nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), may also be violated in\nconnection with insider trading.\nF. Size of Transaction and Reason for Transaction Do Not Matter\nThe size of the transaction or the amount of profit received does not have to be significant\nto result in prosecution. The SEC has the ability to monitor even the smallest trades, and the SEC\nperforms routine market surveillance. Brokers or dealers are required by law to inform the SEC\nof any possible violations by people who may have material nonpublic information. The SEC\naggressively investigates even small insider trading violations.\nG. Examples of Insider Trading\nExamples of insider trading cases include actions brought against officers, directors, and\nemployees who traded in a company’s securities after learning of significant confidential\ncorporate developments; friends, business associates, family members, and other tippees of such\nofficers, directors, and employees who traded in the securities after receiving such information;\ngovernment employees who learned of such information in the course of their employment; and\nother persons who misappropriated, and took advantage of, confidential information from their\nemployers.\nThe following are illustrations of insider trading violations. These illustrations are\nhypothetical and, consequently, not intended to reflect on the actual activities or business of the\nCompany or any other entity.\nTrading by Insider\nAn officer of X Corporation learns that earnings to be reported by X Corporation\nwill increase dramatically. Prior to the public announcement of such earnings, the\nofficer purchases X Corporation’s stock. The officer, an insider, is liable for all\n6\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nprofits as well as penalties of up to three times the amount of all profits. The\nofficer is also subject to, among other things, criminal prosecution, including up to\n$5 million in additional fines and 20 years in jail. Depending upon the\ncircumstances, X Corporation and the individual to whom the officer reports could\nalso be liable as controlling persons.\nTrading by Tippee\nAn officer of X Corporation tells a friend that X Corporation is about to publicly\nannounce that it has concluded an agreement for a major acquisition. This tip\ncauses the friend to purchase X Corporation’s stock in advance of the\nannouncement. The officer is jointly liable with his friend for all of the friend’s\nprofits, and each is liable for all civil penalties of up to three times the amount of\nthe friend’s profits. The officer and his friend are also subject to criminal\nprosecution and other remedies and sanctions, as described above.\nH. Prohibition of Records Falsification and False Statements\nSection 13(b)(2) of the 1934 Act requires companies subject to the 1934 Act to maintain\nproper internal books and records and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal\naccounting controls. The SEC has supplemented the statutory requirements by adopting rules\nthat prohibit (i) any person from falsifying records or accounts subject to the above requirements,\nand (ii) officers or directors from making any materially false, misleading, or incomplete\nstatement to any accountant in connection with any audit or filing with the SEC. These provisions\nreflect the SEC’s intent to discourage officers, directors, and other persons with access to the\nCompany’s books and records from taking action that might result in the communication of\nmaterially misleading financial information to the investing public. Falsifying records or accounts\nor making materially false, misleading, or incomplete statements in connection with an audit or\nfiling with the SEC could also result in criminal penalties for obstruction of justice.\nIV. Statement of Procedures to Prevent Insider Trading\nThe following procedures have been established, and will be maintained and enforced,\nby the Company to prevent insider trading.\nA. Blackout Periods\nThe period during which the Company prepares quarterly financials is a sensitive time for\ninsider trading purposes, as Company personnel may be more likely to possess, or be presumed to\npossess, material nonpublic information. To avoid the appearance of impropriety and assist\nCompany personnel in planning transactions in the Company’s securities for appropriate times, no\nCovered Person shall purchase or sell any security of the Company outside the Stock Trading\nWindow, except for:\n7\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\n• purchases of the Company’s securities from the Company or sales of the\nCompany’s securities to the Company;\n• exercises of stock options or other equity awards, the surrender of shares to the\nCompany in payment of the exercise price or in satisfaction of any tax withholding\nobligations in a manner permitted by the applicable equity award agreement, or\nthe vesting of equity-based awards that do not involve a market sale of the\nCompany’s securities (the cashless exercise of a Company stock option through a\nbroker does involve a market sale of the Company’s securities, and therefore\nwould not qualify under this exception);\n• bona fide gifts of the Company’s securities; and\n• purchases or sales of the Company’s securities made pursuant to any binding\ncontract, specific instruction, or written plan entered into while the purchaser or\nseller, as applicable, was unaware of any material nonpublic information and\nwhich contract, instruction, or plan (i) meets all requirements of the affirmative\ndefense provided by Rule 10b5-1, (ii) was precleared in advance pursuant to this\nPolicy, and (iii) has not been amended or modified in any respect after such initial\npreclearance.\nExceptions to the blackout period policy may be approved only by the Company’s\nCompliance Officer or Corporate Controller or, in the case of exceptions for directors, the Board\nof Directors or Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nFrom time to time, the Company, through the Board of Directors, the Compliance Officer,\nor the Corporate Controller, may recommend that officers, directors, employees, or others\nsuspend trading in the Company’s securities because of developments that have not yet been\ndisclosed to the public. Subject to the exceptions noted above, all those affected should not\ntrade in the Company’s securities while the suspension is in effect, and should not disclose to\nothers that the Company has suspended trading.\nB. Preclearance of All Trades by All Officers, Directors and Employees\nTo provide assistance in preventing inadvertent violations of applicable securities laws\nand to avoid the appearance of impropriety in connection with the purchase and sale of the\nCompany’s securities, all transactions in the Company’s securities (including, without limitation,\nacquisitions and dispositions of Company stock, the exercise of stock options, elective\ntransactions under 401(k)/ESPP/deferred compensation plans, and the sale of Company stock\nissued upon exercise of stock options) by Covered Persons must be precleared by the Company’s\nCompliance Officer or Corporate Controller, except for certain exempt transactions as explained\nin Section VI of this Policy. Preclearance does not relieve you of your responsibility under SEC\nrules.\n8\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nA request for preclearance must be in writing (including by e-mail), should be made at\nleast two business days in advance of the proposed transaction, and should include the identity\nof the Covered Person, the type of proposed transaction (for example, an open market purchase,\na privately negotiated sale, an option exercise, etc.), the proposed date of the transaction, and\nthe number of shares or other securities to be involved. In addition, the Covered Person must\nexecute a certification (in the form approved by the Company’s Compliance Officer or Corporate\nController) that he or she is not aware of material nonpublic information about the Company.\nThe Compliance Officer or Corporate Controller shall have sole discretion to decide whether to\nclear any contemplated transaction. (The Chief Executive Officer or President shall have sole\ndiscretion to decide whether to clear transactions by the Compliance Officer or Corporate\nController or persons or entities subject to this policy as a result of their relationship with the\nCompliance Officer or Corporate Controller.) All trades that are precleared must be effected\nwithin five business days of receipt of the preclearance, unless a specific exception has been\ngranted by the Compliance Officer or Corporate Controller. A precleared trade (or any portion\nof a precleared trade) that has not been effected during the five business day period must be\nprecleared again prior to execution. Notwithstanding receipt of preclearance, if the Covered\nPerson becomes aware of material nonpublic information or becomes subject to a blackout\nperiod before the transaction is effected, the transaction may not be completed.\nNone of the Company, the Compliance Officer, the Corporate Controller, or the\nCompany’s other employees will have any liability for any delay in reviewing, or refusal of, a\nrequest for preclearance submitted pursuant to this Section IV.B. Notwithstanding any\npreclearance of a transaction pursuant to this Section IV.B, none of the Company, the Compliance\nOfficer, the Corporate Controller, or the Company’s other employees assumes any liability for\nthe legality or consequences of such transaction to the person engaging in such transaction.\nC. Post-Termination Transactions\nWith the exception of the preclearance requirement, this Policy continues to apply to\ntransactions in the Company’s securities even after termination of service to the Company. If\nyou are in possession of material nonpublic information when your service terminates, you may\nnot trade in the Company’s securities until that information has become public or is no longer\nmaterial.\nD. Information Relating to the Company\n!\n1. Access to Information\nAccess to material nonpublic information about the Company, including the Company’s\nbusiness, earnings, or prospects, should be limited to officers, directors, and employees of the\nCompany on a “need-to-know” basis. In addition, such information should not be communicated\nto anyone outside the Company under any circumstances (except in accordance with the\nCompany’s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of Company\ninformation) or to anyone within the Company on an other than “need-to-know” basis.\n9\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nIn communicating material nonpublic information to employees of the Company, all\nofficers, directors, and employees must take care to emphasize the need for confidential\ntreatment of such information and adherence to the Company’s policies with regard to\nconfidential information.\n!\n2. Inquiries From Third Parties\nInquiries from third parties, such as industry analysts or members of the media, about the\nCompany should be directed to the Compliance Officer or the Corporate Controller.\nE. Limitations on Access to Company Information\nThe following procedures are designed to maintain confidentiality with respect to the\nCompany’s business operations and activities.\nAll officers, directors, and employees should take all steps and precautions necessary to\nrestrict access to, and secure, material nonpublic information by, among other things:\n• maintaining the confidentiality of Company-related transactions;\n• conducting their business and social activities so as not to risk inadvertent\ndisclosure of confidential information. Review of confidential documents in public\nplaces should be conducted so as to prevent access by unauthorized persons;\n• restricting access to documents and files (including computer files) containing\nmaterial nonpublic information to individuals on a “need-to-know” basis\n(including maintaining control over the distribution of documents and drafts of\ndocuments);\n• promptly removing and cleaning up all confidential documents and other\nmaterials from conference rooms following the conclusion of any meetings;\n• disposing of all confidential documents and other papers once there is no longer\nany business or other legally required need — through shredders when\nappropriate;\n• restricting access to areas likely to contain confidential documents or material\nnonpublic information;\n• safeguarding laptop computers, tablets, memory sticks, CDs, and other items that\ncontain confidential information; and\n• avoiding the discussion of material nonpublic information in places where the\ninformation could be overheard by others, such as in elevators, restrooms,\nhallways, restaurants, airplanes, or taxicabs.\n10\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nPersonnel involved with material nonpublic information, to the extent feasible, should\nconduct their business and activities in areas separate from other Company activities.\nV. Additional Prohibited Transactions\nThe Company has determined that there is a heightened legal risk and/or the appearance\nof improper or inappropriate conduct if the persons subject to this Policy engage in certain types\nof transactions. Therefore, officers, directors, and employees shall comply with the following\npolicies with respect to certain transactions in the Company securities:\nA. Short Sales\nShort sales of the Company’s securities evidence an expectation on the part of the seller\nthat the securities will decline in value, and therefore signal to the market that the seller has no\nconfidence in the Company or its short-term prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce the\nseller’s incentive to improve the Company’s performance. For these reasons, short sales of the\nCompany’s securities are prohibited by this Policy. In addition, as noted below, Section 16(c) of\nthe 1934 Act absolutely prohibits Section 16 reporting persons from making short sales of the\nCompany’s equity securities, i.e., sales of shares that the insider does not own at the time of sale, or\nsales of shares against which the insider does not deliver the shares within 20 days after the sale.\nB. Publicly Traded Options\nA transaction in options is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement of the Company’s\nstock and therefore creates the appearance that an officer, director, or employee is trading based\non material nonpublic information. Transactions in options may also focus an officer’s, director’s,\nor employee’s attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company’s long-term\nobjectives. Accordingly, transactions in puts, calls, or other derivative securities involving the\nCompany’s equity securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market, are prohibited by\nthis Policy.\nC. Hedging Transactions\nCertain forms of hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and\nforward sale contracts, allow an officer, director, or employee to lock in much of the value of his\nor her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside appreciation in\nthe stock. Such transactions allow the officer, director, or employee to continue to own the\ncovered securities, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the\nofficer, director, or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the Company’s other\nstockholders. Therefore, such transactions involving the Company’s equity securities are\nprohibited by this Policy.\nD. Margin Accounts and Pledging\nYou are prohibited from pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan, purchasing\nCompany securities on margin (i.e. borrowing money to purchase the securities) or placing\n11\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nCompany securities in a margin account. This prohibition does not apply to cashless exercises of\nstock options under the Company’s equity plans or to situations approved in advance by the\nCompliance Officer or Corporate Controller.\nE. Director and Executive Officer Cashless Exercises\nThe Company will not arrange with brokers to administer cashless exercises on behalf of\ndirectors and executive officers of the Company. Directors and executive officers of the Company\nmay use the cashless exercise feature of their equity awards only if (i) the director or officer\nretains a broker independently of the Company, (ii) the Company’s involvement is limited to\nconfirming that it will deliver the stock promptly upon payment of the exercise price, and (iii) the\ndirector or officer uses a cashless exercise arrangement, in which the Company agrees to deliver\nstock against the payment of the purchase price on the same day the sale of the stock underlying\nthe equity award settles. Under a cashless exercise, a broker, the issuer, and the issuer’s transfer\nagent work together to make all transactions settle simultaneously. This approach is to avoid\nany inference that the Company has “extended credit” in the form of a personal loan to the\ndirector or executive officer. Questions about cashless exercises should be directed to the\nCompliance Officer or Corporate Controller.\nF. Partnership Distributions\nNothing in this Policy is intended to limit the ability of a venture capital partnership or\nother similar entity with which a director is affiliated to distribute Company securities to its\npartners, members, or other similar persons. It is the responsibility of each affected director and\nthe affiliated entity, in consultation with their own counsel (as appropriate), to determine the\ntiming of any distributions, based on all relevant facts and circumstances and applicable\nsecurities laws.\nVI. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans, Section 16, and Rule 144\nA. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nThe trading restrictions set forth do not apply to transactions under a previously\nestablished contract, plan, or instruction to trade in the Company’s stock in accordance with the\nterms of Rule 10b5-1 and all applicable state laws (a “Trading Plan”) that:\n• has been submitted to and preapproved by the Company’s Compliance Officer or\nCorporate Controller, or such other person as the Board of Directors may\ndesignate from time to time (the “Authorizing Officer”), at least 30 days before\nthe commencement of any transactions under the Trading Plan or such longer\ntime as may be required by applicable law;\n• you entered into in good faith at a time when you were not in possession of\nmaterial nonpublic information about the Company; and\n12\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\n• either (i) specifies the amounts, prices, and dates of all security transactions under\nthe Trading Plan, (ii) provides a written formula, algorithm, or computer program\nfor determining the amount, price, and date of the transactions, or (iii) prohibits\nyou from exercising any subsequent influence over the transactions.\nYou may adopt more than one Trading Plan at a time. You may only amend or revoke a\nTrading Plan outside of quarterly trading blackout periods when you do not possess material\nnonpublic information. Any amendment or revocation of a Trading Plan must be preapproved\nby the Authorizing Officer at least 30 days before you trade under an amended or outside of a\nrevoked Trading Plan or such longer time as may be required by applicable law, and at least 180\ndays before you establish a new Trading Plan.\nThe Company reserves the right to publicly announce, or respond to inquiries from the\nmedia regarding, the implementation of Trading Plans or the execution of transactions made\nunder a Trading Plan. The Company also reserves the right from time to time to suspend,\ndiscontinue, or otherwise prohibit transactions under a Trading Plan if the Authorizing Officer or\nthe Board of Directors, in its discretion, determines that such suspension, discontinuation, or\nother prohibition is in the best interests of the Company.\nThe cashless exercise of options under Trading Plans is permitted only through “same-day\nsales,” in which the option holder does not pay for the stock up front, but rather receives cash\nequal to the difference between the stock value and option exercise price. Transactions\nprohibited under Section V of this Policy, including short sales and hedging transactions, may not\nbe carried out through a Trading Plan.\nCompliance of a Trading Plan with the terms of Rule 10b5-1 and the execution of\ntransactions pursuant to the Trading Plan are the sole responsibility of the person initiating the\nTrading Plan, and none of the Company, the Authorizing Officer, or the Company’s other\nemployees assume any liability for any delay in reviewing and/or refusing a Trading Plan\nsubmitted for approval nor the legality or consequences relating to a person entering into or\ntrading under a Trading Plan.\nTrading Plans do not exempt you from complying with Section 16 short-swing profit rules\nor liability.\nDuring an open trading window, trades differing from Trading Plan instructions that are\nalready in place are allowed as long as the Trading Plan continues to be followed.\nB. Section 16: Insider Reporting Requirements, Short-Swing Profits, and Short\nSales (Applicable to Officers, Directors, and 10% Stockholders)\n!\n1. Reporting Obligations Under Section 16(a): SEC Forms 3, 4, and 5\nSection 16(a) of the 1934 Act generally requires all officers, directors, and 10%\nstockholders (“Section 16 Insiders”), within 10 days after becoming a Section 16 Insider, to file\n13\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nwith the SEC an “Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities” on SEC Form 3, listing\nthe amount of the Company’s stock, options, and warrants that the Section 16 Insider beneficially\nowns. Following the initial filing on SEC Form 3, changes in beneficial ownership of the\nCompany’s stock, options, and warrants must be reported on SEC Form 4, generally within two\ndays after the date on which such change occurs, or in certain cases on Form 5, within 45 days\nafter fiscal year-end. The two-day Form 4 deadline begins to run from the trade date rather than\nthe settlement date. A Form 4 must be filed even if, as a result of balancing transactions, there\nhas been no net change in holdings. In certain situations, purchases or sales of Company stock\nmade within six months prior to the filing of a Form 3 must be reported on Form 4. Similarly, certain\npurchases or sales of Company stock made within six months after an officer or director ceases to\nbe a Section 16 Insider must be reported on Form 4.\n!\n2. Recovery of Profits Under Section 16(b)\nFor the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information that may have been obtained\nby a Section 16 Insider, any profits realized by a Section 16 Insider from any “purchase” and “sale”\nof Company stock during a six-month period, so called “short-swing profits,” may be recovered\nby the Company. When such a purchase and sale occurs, good faith is no defense. The insider is\nliable, even if compelled to sell for personal reasons, and even if the sale takes place after full\ndisclosure and without the use of any material nonpublic information.\nThe Section 16 Insider under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act is only to the Company itself.\nThe Company, however, cannot waive its right to short swing profits, and any Company\nstockholder can bring suit in the name of the Company. Reports of ownership filed with the SEC\non Form 3, Form 4, or Form 5 pursuant to Section 16(a) (discussed above) are readily available to\nthe public, and certain attorneys carefully monitor these reports for potential Section 16(b)\nviolations. In addition, liabilities under Section 16(b) may require separate disclosure in the\nCompany’s annual report to the SEC on Form 10-K or its proxy statement for its annual meeting\nof stockholders. No suit may be brought more than two years after the date the profit was\nrealized. However, if the Section 16 Insider fails to file a report of the transaction under\nSection 16(a), as required, the two-year limitation period does not begin to run until after the\ntransactions giving rise to the profit have been disclosed. Failure to report transactions and late\nfiling of reports require separate disclosure in the Company’s proxy statement.\nOfficers and directors should consult the attached “Short-Swing Profit Rule Section 16(b)\nChecklist” attached hereto as “Attachment A” in addition to consulting the Compliance Officer or\nCorporate Controller prior to engaging in any transactions involving the Company’s securities,\nincluding, without limitation, the Company’s stock, options, or warrants.\n!\n3. Short Sales Prohibited Under Section 16(c)\nSection 16(c) of the 1934 Act absolutely prohibits Section 16 Insiders from making short\nsales of the Company’s equity securities. Short sales include sales of stock that the Section 16\nInsider does not own at the time of sale, or sales of stock against which the Section 16 Insider\ndoes not deliver the shares within 20 days after the sale. Under certain circumstances, the\n14\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\npurchase or sale of put or call options, or the writing of such options, can result in a violation of\nSection 16(c). Section 16 Insiders violating Section 16(c) face criminal liability.\nYou should consult the Compliance Officer or Corporate Controller if you have any\nquestions regarding reporting obligations, short-swing profits or short sales under Section 16.\nC. Rule 144 (Applicable to Section 16 Insiders)\nRule 144 provides a safe harbor exemption to the registration requirements of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, for certain resales of “restricted securities” and “control\nsecurities.” “Restricted securities” are securities acquired from an issuer, or an affiliate of an\nissuer, in a transaction, or chain of transactions, not involving a public offering. “Control\nsecurities” are any securities owned by directors, executive officers, or other “affiliates” of the\nissuer, including stock purchased in the open market and stock received upon exercise of stock\noptions. Sales of Company securities by affiliates (generally, Section 16 Insiders of the Company)\nmust comply with the requirements of Rule 144, which are summarized below:\n• \"!##$%’& ’(,+\"*) %-.//+%&#120 The Company must have filed all SEC-required\nreports during the last 12 months.\n• 3\"$/’0* /%+52&1&+0+4 Total sales of Company common stock by a covered\nindividual for any three-month period may not exceed the greater of: (i) 1% of\nthe total number of outstanding shares of Company common stock, as reflected\nin the most recent report or statement published by the Company, or (ii) the\naverage weekly reported volume of such shares traded during the four calendar\nweeks preceding the filing of the requisite Form 144.\n• $9*1/.’76$&/’8 2 The shares must be sold either in a “broker’s transaction” or in a\ntransaction directly with a “market maker.” A “broker’s transaction” is one in\nwhich the broker does no more than execute the sale order and receive the usual\nand customary commission. Neither the broker nor the selling person can solicit\nor arrange for the sale order. In addition, the selling person or member of the\nBoard of Directors must not pay any fee or commission other than to the broker.\nA “market maker” includes a specialist permitted to act as a dealer, a dealer acting\nin the position of a block positioner, and a dealer who holds himself out as being\nwilling to buy and sell Company common stock for his own account on a regular\nand continuous basis.\n• :/ $’,+&/.’(#//;5$’8$29*1 A notice of the sale (a Form 144) must be filed with the\nSEC at the time of the sale. Brokers generally have internal procedures for\nexecuting sales under Rule 144, and will assist you in completing the Form 144 and\nin complying with the other requirements of Rule 144.\n15\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nIf you are subject to Rule 144, you must instruct your broker who handles trades in\nCompany securities to follow the brokerage firm’s Rule 144 compliance procedures in connection\nwith all trades.\nVII. Execution and Return of Certification of Compliance\nAfter reading this Policy, all officers, directors, and employees should execute and return\nto the Company’s Compliance Officer the Certification of Compliance form attached hereto as\n“Attachment B.”\n16\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg. Corporation 12-12-2022 11:51\nInsider Trading Compliance Policy\nAttachment A\nShort-Swing Profit Rule Section 16(b) Checklist\nNote: ANY combination of PURCHASE AND SALE or SALE AND PURCHASE within six\nmonths of each other by an officer, director, or 10% stockholder (or any family member living in\nthe same household or certain affiliated entities) results in a violation of Section 16(b), and the\n“profit” must be recovered by Virco Mfg. Corporation (the “Company”). It makes no difference\nhow long the shares being sold have been held or, for officers and directors, that you were an\ninsider for only one of the two matching transactions. The highest priced sale will be matched\nwith the lowest priced purchase within the six-month period.\nSales\nIf a sale is to be made by an officer, director, or 10% stockholder (or any family member\nliving in the same household or certain affiliated entities):\n1. Have there been any purchases by the insider (or family members living in the\nsame household or certain affiliated entities) within the past six months?\n2. Have there been any option grants or exercises not exempt under Rule 16b-3\nwithin the past six months?\n3. Are any purchases (or nonexempt option exercises) anticipated or required within\nthe next six months?\n4. Has a Form 4 been prepared?\nNote: If a sale is to be made by an affiliate of the Company, has a Form 144 been prepared\nand has the broker been reminded to sell pursuant to Rule 144?\nPurchases And Option Exercises\nIf a purchase or option exercise for Company stock is to be made:\n1. Have there been any sales by the insider (or family members living in the same\nhousehold or certain affiliated entities) within the past six months?\n2. Are any sales anticipated or required within the next six months (such as tax-\nrelated or year-end transactions)?\n3. Has a Form 4 been prepared?\nBefore proceeding with a purchase or sale, consider whether you are aware of material\nnonpublic information that could affect the price of the Company stock. All transactions in the\nCompany’s securities by officers and directors must be precleared by contacting the Company’s\nCompliance Officer or Corporate Controller.\n17\nUS-DOCS\\136134382.3 Virco Mfg.
