These latest enhancements include video doorbells, cameras, smoke detectors, smoke/CO detectors, and various sensors, along with the newly introduced wireless and hardwire takeover modules, models PRETROFIT and PHW8RETRO, respectively.\n\nDesigned to save dealers time and costs, these new modules allow seamless integration of existing security components into the advanced Prima system, providing the latest RMR-services, user interface, and app functionality. The Prima Wireless Translator, model PRETROFIT, supports up to 64 existing wireless security sensors by translating common 345MHz wireless devices, such as 2GIG® and Honeywell® unencrypted sensors, for use in the 433MHz (encrypted) Prima system without replacing them.\n\nFor hardwired sensors, the PHW8RETRO module enables dealers to upgrade virtually any alarm system to the state-of-the-art Prima 7\" All-in-One Super Panel for security, video, and smart home applications. This cost-effective module allows the reuse of existing hardwire zones already in place, ensuring a smooth transition to the Prima system without the need for replacement equipment or labor expense.\n\nNAPCO's new retrofit solutions reinforce its commitment to providing cutting-edge, cost-effective upgrades for security professionals, ensuring their clients benefit from the latest in security technology.\n\nThe Full Prima by Napco Line, is now available in hundreds of Napco Distributor locations, for more information, ask at your local Napco Distributor, or contact Jim Pless, Napco Director of Sales for Security & Smart Home (c)631-942-4017, or our Regional Napco Sales Managers, and/or ask for a demo or free training, see schedule [https://www.napcosecurity.com/seminars](/seminars) or call 1.800.645.9445.\n\n_**About NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc.** NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc.

Joining its VP Aaron Black in Sales Management is the newly-promoted Rob Etmans, Director of Sales, succeeding the well-respected icon Scott Schramme, who retired earlier this month. Additionally, Gio Carillo has been appointed as the Napco Access Pro Regional Sales Manager for the Southeast Territory, based in Miami, covering Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, North & South Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.\n\nStephen Spinelli commented, \"This is an opportune moment for our new Access team to infuse fresh ideas and energy, perfectly aligned with Napco Access Pro's upcoming launch of several new access control products and platforms. They include the enterprise-level CA4K v1.2 release, now available, along with new integration partners such as intercoms and biometrics; and subsequently, the eagerly-anticipated cloud-based MVP Access systems, coming soon. Aaron's entire team will be eager and fully prepared to present these innovations and support our professional integrator channel and Napco Access Pro Dealer Program members. On a more personal note, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge Scott Schramme's invaluable contributions, dedication & expertise. The Company and I will certainly miss him, and we wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.\"\n\nFor more on NAPCO Access Pro products or dealer program visit us at [www.napcoaccesspro.com](https://napcoaccesspro.com/), or contact a local [Napco Access Pro Sales Rep](https://napcoaccesspro.com/contact-us), check our professional training schedule, or call NAPCO Headquarters 1.800.645.9445.\n\n_**About NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc.** NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc.
