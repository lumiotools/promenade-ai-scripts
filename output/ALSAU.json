The more effectively it can leverage these capabilities, the faster it should grow. However, this becomes harder the larger it becomes…\n\nIn our experience, successful start-ups grow quickly for three key reasons: they have strong teams with strong cultures; they move fast; and they have strong relationships with their clients and understand what’s important to them. Established businesses which start to slow down, do so for the same reasons but in reverse. As they scale they: compromise on their people and culture; become mired in legacy systems and bureaucratic processes; and lose touch with what’s important to their clients.\n\n**It is our belief that a business that can grow its capabilities without diluting the ‘start-up DNA’ that made it successful in the first place, is the one that is best positioned for long-term sustainable growth. It is for these reasons we remain relentlessly focused on being both ‘David _and_ Goliath’ as we grow.**\n\n### **Our start-up DNA…**\n\n## **Cultural Density**\n\n**Providing an exceptional community full of opportunity, that inspires our team to expel discretionary energy and go further than our peers.**\n\n## **Operational Agility**\n\n**Reducing complexity and complacency as we scale to provide a low friction and efficient experience for our clients and team.**\n\n## **Client Centricity**\n\n**Scaling a high-performing yet client-centric sales team that puts our clients’ needs first whilst seeking to better understand them.**\n\n### **+ Growing Capabilities**\n\n### £0.10.9bn\n\n**Market Capitalisation**\n\n### £33m£224m\n\n**Net Assets**\n\n### 1531,000+\n\n**Tech stack updates p.a.**\n\n### 70480\n\n**Employee Headcount**\n\n### 110\n\n**Global Offices**\n\n### 15\n\n**Distinct product offerings**\n\n### **= Long-term sustainable growth…**\n\n[View our live Share Price Data](https://www.alphagroup.com/investors/share-information/)\n\n[View our latest Announcements](https://www.alphagroup.com/investors/regulatory-news/)\n\n![](https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/c80ff5af)\n\nWe use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.

We have therefore chosen to recognise interest income on client cash balances as ‘Net Treasury Income – Client Funds’, not revenue. We share the blended average client balances and interest rates through our website on a quarterly basis, in order to provide a mechanism for stakeholders to model this interest income themselves.\n\n**Q3 2024**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £2.2bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.8%\n\n\n\n**Q2 2024**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £2.1bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.9%\n\n\n\n**Q1 2024**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £2.0bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 4.0%\n\n\n\n**Q4 2023**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £2.1bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.8%\n\n\n\n**Q3 2023**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £1.9bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.8%\n\n\n\n**Q2 2023**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £1.9bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 3.8%\n\n\n\n**Q1 2023**\n\n  * Blended average balance: £1.6bn\n  * Blended average interest rate: 2.8%\n\n\n\n## Client & Sector Concentrations\n\n### Sector Concentration\n\nFigures are updated on a bi-annual basis and show sectors that makeup 1% or more of the Group’s total revenue (last updated 30/06/2024).\n\nSector| % of revenue  \n---|---  \nFinancial Institutions| 39%  \nManufacturing non-food| 17%  \nWholesale| 8%  \nRetail| 7%  \nEngineering| 4%  \nTravel & Tourism| 4%  \nOther| 3%  \nPrimary Industry*| 2%  \nOnline Services| 2%  \nManufacturing Food & Drink| 2%  \nImport/Export| 2%  \nTransport| 2%  \nConsulting Services| 1%  \nLogistics| 1%  \nMedia| 1%  \nConstruction| 1%  \nResearch & Development| 1%  \nTelecommunications| 1%  \n  \n### Top 20 Client FX Exposures\n\nFigures are updated on a bi-annual basis and show Alpha’s top 20 client FX exposures, represented as a % of the forward book (30/06/2024).\n\nCurrency Pair| % of forward book  \n---|---  \nEURUSD| 4.08%  \nGBPEUR| 3.12%  \nGBPUSD| 2.08%  \nGBPUSD| 1.97%  \nEURUSD| 1.92%  \nEURUSD| 1.76%  \nUSDCAD| 1.45%  \nEURUSD| 1.30%  \nEURUSD| 1.27%  \nEURUSD| 1.22%  \nEURUSD| 1.21%  \nGBPEUR| 1.20%  \nEURUSD| 1.18%  \nUSDBRL| 0.97%  \nAUDUSD| 0.96%  \nEURUSD| 0.95%  \nEURPLN| 0.87%  \nEURUSD| 0.84%  \nEURUSD| 0.82%  \nEURUSD| 0.82%  \n  \n![](https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/c80ff5af)\n\nWe use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.

This dynamic, combined with the passion of our people, has enabled us to make a substantial and enduring difference to our clients, and deliver a growth story to match.\n\n![](https://www.alphagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Alpha-Home-We-are-high-tech-and-high-touch.jpg)\n\n# We’re half-human, half-digital.\n\nBoston Consulting Group wrote that “for a company to achieve its full potential, technology must be combined with the flexibility, adaptability and comprehensive experience of humans.” It’s a view we’ve shared since inception, and by blending human capabilities with new technologies, we continue to amplify innovation, service levels, efficiency, growth, and resilience.\n\n![](https://www.alphagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alpha-Investors-Diversified-1.jpg)\n\n# We’re diversified.\n\nWe provide an array of solutions across a variety of sectors and geographies, with clients in over 50 countries and 30 sectors. As a result, we’ve grown strongly and profitably every year since inception, even in the most challenging macro-environments.\n\n![](https://www.alphagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alpha-Investment-Case-Well-Capitalised.jpg)![](https://www.alphagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alpha-Investment-Case-Well-Capitalised-Mobile-1500x1859.jpg)\n\n# We’re well–capitalised.\n\nProfitable revenue growth and strong cash conversion means we have a healthy and growing cash position. This enables us to capitalise on future investment opportunities and provide more attractive terms versus our competitors, without the need for further external investment.\n\n![](https://www.alphagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alpha-Investors-Investment-Case-Collectively-Owned-1.jpg)![](https://www.alphagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alpha-Investors-Investment-Case-Collectively-Owned-Mobile.jpg)\n\n# We’re collectively-owned.\n\nOur unique partnership structure means that everyone that works at Alpha has the opportunity to own equity in the business, with circa 100 employees already shareholders. This collective ownership has been key to creating an intrapreneurial, high-performance environment that drives our unique growth story.\n\n![](https://www.alphagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alpha-Investors-Investment-Case-David-and-Goliath-5.jpg)![](https://www.alphagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alpha-Investors-Investment-Case-David-and-Goliath-Mobile-1500x1720.jpg)\n\n# We’re both David and Goliath.\n\nDespite being an established FTSE 250 business, we remain relentlessly focused on retaining the same levels of operational agility and client-centricity we had when we first started in 2009. This dynamic of being _both_ David and Goliath is key to maintaining an effective and scalable business model and outperforming our competition.\n\n![](https://www.alphagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alpha-Investors-Investment-Case-Getting-Started-2.jpg)\n\n# And we’re just getting started…\n\nWe estimate that we have captured less than 1% of our addressable market, with a runway that extends across 50 countries (and growing) as we expand into new geographies and products.\n\n[View our live Share Price Data](https://www.alphagroup.com/investors/share-information/)\n\n[View our latest Announcements](https://www.alphagroup.com/investors/regulatory-news/)\n\n![](https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/c80ff5af)\n\nWe use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.
