The year-on-year growth in both monthly transacting users2 and orders through the JD App maintained strong momentum, increasing by over 100% in the third quarter of 2024. Optimization to customer experience also fueled the growth in repeat purchase rate. For Dada NOW3, we continued to strengthen our partnerships with chain merchants and further enhanced delivery service quality, contributing to a 46% year-over-year increase in revenue for the first nine months. Going forward, we will continue to execute our quality-focused approach prioritizing customer experience and service excellence to create long-term value for customers, business partners, delivery riders, and beyond.”\n\n“We are pleased to have delivered solid results this quarter with sequentially accelerated growth in order volume and continuing improvements in operating efficiency,” said Mr. Henry Jun Mao, Chief Financial Officer of Dada. “We are confident that our focus on enriching supply, optimizing service, and strengthening mindshare for our brand will lay a solid foundation for sustainable growth in the future. Meanwhile, Dada NOW continued to experience meaningful year-over-year growth in revenue, primarily driven by the momentum in our chain merchant business. Additionally, as a result of our high-quality development strategy and ongoing efficiency optimization, our GAAP and non-GAAP net loss margins4 narrowed by 4.1 and 3.7 percentage points quarter over quarter, respectively.”\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Total net revenues** were RMB2,429.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB2,621.8 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nBeginning with the second quarter of 2024, the Company changed the presentation of disaggregated revenues to better reflect its lines of business. The table below sets forth the disaggregation of revenues for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, with prior period financial results retrospectively recast to conform to current period presentation.\n\n**For the three months ended**| **For the nine months ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2023**| **June****30, 2024**| **September 30, 2024**| **YoY%****Change**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 30, 2024**| **YoY%****Change**  \n**(RMB in thousands,** **except percentage data)**  \n**Net revenues**  \n**JD NOW**  \nCommission fee| 397,528| 371,006| 331,719| (16.6| )%| 1,242,572| 1,126,471| (9.3| )%  \nOnline advertising and marketing services| 480,344| 128,805| 66,392| (86.2| )%| 1,705,886| 558,040| (67.3| )%  \nFulfillment services and others| 662,408| 412,637| 532,100| (19.7| )%| 1,994,765| 1,436,686| (28.0| )%  \n**Subtotal**| **1,540,280**| **912,448**| **930,211**| **(39.6**| **)%**| **4,943,223**| **3,121,197**| **(36.9**| **)%**  \n**Dada NOW**  \nIntra-city delivery services| 978,045| 1,236,598| 1,321,809| 35.1| %| 2,484,075| 3,602,859| 45.0| %  \nLast-mile delivery services| 63,851| 153,265| 129,222| 102.4| %| 211,868| 372,515| 75.8| %  \nOthers| 39,663| 47,596| 48,197| 21.5| %| 114,895| 134,530| 17.1| %  \n**Subtotal**| **1,081,559**| **1,437,459**| **1,499,228**| **38.6**| **%**| **2,810,838**| **4,109,904**| **46.2**| **%**  \n**Total**| **2,621,839**| **2,349,907**| **2,429,439**| **(7.3**| **)%**| **7,754,061**| **7,231,101**| **(6.7**| **)%**  \n  \n  * **Net revenues generated from JD NOW** was RMB930.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB1,540.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to a decrease in online advertising and marketing services revenues and a decrease in fulfillment services and other revenues as a result of the full rollout of delivery fee waiver program for orders exceeding RMB29 since February 2024.\n  * **Net revenues generated from Dada NOW** increased by 38.6% from RMB1,081.6 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB1,499.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, mainly driven by an increase in order volume of intra-city delivery services provided to various chain merchants.\n\n\n\n**Total costs and expenses** were RMB2,656.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB2,862.6 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n  * **Operations and support** costs were RMB1,731.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB1,711.2 million in the same quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in rider cost as a result of the increasing order volume of intra-city delivery services provided to various chain merchants, offset by a decrease in online advertising and marketing services costs.\n  * **Selling and marketing** expenses were RMB717.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB1,018.5 million in the same quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in promotional activities initiated by us on the JD NOW platform.\n  * **General and administrative** expenses were RMB107.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB29.1 million in the same quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit loss and litigation related expenses.\n  * **Research and development** expenses were RMB90.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB94.1 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Loss from operations** was RMB226.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB 210.5 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n**Non-GAAP loss from operations****5** was RMB86.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB52.4 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n**Net loss** was RMB197.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB166.0 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n**Non-GAAP net loss****6** was RMB59.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB9.2 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n**Basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share** was RMB0.19 in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB0.16 for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share****7** was RMB0.06 in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB0.01 for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Supplemental Information_**\n\n  * The following table sets forth the order volume and corresponding gross billings of our on-demand delivery services.\n\n**For the three months ended**| **For the nine months ended**  \n---|---  \n**September****30, 2023**| **June****30, 2024**| **September****30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 30, 2024**  \nNumber of orders delivered8 (in millions)| 477.7| 679.2| 648.4| 1,546.8| 1,881.9  \nGross billings9 (RMB in millions)| 2,323.1| 3,008.0| 3,098.2| 7,136.1| 8,635.3  \n  \n**_Environment, Social Responsibility and Governance (ESG)_**\n\n  * Dada further extended care to riders’ families. Following the launch of the “Riders’ Children Care Program” in the second quarter of 2023, Dada has been providing financial supports for the children of delivery riders’ who received offers from universities and colleges. In the third quarter of 2024, following the 2024 National College Entrance Examinations, Dada has sponsored multiple college-enrolled children, awarding scholarships to support them in pursuit of their dreams. These efforts aim to continually enhance the sense of belonging and well-being of the riders on our platform.\n  * Dada consistently cares for riders’ work and life through an enriched rider care system. In the third quarter of 2024, Dada launched various rider care activities in nearly 70 cities nationwide. In addition to material distribution primarily focused on summer-cooling supplies, Dada actively organized offline activities to enhance engagement with riders and other outdoor workers.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss the earnings at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, November 13, 2024 (9:30 a.m. Beijing time on Thursday, November 14, 2024).Please register in advance of the conference using the link provided below and dial in 10 minutes prior to the call.\n\nPRE-REGISTER LINK: [https://s1.c-conf.com/diamondpass/10043239-5g83af.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sCcnSJjdmTBGbSU-gxBx4GpNwa_IclMaX5INL2ulPpACzyLkEzX6IzfWKs3vDhVbN6-Catp3NYEsCJkL6SX1PpslTn9uYqGRocwmD-ZojUYvX9eapJ5q9s9GQVjoaqRaHTxZFcI6bJkhNDuBcfin-xySUOrbQdOGJX7Opcqvyf-OqFJcdjDzmWIYchG8ox1e)\n\nUpon registration, each participant will receive details for the conference call, including dial-in numbers, conference call passcode and a unique access PIN.

For example, the Company uses non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss), non-GAAP net margin, and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ordinary share as supplemental measures to review and assess its financial and operating performance. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations is income/(loss) from operations excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) is net income/(loss) excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and income tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets. Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income/(loss) as a percentage of total net revenues. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ordinary share is non-GAAP net income/(loss) divided by weighted average number of shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ordinary share.\n\nThe Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate the Company’s financial and operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income/(loss) enable the Company’s management to assess the Company’s financial and operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and income tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ assessment of the Company’s financial and operating performance.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and income tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company’s business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including peer companies, potentially limiting the comparability of their financial results to the Company’s. In light of the foregoing limitations, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, “Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains statements that may constitute “forward-looking” statements pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

JD NOW1 recorded over 100% year-on-year growth in both monthly transacting users2 and orders through the JD App in the second quarter of 2024. Dada NOW3 booked revenue growth north of 50% year on year in the first half of 2024. Looking ahead, we will strive to further execute our high-quality growth strategy while creating long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders, consumers, merchants and brand partners, delivery riders, and the society as a whole.”\n\n“In the second quarter of 2024, we remained committed to customer experience optimization and high-quality development,” said Mr. Henry Jun Mao, Chief Financial Officer of Dada. “We are pleased to see the strong growth momentum in JD NOW’s core metrics such as order volume and user base through the JD App in the quarter, which we believe will lead to long-term mindshare gains. Meanwhile, Dada NOW once again recorded impressive revenue growth, primarily thanks to the remarkable performance of our chain merchants business. GAAP and non-GAAP net loss margin4 improved by 1.2 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points quarter over quarter, respectively, as a result of our quality-focused efforts.”\n\n**_Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Total net revenues** were RMB2,349.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared with RMB2,596.8 million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nBeginning with the second quarter of 2024, the Company changed the presentation of disaggregated revenues to better reflect its lines of business.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in rider cost as a result of the increasing order volume of intra-city delivery services provided to various chain merchants, partially offset by a decrease in online advertising and marketing services costs.\n  * **Selling and marketing** expenses were RMB781.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared with RMB1,136.7 million in the same quarter of 2023.

For example, the Company uses non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss), non-GAAP net margin, and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ordinary share as supplemental measures to review and assess its financial and operating performance. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations is income/(loss) from operations excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) is net income/(loss) excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and income tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets. Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income/(loss) as a percentage of total net revenues. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ordinary share is non-GAAP net income/(loss) divided by weighted average number of shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ordinary share.\n\nThe Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate the Company’s financial and operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income/(loss) enable the Company’s management to assess the Company’s financial and operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and income tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ assessment of the Company’s financial and operating performance.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and income tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company’s business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including peer companies, potentially limiting the comparability of their financial results to the Company’s. In light of the foregoing limitations, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, “Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains statements that may constitute “forward-looking” statements pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Dada Now brands are in the process of upgrading to Dada NOW. 4 Please refer to “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for the definition of non-GAAP net margin. 5 Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations represents income/(loss) from operations excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions. 6 Non-GAAP net income/(loss) represents net income/(loss) excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and income tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets. 7 Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ordinary share is non-GAAP net income/(loss) divided by weighted average number of shares used in calculating non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ordinary share. 8 Number of orders delivered included orders directly placed through Dada NOW by merchants and individual senders, and orders fulfilled by Dada NOW for merchants on JD NOW. 9 Refer to the gross amount of services charges for abovementioned orders of the on-demand delivery services, net of value-added tax.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NzI2ZDM3MGUtNmQwYS00NWUzLTk3ZjMtMWNhNzIxYjkwOTljLTEyMDg4NTE=/tiny/Dada-Nexus-Limited.png)\n\n[ Print Page ]()\n\n**Print Page**\n\n[ RSS Feeds ](/rss-feeds)\n\n**RSS Feeds**\n\n[ Email Alerts ](/ir-resources/email-alerts)\n\n**Email Alerts**\n\n[ Contact IR ](/ir-resources/ir-contacts)\n\n**Contact IR**\n"
