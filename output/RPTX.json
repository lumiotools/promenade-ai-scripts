(“Repare” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RPTX), a leading clinical-stage precision oncology company, today announced a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) has been executed to advance the development of camonsertib as an anticancer agent in collaboration with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the US National Institutes of Health. \n\n“This partnership with the CTEP allows the research community to investigate the full clinical potential of camonsertib more easily and we believe it will provide additional clinical development catalysts for the program,” said Lloyd M. Segal, President and Chief Executive Officer of Repare. \n\nCamonsertib, a potential best-in-class oral small molecule ATR inhibitor, has demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in preclinical and clinical studies. Ongoing clinical trials in patients with metastatic solid tumors are evaluating the safety and efficacy of camonsertib as monotherapy and in combination with Repare’s PKMYT1 inhibitor, lunresertib, with chemotherapy and with palliative external beam radiotherapy. Camonsertib monotherapy has demonstrated an encouraging signal of prolonged progression-free survival in patients with ATM-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Recent Phase 1 results of camonsertib in combination with radiotherapy have shown benefit, including complete responses, in patients with ATM-altered tumors across various histologies. \n\nThe Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the NCI facilitates the development of promising cancer therapies by collaborating with researchers and industry partners. CTEP's mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. CTEP is interested in combination studies involving camonsertib and various aspects of radiation therapy, and translational studies to identify predictive biomarkers. \n\n**About Repare Therapeutics Inc.**\n\nRepare Therapeutics is a leading clinical-stage precision oncology company enabled by its proprietary synthetic lethality approach to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. The Company utilizes its genome-wide, CRISPR-enabled SNIPRx® platform to systematically discover and develop highly targeted cancer therapies focused on genomic instability, including DNA damage repair. The Company’s pipeline includes lunresertib (also known as RP-6306), a PKMYT1 inhibitor currently in Phase 1/2 clinical development; camonsertib (also known as RP-3500), a potential leading ATR inhibitor currently in Phase 1/2 clinical development; RP-1664, a Phase 1 PLK4 inhibitor; RP-3467, a Phase 1 Polθ ATPase inhibitor; as well as additional, undisclosed preclinical programs.

All statements in this press release other than statements of historical facts are “forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by words such as “aims,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “goal,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “possible,” “potential,” “seeks,” “will” and variations of these words or similar expressions that are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the design, progress and results of the Phase 1 clinical trial of camonsertib in combination with radiotherapy treatment for genotypically-selected cancers; and the Company’s future plans for clinical development of camonsertib; and the tolerability, efficacy and clinical progress of the Company’s product candidates, including camonsertib; and the benefits and ability to discover further targets and clinical candidates from the Company’s discovery platform.

(“Repare” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RPTX), a leading clinical-stage precision oncology company, today presented updated data highlighting the benefits of its individualized schedule for the management of anemia in the Phase 1 MYTHIC clinical trial treating patients with the combination of lunresertib, a first-in-class PKMYT1 inhibitor, and camonsertib, a potential best-in-class oral small molecule ATR inhibitor (lunre+camo). \n\nLunre+camo in the MYTHIC clinical trial ([NCT04855656](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT04855656&esheet=54140861&newsitemid=20241023356708&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT04855656&index=1&md5=f3f5a8466f7a1ac07391922f463da90e)) previously demonstrated promising clinical activity in molecularly selected patients across multiple tumor types. In this analysis, Repare followed patients for approximately nine months at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to assess the effectiveness of an individualized schedule. The analysis demonstrated a successful approach to mitigating mechanism-based anemia while maintaining clinical benefit. Further, Repare observed no thrombocytopenia of any grade nor serious neutropenia in these patients. \n\nDr. Martin Højgaard of Rigshospitalet, Denmark presented this [data](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reparerx.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F10%2FRepare-ENA2024.pdf&esheet=54140861&newsitemid=20241023356708&lan=en-US&anchor=data&index=2&md5=b81656accb90a4dd93980a8493f614b3) in a poster titled, “Individualized schedule improves rates and severity of anemia in patients treated with lunresertib, a PKMYT1 inhibitor, and camonsertib, an ATR inhibitor, in the Phase I MYTHIC study (NCT04855656)” at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR (ENA) Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, being held October 23-25, 2024 in Barcelona, Spain. \n\n“This individualized schedule in heavily pretreated patients with advanced cancers from our MYTHIC clinical trial met its goal of maintaining antitumor activity while reducing rates of grade 3 anemia,” said Maria Koehler, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Repare. “We believe that these data demonstrate a favorable and differentiated tolerability profile versus both current and emerging therapies. We look forward to sharing efficacy data from the gynecological cancer expansion cohort of the MYTHIC clinical trial in December 2024.” \n\n**Key Clinical Trial Findings:**\n\n  * The individualized schedule mitigated mechanism-based anemia based on entry hemoglobin observed in a minority of patients \n  * Overall clinical benefit was maintained after schedule change with generally maintained radiographic regressions and molecular responses: - Despite the change in schedule, deepening of target lesion regression was noted in some patients - After 9 weeks on therapy, there was no observed impact on Progression Free Survival (PFS) in patients who started on or switched to the schedule of 2 weeks on / 1 week off of treatment \n  * Dose optimization meaningfully reduced Grade 3 anemia (22.6% vs. 51.4%, previously) in all patients: - Baseline marrow function was the key reason for Grade 3 anemia as opposed to exposure to therapy - Baseline hemoglobin, prior therapies, and treatment intensity (weekly vs. 2 weeks on / 1 week off) predicted Grade 3 anemia frequency with lunre+camo - Anemia reduction was greatest in patients with baseline hemoglobin less than 11g/dL (Grade 3 anemia at week 12: 34% vs. 68%, previously; overall risk reduction: 58%) - Red blood cell transfusions (13% vs. 43%, previously), dose interruptions (13% vs. 23%) and dose reductions (6% vs. 17%) were also reduced with the new schedule - Other Grade 3 events were already uncommon (<5% incidence) and remained consistently low, regardless of schedule \n\n\n\n**About Repare Therapeutics Inc.**\n\nRepare Therapeutics is a leading clinical-stage precision oncology company enabled by its proprietary synthetic lethality approach to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics.
