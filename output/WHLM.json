BUSINESS\nDESCRIPTION OF THE WILHELMINA BUSINESS\nOverview\nThe primary business of Wilhelmina is fashion model management. The Company’s predecessor was founded in\n1967 by Wilhelmina Cooper, a renowned fashion model, and became one of the oldest, best known, and largest fashion model\nmanagement companies in the world. Headquartered in New York City, Wilhelmina has grown to include operations located\nin Los Angeles, Miami, and London, as well as a network of licensees. Wilhelmina provides traditional, full-service fashion\nmodel and talent management services, specializing in the representation and management of models, entertainers, athletes\nand other talent, to various clients, including retailers, designers, advertising agencies, print and electronic media, and catalog\ncompanies. The Company maintains a website at https://www.wilhelmina.com.\nThe Aperture division operates in New York, Los Angeles and Miami, representing actors and models, for film,\ntelevision, and commercials. Aperture also represents influencers for brand campaigns and endorsements.\nWilhelmina London Limited (“London”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilhelmina International, Inc., was acquired\nin January 2015. The London subsidiary establishes a footprint for the Company in Western Europe, provides a base of\noperations to service the Company’s European clients, and serves as a new talent development office for European models\nand artists.\nOrganization and Operating Divisions\nThe Company acquired the predecessor companies constituting its current primary business in 2008. The Company\nconducts its business through operating divisions and subsidiaries engaged in fashion model management and other\ncomplementary businesses. These business activities are focused on the following key areas:\n(cid:404) Fashion model and social media influencer management\n(cid:404) Celebrity management\n(cid:404) Licensing and branding associations\nFashion Model and Social Media Influencer Management\nWilhelmina is focused on providing fashion modeling talent and social media influencer services to clients such as\nadvertising agencies, branded consumer goods companies, fashion designers, Internet sites, retailers, department stores,\nproduct catalogs and magazine publications.\nThe fashion model/talent/influencer management industry can be divided into many subcategories, including\nadvertising campaigns, catalog/e-commerce, runway, showroom and editorial work. Advertising work involves modeling for\nadvertisements featuring consumer products such as cosmetics, clothing and other items to be placed in magazines and\n4\nnewspapers, on billboards and with other types of media. Catalog and e-commerce work involves modeling of products to be\nsold through promotional catalogs and Internet commerce sites. Runway work involves modeling at fashion shows, which\nprimarily take place in Paris, Milan, London and New York City. Showroom work involves on-site modeling of products at\nclient showrooms and other events and production “fit” work whereby a model serves as the sizing model for apparel items.\nEditorial work involves modeling for the cover and editorial sections of magazines and websites.\nClients pay for talent to appear in photo shoots for Internet sites, magazine features, print advertising, direct mail\nmarketing, and product catalogs, as well as to appear in runway shows to present new designer collections, fit modeling, and\non-location presentations and events. In addition, talent may also appear in film and television commercials. Wilhelmina\ndevelops and diversifies its talent portfolio through a combination of ongoing local, regional and international scouting and\ntalent-search efforts to source new talent, as well as cooperating with other agencies that represent talent.\nWithin its fashion model management business, Wilhelmina’s primary source of service revenue is from model fees\nand services charges paid by the client for bookings directly negotiated by the Company. The Company also receives\ncommissions paid on bookings by third-party agencies. Wilhelmina believes that its model fees, service charges and\ncommission rates are competitive with those of its principal competitors.\nWilhelmina’s fashion model management operations are organized into divisions called “boards,” each of which\nspecializes by the type of models it represents. Wilhelmina’s boards are generally described in the table below.\nBoard Name Location Target Market\nWomen NYC, LA, Miami, London High-end female fashion models\nMen NYC, LA, Miami, London High-end male fashion models\nDirect NYC, LA, Miami, London Established/commercial male/female fashion models\nCurve NYC, LA, Miami, London Full-figured female fashion models\nShowroom NYC, LA, Miami Live modeling and designer fit clothing modeling\nFitness NYC, LA, Miami Athletic models\nEach major board is headed by a director who manages the agents assigned to the board. The agents of each board\nact both as bookers (including promoting models, negotiating fees and contracting work) and as talent scouts/managers\n(including providing models with career and development guidance and helping them better market themselves). Although\nagents individually develop professional relationships with models, models are represented by a board collectively and not\nby a specific agent. Wilhelmina’s organization into boards enables Wilhelmina to provide clients with services tailored to\ntheir particular needs, to allow models to benefit from agents’ specialized experience in their particular markets, and to limit\nWilhelmina’s dependency on any specialty market or agent.\nMost senior agents are employed pursuant to employment agreements that include noncompetition provisions such\nas a prohibition from working with Wilhelmina’s models and clients for a certain period of time after the end of the agent’s\nemployment with Wilhelmina. Wilhelmina typically signs its models to three-year exclusive contracts, which it actively\nenforces.\nCelebrity Management\nWilhelmina’s Celebrity division seeks to secure endorsement and spokesperson work for celebrities from the worlds\nof sports, music and entertainment. The Celebrity division has two primary sources of revenue: (i) commissions paid by talent\nas a percentage of their gross earnings; and (ii) royalties or a service charge paid by clients. Wilhelmina’s Celebrity division\nmanagement works with emerging artists and established celebrity names to match them with leading fashion brands and\ncompanies.\nLicensing & Branding Associations\nWilhelmina Licensing, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary that collects third-party licensing fees in connection with\nthe licensing of the “Wilhelmina” name. Third-party licensees include leading fashion model agencies in local markets in the\nU.S. and internationally. The film and television business consists of occasional television syndication royalties and\nproduction series contracts. Also, from time to time, the Company conducts other events, such as model search contests, in\nan effort to expand the Wilhelmina brand and recruit talent.\n5\nCompetition\nThe fashion model/talent management business is highly competitive. New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami, as\nwell as London, Paris, and Milan, are considered the most important markets for the fashion talent management\nindustry. Most of the leading international firms are headquartered in New York City. Wilhelmina’s principal competitors\ninclude other large fashion model management businesses in the U.S., including IMG Models, Elite Model Management,\nFord Models, Inc., DNA Model Management, NEXT Model Management, The Lions Model Management, The Society\nManagement, Women 360 Management, and New York Model Management. However, Wilhelmina is the only publicly-\nowned fashion talent management company in the world.\nCompetition also includes foreign agencies and smaller U.S. agencies in local markets that recruit local talent and\ncater to local market needs. Several of the larger fashion talent firms operate offices in multiple cities and countries or have\nchosen to partner with local or foreign agencies.\nThe Company believes that its sources of revenue, mainly generated from commissions and service charges, are\ncomparable to those of its principal competitors. Therefore, for the Company to obtain a competitive advantage, it must\ndevelop and maintain a deep pool of talent and deliver high quality service to its clients. The Company believes that through\nits scouting efforts, name recognition, and licensing network, it is able to recruit a deeper pool of talent relative to its\ncompetitors. These recruitment tools, coupled with the broad range of fashion boards available to the Company’s talent,\nenable the Company to develop talent and generate a broader range of revenues relative to its principal competitors. While a\nbroad range of talent and boards provides a level of stability to the business, certain talent may be more inclined to work with\na boutique agency that may appear to tailor more specifically to their needs.\nFor more than 55 years, Wilhelmina and its predecessors have created long-standing client relationships and business\nactivities related to the fashion model management business that provide exposure to diverse markets and demographics. The\nCompany has also developed a professional workforce with years of talent management experience.\nClients and Customers\nAs of December 31, 2023, Wilhelmina represented a roster of approximately 1,600 active models and talent. Wilhelmina’s\nactive models include Ana Maria Figueroa, Yumi Nu, Francisco Lachowski, Daniel Shin, Ana Cristina, Olga Sherer, Serena\nMarques, Valentine Charrasse, Douglas Dillon, Fernando Cabral, Hella Tall, Asya Rosh, Francisco Henriques, Aubrey Hill,\nDaniel Puig, Joshuah Melnick, Noah Brown, Sofia Resing, Lamich Kirabo, Penny Lane, Africa Perez, Carmen Fozzard,\nBojana Krsmanovi(cid:252), Mitchell Slaggert, Anne de Paula, Jan Baiboon, Ottawa Efoe, Rainer Andreesen, Erik Van Gils, Kate\nKing, Malik Lindo, Malcolm Jackson, Haejin Lee, Moon Young, Isabela Grutman, Sabey Dantsira, Lauren Auerbach,\nDavidson Obennebo, Sasha Melnychuk, Armando Cabral, Jennae Quisenberry, Vanessa Cruz, Pure, Akito Mizutani, Nayara\nOliveira, Fernando Lindez, Dachuan Jin, Claudio Monteiro, and Nathan Owens.\nWilhelmina serves approximately 2,800 external clients. Wilhelmina’s customer base is highly diversified, with no\none customer accounting for more than 3% of overall gross revenues. The top 100 clients of Wilhelmina together accounted\nfor approximately 43.1% of overall revenues during 2023.\nGovernmental Regulations\nCertain jurisdictions in which Wilhelmina operates, such as California and Florida, require that companies maintain\na Talent Agency License in order to engage in the “talent agency” business. The talent agency business is generally considered\nthe business of procuring engagements or any employment or placement of a talent, where the talent performs in his or her\nartistic capacity. Where required, the Wilhelmina subsidiaries operating in these jurisdictions maintain Talent Agency\nLicenses issued by those jurisdictions.\nTrends and Opportunities\nThe Company expects that the combination of Wilhelmina’s main operating base in New York City, the industry’s\ncapital, with the depth and breadth of its talent pool and client roster and its diversification across various talent management\nsegments, together with its geographical reach, should make Wilhelmina’s operations more resilient to industry changes and\neconomic swings than those of many of the smaller firms operating in the industry.\n6\nWith total annual advertising expenditures on major media (newspapers, magazines, television, cinema, outdoor and\nInternet) estimated to have exceeded $260 billion in recent years, North America is the world’s largest advertising\nmarket. For the fashion talent management industry, including Wilhelmina, advertising expenditures on television, Internet,\nmagazines, and outdoor are of particular relevance.\nIn recent periods, traditional retail clients in the fashion and beauty industry have had increased competition from\ndigital, social, and new media, reducing their budgets for advertising and model talent. Wilhelmina reviews the mix of talent\nand resources available to best operate in this changing environment.\nAlthough Wilhelmina has a large and diverse client base, it is not immune to global economic conditions. The\nCompany closely monitors economic conditions, client spending, and other industry factors and continually evaluates\nopportunities to increase its market share and further expand its geographic reach. There can be no assurance as to the effects\non Wilhelmina of current or future economic circumstances, client spending patterns, client creditworthiness, and other\ndevelopments and whether, or to what extent, Wilhelmina’s efforts to respond to them will be effective.\nStrategy\nManagement’s strategy is to increase value to shareholders through the following initiatives:\n• increase Wilhelmina’s brand awareness among advertisers and potential talent;\n• expand the women’s high end fashion board;\n• expand the Aperture division’s representation in commercials, film, and television;\n• expand social media influencer and celebrity representation;\n• expand the Wilhelmina network through strategic geographic market development; and\n• promote model search contests and events and partner on media projects (television, film, books, etc.).\nThe Company makes use of digital technology to effectively connect with clients and talent, utilizing video\nconferencing and other digital tools to best position our team to identify opportunities to grow the careers of the talent we\nrepresent and expand our business. The Company has made significant investments in technology, infrastructure, and\npersonnel, to support our clients and talent.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 87 full time employees, 47 of whom were located in New York City,\n11 of whom were located at Wilhelmina’s Miami office, 17 of whom were located at Wilhelmina’s Los Angeles office, 10\nof whom were located at Wilhelmina’s London office and two of whom were located at the corporate headquarters in Dallas.\nTRADEMARKS AND LICENSING\nThe “Wilhelmina” brand is essential to the success and competitive position of the Company. The “Wilhelmina”\ntrademark is vital to the licensing business because licensees pay for the right to use the trademark. The Company has invested\nsignificant resources in the “Wilhelmina” brands in order to obtain the public recognition that these brands currently\nenjoy. Wilhelmina relies upon domestic and international trademark laws, license agreements and nondisclosure agreements\nto protect the “Wilhelmina” brand name used in its business. Trademarks registered in the U.S. have a duration of ten years\nand are generally subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period on continued use and appropriate application.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNot applicable to smaller reporting company.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n7\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management\nprogram includes a cybersecurity incident response plan.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is designed to identify, assess, and manage the cybersecurity risks that\nare relevant to our business and is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common\nmethodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to\nother legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n• risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information,\nproducts, services, and our broader enterprise information technology environment;\n• managing (i) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (ii) our security controls, and (iii) our response to\ncybersecurity incidents;\n• the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our\nsecurity controls;\n• carrying cyber risk insurance that provides protection (as specified in the applicable policies) against certain\npotential costs and losses arising from a cybersecurity incident;\n• regular communications to all employees from management informing of the types of threats to be aware of\nand procedure to follow when a risk has been identified;\n• requiring employees, as well as contractors who have access to our systems or the data of our employees or\ncustomers, to treat information as confidential.\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity\nincidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business\nstrategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We have not currently engaged any third party service providers to\nsupport, manage, or supplement our cybersecurity processes.\nGOVERNANCE\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of increasing focus for the\nCompany’s Board of Directors and management.\nThe Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of risks from\ncybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee periodically receives updates from management and our third party IT support\nspecialists of our cybersecurity threat risk management and mitigation strategies covering topics such as data security posture\nand potentially material cybersecurity threat risks or incidents, as well as the steps management has taken to respond to such\nrisks. In such sessions, the Audit Committee generally receives information describing current and emerging material\ncybersecurity threat risks, and describing the company’s plans to mitigate those risks, and discusses such matters with our\nthird party IT support specialists and other members of senior management. Potentially material cybersecurity threat risks are\nalso considered during separate Board discussions of important matters like enterprise risk management.\nWhile the Audit Committee reviews and oversees the Company’s information security efforts, senior leadership is\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of cybersecurity risk and the design and implementation of policies, processes\nand procedures to identify and mitigate this risk. These members of management are informed about and monitor the\nprevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation\nin, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident\nresponse plan.\n8\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations comparing the calendar\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. This section should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and the notes thereto that are incorporated herein by reference and the other financial information\nincluded herein and the notes thereto.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023\nCOMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022\nIn addition to net income, the key financial indicators that the Company reviews to monitor its business are revenues,\noperating expenses, and cash flows.\nThe Company analyzes revenue by reviewing the mix of revenues generated by the different “boards,” each a\nspecific division of the fashion model management operations which specializes by the type of model it represents, by\ngeographic locations and from significant clients. Within its fashion model management business, Wilhelmina’s primary\nsource of service revenue is from model fees and service charges paid by the client for bookings directly negotiated by the\nCompany. The Company also receives commissions paid on bookings by third-party agencies. See “Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates - Revenue Recognition.”\nWilhelmina provides professional services. Therefore, salary and service costs represent the largest part of the\nCompany’s operating expenses. Salary and service costs are comprised of payroll and related costs and travel, meals, and\nentertainment (“T&E”) to deliver the Company’s services and to enable new business development activities.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Statements of Income\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nService revenues .............................................................................................................. 17,182 17,750\nLicense fees and other income ........................................................................................ 30 30\nTOTAL REVENUES .................................................................................................... 17,212 17,780\nSalaries and service costs ................................................................................................ 11,481 10,907\nOffice and general expenses ............................................................................................ 3,830 3,168\nAmortization and depreciation ........................................................................................ 208 193\nCorporate overhead ......................................................................................................... 965 1,093\nOPERATING INCOME ............................................................................................... 728 2,419\nOPERATING MARGIN ............................................................................................... 4.2% 13.6%\nForeign exchange (gain) loss ........................................................................................... 106 (164)\nInterest income ................................................................................................................

The revenue decrease of 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwhen compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to decreased commissions from model bookings.\nLicense Fees and Other Income\nLicense fees and other income include franchise revenues from independently owned model agencies that use the\nWilhelmina trademark and various services provided by the Company. License fees were unchanged for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSalaries and Service Costs\nSalaries and service costs consist of payroll related costs and travel and entertainment expenses required to deliver\nthe Company’s services to its clients and talents. The 5.3% increase in salaries and service costs for the year ended December\n31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to personnel hires and payroll changes to\nbetter align Wilhelmina staffing with the needs of each office and geographical region.\nOffice and General Expenses\nOffice and general expenses consist of office and equipment rents, advertising and promotion, insurance expenses,\nadministration and technology cost. During the year ended December 31, 2023, office and general expenses increased 20.9%\nwhen compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased legal expense, rent expense, utilities,\ncomputer expenses, and other office related expenses.\nAmortization and Depreciation\nAmortization and depreciation expense is incurred with respect to certain assets, including computer hardware,\nsoftware, office equipment, furniture and finance leases. Amortization and depreciation expense increased by 7.8% for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased depreciation of\ncapitalized furniture and leasehold assets at the Company’s New York City office. Fixed asset purchases (mostly related to\nfurniture, leasehold improvements, and computer equipment) totaled approximately $165 thousand in 2023 and $268\nthousand in 2022.\nCorporate Overhead\nCorporate overhead expenses include director and executive officer compensation, legal, audit and professional fees,\ncorporate office rent and travel. Corporate overhead decreased by 11.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023, when\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to costs related to the filing of two SEC restatement filings in\n2022 that did not recur in 2023.\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\nOperating income was $0.7 million and operating margin was 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared\nto operating income of $2.4 million and operating margin of 13.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022. These declines\nwere primarily the result of the increase in operating expenses and reduction in revenues.\nForeign Currency Exchange\nThe Company realized a loss of $106 thousand from foreign currency exchange during the year ended December\n31, 2023, compared to a gain of $164 thousand from foreign currency exchange during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nForeign currency gain and loss is due to fluctuations in currencies from Great Britain, Europe, and Latin America.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable interest earned on United States\ntreasury securities. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.\n12\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to\naccrued interest on finance leases. See, “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nIncome before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes decreased to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $2.6\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The lower pre-tax income in 2023 was primarily due to lower operating\nincome.\nIncome Taxes\nGenerally, the Company’s combined effective tax rate is high relative to reported net income as a result of foreign\ntaxes and income being attributable to certain states in which it operates. The Company operates in three states which have\nrelatively high tax rates: California, New York, and Florida. In addition, foreign taxes in the United Kingdom related to our\nLondon office are not deductible for U.S. federal tax purposes. The Company had income tax expense of $0.3 million in 2023\ncompared to $1.0 million of income tax benefit in 2022.\nThe income tax benefit in 2022 was primarily the result of the full release of a previous $1.5 million valuation\nallowance against deferred tax assets. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and\nnegative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. In connection with its assessment for 2022,\nmanagement determined that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that it was more likely than not that all deferred tax\nassets were realizable. This evidence included three years of cumulative pretax income, excluding nonrecurring items. The\nCompany will continue to assess the evidence used to determine the need for a valuation allowance and may reinstate the\nvaluation allowance in future periods if warranted by changes in estimated future income and other factors.\nNet Income\nThe Company had net income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of\n$3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the decrease in operating\nincome and the release of the previous valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in 2022.\nGross Billings\nGross billings is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the gross amount billed to customers on behalf of\nits clients (models and talent) for services performed. Gross billings decreased 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwhen compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to decreased Aperture division bookings. See page 14\nfor more information regarding non-GAAP financial measures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s cash balance decreased to $6.1 million at December 31, 2023 from $12.0 million at December 31,\n2022. The cash balance decreased primarily as a result of $0.7 million net cash provided by operating activities, $6.7 million\ncash used in investing activities, $0.1 million cash used in financing activities, and the $0.2 million effect of exchange rate\non cash flow.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $0.7 million was primarily the result of decreases in accounts receivable\nand right of use assets and an increase in deferred income taxes, partially offset by decreases in amounts due to models, lease\nliabilities and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The $6.7 million cash used in investing activities was attributable to\npurchases of short term investments and property and equipment, including furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements,\nsoftware and computer equipment, partially offset by maturities of short term investments. The $63 thousand cash used in\nfinancing activities was attributable to payments on finance leases.\nThe Company’s primary liquidity needs are for working capital associated with performing services under its client\ncontracts. Generally, the Company incurs significant operating expenses with payment terms shorter than its average\ncollections on billings. Based on budgeted and year-to-date cash flow information, management believes that the Company\nhas sufficient liquidity to meet its projected operational expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve\nmonths and beyond.\n13\nImportant Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain\nnon-GAAP financial measures provide users of the Company's financial information with additional useful information in\nevaluating operating performance. The Company considers Gross Billings, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Corporate\nEBITDA to be important measures of performance because they are key operating metrics of the Company's business. These\nmetrics are used by management in its planning and budgeting processes, to monitor and evaluate its financial and operating\nresults, and to provide stockholders and potential investors with a means to evaluate the Company's financial and operating\nresults against other companies within the Company's industry.\nGross Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers on behalf of its models and talent for services\nperformed. The Company calculates Gross Billings as total revenue plus model costs, which includes amounts owed to talent,\nincluding taxes required to be withheld and remitted directly to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and\nrelated costs such as those paid for photography. The Company calculates EBITDA as net income plus interest income,\ninterest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company calculates “Adjusted\nEBITDA” as EBITDA plus foreign exchange gain/loss, share-based payment expense and certain significant non-recurring\nitems that the Company may include from time to time. The Company calculates “Pre-Corporate EBITDA” as Adjusted\nEBITDA plus corporate overhead expense, which includes director compensation, securities laws compliance costs, audit\nand professional fees, and other public company costs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the\nCompany's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in\nnon-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company's financial position, results of\noperations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual and future financial condition\nand performance. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly\nfrom methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures\npresented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.\nGross Billings\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure Gross Billings to GAAP total revenues,\nwhich the Company believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nTotal revenues ................................................................................................................. $ 17,212 $ 17,780\nModel costs ..................................................................................................................... 48,724 48,906\nGross Billings .................................................................................................................. $ 65,936 $ 66,686\nModel costs include amounts owed to talent, including taxes required to be withheld and remitted directly to taxing\nauthorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and related costs such as those paid for photography.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pre-Corporate EBITDA\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and\nPre-Corporate EBITDA to GAAP net income, which the Company believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nNet income ...................................................................................................................... $ 433 $ 3,529\nInterest income ................................................................................................................

The preparation of these consolidated financial\nstatements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,\ncosts, and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different\naccounting estimates, and in other instances, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period\nto period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent\nthat there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\nThe following items require significant estimation or judgement. For additional information about our accounting\npolicies, refer to “Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded herewith.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wilhelmina and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All\nsignificant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”). ASC 606 establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the\ntransfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in\nexchange for those goods or services.\nOur revenues are derived primarily from fashion model bookings, and representation of social media influencers\nand actors for commercials, film, and television. Our performance obligations are primarily satisfied at a point in time when\nthe talent has completed the contractual requirements.\nA contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when,\nor as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The performance obligations for most of the Company’s core modeling bookings\nare satisfied on the day of the event, and the “day rate” total fee is agreed in advance when the customer books the model for\na particular date. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price.\nWe report service revenues on a net basis, which represents gross amounts billed net of amounts owed to talent,\nincluding taxes required to be withheld and remitted directly to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and\nrelated costs such as those paid for photography. The Company typically enters into contractual agreements with models\nunder which the Company is obligated to pay talent upon collection of fees from the customer.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a net basis, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross\namounts billed to customers, inclusive of model costs. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models\nappear large relative to total revenue.\nAmounts billed that have not yet met the applicable revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue\nwithin accrued expenses and the related talent costs are recorded as contract liability.\nShare Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value as calculated by\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight line basis as an expense over the requisite service\nperiod, which is generally the vesting period. The determination of the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant\nusing an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and\nsubjective variables. These variables include the estimated volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and\nprojected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, estimated forfeitures, and expected dividends.\n15\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, the United Kingdom, and numerous local jurisdictions.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences\nto the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Unused tax loss\ncarry-forwards are reviewed at each reporting date and a valuation allowance is established if it is doubtful we will generate\nsufficient future taxable income to utilize the loss carry-forwards.\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, we take into account whether additional taxes,\ninterest, or penalties may be due. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our income taxes, we can provide\nno assurance that the final tax outcome will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome is different\nthan the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such\ndetermination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nCash, Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments with\nmaturities of three months or less.\nShort Term Investments\nShort-term investments with maturities over three and up to twelve months are recorded in Short-term investments.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are accounted for at net realizable value, do not bear interest, and are short-term in nature. The\nCompany maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect on accounts\nreceivable. Based on management’s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge\nto earnings and a credit to the allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection\nefforts are written off through a charge to the allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company generally does\nnot require collateral.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a basis net of model costs, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount\nof gross amounts billed to customers inclusive of model costs. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to\nmodels appear large relative to total revenue.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Testing\nThe Company performs impairment testing at least annually and more frequently if events and circumstances\nindicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds\nthe reporting unit’s fair value. The Company sometimes utilizes an independent valuation specialist to assist with the\ndetermination of fair value. In accordance with ASU 2017-03, only a one-step quantitative impairment test is performed,\nwhereby a goodwill impairment loss will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value.\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess\nof the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill.\nWhenever events or circumstances change, entities have the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the\nlikelihood of goodwill impairment. If impairment is deemed more likely than not, management would perform the goodwill\nimpairment test. Otherwise, the goodwill impairment test is not required. In assessing the qualitative factors, the Company\nassesses relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit. The\nidentification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount\ninvolve significant judgments and assumptions. The judgment and assumptions include the identification of macroeconomic\nconditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, Company specific events and share price\ntrends, an assessment of whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively, and the\nmagnitude of any such impact.\nThe Company evaluates indefinite lived trademark and trade name intangible assets for impairment using the relief\nfrom royalty method. This valuation approach requires that the Company make a number of assumptions to estimate fair\nvalue, including projections of future revenues, royalty rates, tax rates, discount rates, and other relevant variables. The\n16\nprojections in this model are updated annually and will change over time based on historical performance and changing\nbusiness conditions. If the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for\nthe excess amount.\nITEM 7A.

F-10\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nof Wilhelmina International, Inc. and Subsidiaries:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Wilhelmina International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income,\nshareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as\nthe “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then\nended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthese financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control\nover financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial\nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures\nthat are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nTrademarks and Trade Name Impairment Assessment\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company's trademarks and trade name are tested for impairment at\nleast annually. The Company elected not to perform the qualitative assessment (Step 0) in connection with testing its\ntrademarks and trade name for impairment. Instead, a quantitative assessment (Step 1) was performed using the royalty-\nrelief method, which is based upon projected revenues and estimated royalty and discount rates. The determination of the\nfair value of the trademarks and trade name requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to\nforecasts of future revenues and royalty and discount rates. As disclosed by management, changes in these assumptions could\nhave a significant impact on the fair value of the trademarks and trade name and the amount of any impairment expense\nrecognized.\nWe identified the Step 1 trademarks and trade name impairment assessment as a critical audit matter, as auditing\nmanagement’s judgments regarding forecasts for future revenue and royalty and discount rates involve a high degree of\nsubjectivity and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve our external fair value specialists.\nF-2\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the critical audit matter included the following:\n(cid:404) We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls over the estimates and\nassumptions used by management in the determination of the fair value of the trademarks and trade name including\ncontrols addressing:\no Review and approval of key assumptions and inputs, including financial projections, projected growth rates of\nrevenues, capitalization, royalty and discount rates and peer information used in the model.\no The completeness and accuracy of the model.\n(cid:404) We performed, with the assistance of an auditor employed valuation specialist, substantive procedures on\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the trademarks and trade names\nincluding:\no We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of future revenues by comparing these forecasts to\nhistorical operating results and industry data, and considered whether such assumptions were consistent with\nevidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\no We tested the mathematical accuracy of the model, as well as the completeness and accuracy of the information used\nin it.\no We evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology used, as well as the capitalization, royalty and discount rate\nassumptions.\no We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s royalty rate, net of support costs rate, by developing an\nindependent range using guideline royalty rate data.\no We performed a retrospective review of the Company’s prior year forecasted revenue using the current year’s actual\noperating results and considered management’s ability to reasonably forecast and project revenue without bias.\no We performed a sensitivity analysis of the royalty and discount rates to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the\ntrademarks and trade name that would result from such changes in the assumptions.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2023.\n/s/ Bodwell Vasek Wells DeSimone LLP\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 26, 2024\nF-3\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and board of directors\nof Wilhelmina International, Inc. and Subsidiaries:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Wilhelmina International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the\n\"Company\") as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income,\nshareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as\nthe \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows\nfor the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control\nover financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\nor complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nF-4\nTrademarks and Trade Name Impairment Assessment - Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's trademarks and trade name are tested for\nimpairment at least annually. The Company elected not to perform the qualitative assessment (Step 0) in connection with\ntesting its trademarks and trade name for impairment. Instead, a quantitative assessment (Step 1) was performed using the\nroyalty-relief method, which is based upon projected revenues and estimated royalty and discount rates. The determination\nof the fair value of the trademarks and trade name requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related\nto forecasts of future revenues and royalty and discount rates. As disclosed by management, changes in these assumptions\ncould have a significant impact on the fair value of the trademarks and trade name and the amount of any impairment expense\nrecognized.\nWe identified the Step 1 trademarks and trade name impairment assessment as a critical audit matter, as auditing\nmanagement’s judgments regarding forecasts for future revenue and royalty and discount rates involve a high degree of\nsubjectivity and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the critical audit matter included the following:\n(cid:404) We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls over the estimates and\nassumptions used by management in the determination of the fair value of the trademarks and trade name including\ncontrols addressing:\no Management’s review and approval of key assumptions and inputs, including financial projections, projected\ngrowth rates of revenues, capitalization, royalty and discount rates and peer information used in the model.\no The completeness and accuracy of the model.\n(cid:404) We performed, with the assistance of an auditor employed valuation specialist, substantive procedures on management’s\nestimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the trademarks and trade name including:\no We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of future revenues by comparing these forecasts to\nhistorical operating results and industry growth, and considered whether such assumptions were consistent with\nevidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\no We tested the mathematical accuracy of the model, as well as the completeness and accuracy of the information\nused in it.\no We evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology used, as well as the capitalization, royalty and discount rate\nassumptions.\no We prepared a benchmarking analysis comparing the royalty rate used in the model with third party licensing\ntransactions and developed an independent estimate using an implied royalty rate based on a profit split method.\no We performed sensitivity analysis of the significant assumptions (i.e. projected revenues, royalty and discount rates)\nto evaluate the changes in the fair value of the trademarks and trade name that would result from such changes in\nthe assumptions.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor from 2012 to 2022.\n/s/ Baker Tilly US, LLP\nNew York, New York\nMarch 22, 2023\nF-5\nWILHELMINA INTERNATIONAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nNote 1. Business Activity\nOverview\nThe primary business of Wilhelmina is fashion model management. These business operations are headquartered in\nNew York City. The Company’s predecessor was founded in 1967 by Wilhelmina Cooper, a renowned fashion model, and\nbecame one of the oldest, best known, and largest fashion model management companies in the world. Since its founding,\nWilhelmina has grown to include operations located in Los Angeles, Miami, and London, as well as a network of\nlicensees. Wilhelmina provides traditional, full-service fashion model and talent management services, specializing in the\nrepresentation and management of models, entertainers, athletes and other talent, to various clients, including retailers,\ndesigners, advertising agencies, print and electronic media, and catalog companies.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“GAAP”). The following is a summary of significant policies used in the preparation of the\naccompanying financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Wilhelmina and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All\nsignificant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”). ASC 606 establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the\ntransfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in\nexchange for those goods or services.\nUnder the revenue standard, the Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods\nor services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods\nor services. The Company recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify\ncontract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv)\nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) the\nCompany satisfies the performance obligation.\nService Revenues\nOur service revenues are derived primarily from fashion model bookings and representation of social media\ninfluencers and actors for commercials, film, and television. Revenues from services are recognized net of amounts owed to\nmodel talent, including taxes required to be withheld and remitted directly to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other\nagencies, and related costs such as those paid for photography, when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product,\nwhich occurs at a point in time, typically when the talent has completed the contractual requirement. The Company expenses\nincremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred because the expected amortization period of the asset that it\nwould have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. Our performance obligations are primarily satisfied\nat a point in time when the talent has completed the contractual requirements.\nA contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when,\nor as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The performance obligations for most of the Company’s core modeling bookings\nare satisfied on the day of the event, and the “day rate” total fee is agreed in advance, when the customer books the model for\na particular date. For contracts with multiple performance obligations (which are typically all satisfied within 1 to 3 days),\nwe allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling\nprice.\nF-10\nWilhelmina operates broadly as a modeling and talent agency. The models and talent represented by the Company\nhave discretion in agreeing to the price for a photoshoot or other service and may decline any job opportunity for any reason.\nAfter bookings are arranged by the Company, models and talent provide their personal services directly to the Company’s\nclients. The Company charges commissions to both models/talent and customers, which is a fixed percentage of the billing\nrate for the model or talent. Based on these and other factors, the Company acts as an agent in the service transaction and,\ntherefore, reports service revenues on a basis net of pass-through model or talent cost.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a net basis, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross\namounts billed to customers, inclusive of model costs. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models\nappear large relative to total revenue.\nService revenues from international sales accounted for 6.7% and 7.8% of the Company’s consolidated services\nrevenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLicense Fees\nLicense fees, in connection with the licensing of the “Wilhelmina” name, are collected on a quarterly basis under\nthe terms of Wilhelmina’s agreements with licensees. The Company recognizes revenue relating to license fees where\npayment is deemed to be probable, over the license period.\nContract Assets\nContract assets, which primarily relate to the Company’s right to consideration for work completed but not billed at\nthe reporting date are included within accounts receivable. The Company had no contract assets at December 31, 2023 and\napproximated $1.9 million at December 31, 2022.\nAdvances to Models\nAdvances to models for the cost of initial portfolios and other out-of-pocket costs, which are reimbursable only from\ncollections from the Company’s clients as a result of future work, are expensed to model costs as incurred net of such costs\nthat are expected to be recouped.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Accounting\nestimates and assumptions discussed herein are those that management considers to be the most critical to an understanding\nof the consolidated financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Estimates\nare used for, but not limited to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives for depreciation and\namortization, income taxes, the assumptions used for share-based compensation, and impairments of goodwill and intangible\nassets. All of these estimates reflect management’s judgment about current economic and market conditions and their effects\nbased on information available as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. If such conditions persist longer or\ndeteriorate further than expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change, which may result\nin future impairments of assets among other effects.\nCash, Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company held cash in banks of $6.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents include cash\non hand, cash in banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less.\nShort Term Investments\nShort-term investments with maturities over three and up to twelve months are recorded in short-term investments.\nThe Company’s short term investments at December 31, 2023 were held in United States Treasury securities and were\nclassified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Interest income on short-term investments is recognized on an accrual\nbasis.\nF-11\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are accounted for at net realizable value, do not bear interest and are short-term in nature. The\nCompany maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect on accounts\nreceivable. Based on management’s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge\nto earnings and a credit to the allowance. At December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance of $1.9 million, and recorded\na $0.1 million bad debt charge to earnings. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection\nefforts are written off through a charge to the allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company generally does\nnot require collateral.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a basis net of model costs, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount\nof gross amounts billed to customers inclusive of model costs. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to\nmodels appear large relative to total revenue.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe balance sheet items that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and\ncash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash balances in several different financial institutions\nin New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and London. Balances in accounts other than “noninterest-bearing transaction accounts”\nare insured up to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits of $250 thousand per institution. At December 31,\n2023, the Company had cash balances in excess of FDIC insurance coverage of approximately $3.7 million. Balances in\nLondon accounts are covered by Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) limits of £75 thousand or approximately\n$0.1 million per institution. At December 31, 2023, the Company had cash balances in excess of FSCS coverage of\napproximately $1.4 million. Concentrations of credit risk with accounts receivable are mitigated by the Company’s large\nnumber of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographical areas. The Company performs ongoing\ncredit evaluations of its clients and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of\nall accounts receivable.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization, based upon the shorter of the estimated\nuseful lives (ranging from two to seven years) of the assets or terms of the leases, are computed by use of the straight-line\nmethod. Leasehold improvements are amortized based upon the shorter of the terms of the leases or asset lives. When property\nand equipment are retired or sold, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the related\naccounts and gains or losses, if any, are reflected in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If it is determined that impairment has occurred, the amount of the\nimpairment is charged to operations. No such events or changes in circumstances were noted for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of the tangible\nand intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The Company’s intangible assets other than goodwill consist of\ntrademarks and trade name. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization, but rather to\nan annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair-value based test. A significant amount of judgment is required in\nestimating fair value and performing goodwill impairment tests.\nThere were no changes to the $7.5 million carrying amount of goodwill during 2022 or 2023. There were no changes\nto the carrying amount of $8.5 million trademarks and trade names intangible assets during 2022 or 2023.\nNo asset impairment charges were incurred relating to the Company’s goodwill or intangible assets during 2022 and\n2023.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires the Company to make estimates that\nmay significantly impact the outcome of the analysis. A qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as\nmacroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, and overall financial performance. If after\nperforming this assessment, the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less\nthan its carrying amount, then the Company performs the quantitative test. Under the quantitative test, a goodwill impairment\nF-12\nis identified by comparing the fair value to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair\nvalue, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, not to\nexceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nAt least annually, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets exceeds\ntheir fair value and, if necessary, records an impairment loss equal to any such excess. Declines in the Company’s stock price\ncould result in future goodwill impairment charges. The Company sometimes utilizes an independent valuation specialist to\nassist with the determination of fair value. Each interim reporting period, the Company assesses whether events or\ncircumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value. If the\ncarrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an asset impairment charge will be recognized in an amount\nequal to that excess. No such events or changes in circumstances were noted for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDue to Models\nDue to models represents the liability for amounts owed to talent for jobs that have taken place, but where the model\nor talent fee has not yet been paid, typically due to the Company awaiting receipt of payment from the customer. The due to\nmodel liabilities are accrued in the period in which the event takes place consistent with when the revenue is recognized. The\nCompany’s contractual agreements with models typically condition payment to talent after the collection of fees from the\ncustomer.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a basis net of model costs, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount\nof gross amounts billed to customers inclusive of model costs. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to\nmodels appear large relative to total revenue.\nContract Liabilities\nWe record deferred revenue, which is a contract liability, when we have entered into a contract with a customer and\ncash payments are received prior to satisfaction of the related performance obligation.\nAdvertising\nThe Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense, included in office and general expense\nin the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, was $21 thousand and $22 thousand in the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of\nexisting assets and liabilities and their respective tax base and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income\ntax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those\ntemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a\nchange in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company continually assesses\nthe need for a tax valuation allowance based on all available information.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements requires a recognition\nthreshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or\nexpected to be taken in a tax return. Also, consideration should be given to de-recognition, classification, interest and\npenalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Tax positions are subject to change in the future, as a\nnumber of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an established reserve is audited and finally resolved. Federal\ntax returns for tax years 2020 through 2022 remained open for examination as of December 31, 2023.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company utilizes share-based awards as a form of compensation for certain officers. The Company records\ncompensation expense for all awards granted. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model and straight-line\namortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the grants.\nF-13\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” (“ASC 820”), for financial assets\nand financial liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and\nexpands disclosure about fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies to all financial instruments that are being measured and\nreported on a fair value basis. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer\na liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair\nvalue hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in valuation methodologies into the following three levels:\n• Level 1 Inputs-Unadjusted: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 Inputs-Observable: inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted\nprices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data\nfor substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n• Level 3 Inputs-Unobservable: inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined\nusing pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or other valuation techniques, as well as instruments for\nwhich the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 “Financial Instruments -Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments”. ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment model with a methodology\nthat reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information\nto determine credit loss estimates. The primary impact of ASU 2016-13 relates to the Company’s assessment of its allowance\nof doubtful accounts on trade receivables. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,\nand interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2023, and the adoption\ndid not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures”. This ASU requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim\nbasis, primarily through enhanced disclosures of segment expenses. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted and the update should be applied retrospectively to each period presented in the financial statements. The Company\nis currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures”, which expands income tax disclosure requirements to include disaggregated information about a reporting\nentity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as a information on income taxes paid. The standard is effective for annual\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the updated should be applied on a prospective\nbasis, with a retrospective application permitted in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact\nof the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 3. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was comprised of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nFurniture and fixtures ...................................................................................................... $ 325 $ 422\nComputer and equipment ................................................................................................ 433 1,033\nLeasehold improvements ................................................................................................. 96 68\nTotal ................................................................................................................................ 854 1,523\nLess: Accumulated depreciation ......................................................................................

For the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, depreciation expense totaled $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nDepreciation expense increased primarily due to new assets in service in 2023.\nF-14\nNote 4. Leases\nThe Company is obligated under non-cancelable lease agreements for the rental of office space and various other\nlease agreements for the leasing of office equipment. These operating leases expire at various dates through 2030. In addition\nto the minimum base rent, the office space lease agreements provide that the Company shall pay its pro-rata share of real\nestate taxes and operating costs as defined in the lease agreements. The Company also leases certain corporate office facilities\nfrom an affiliate.\nDuring 2023, $0.1 million of lease payments were classified as amortization expense, and included within cash used\nin financing activities on the Company’s statement of cash flows. At December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining\nlease term was 5.1 years for operating leases and 4.4 years for finance type leases. At December 31, 2023, the weighted\naverage discount rate was 6.2% for operating leases and 7.8% for finance type leases.\nThe following table presents additional information regarding the Company’s financing and operating leases for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nYear ended Year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFinance lease expense\nAmortization of ROU assets ................................................................... $ 56 $ 64\nInterest on lease liabilities. ...................................................................... 7 8\nOperating lease expense ............................................................................. 916 608\nShort term lease expense ............................................................................ 221 353\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nfor finance leases\nFinancing cash flows .............................................................................. 63 68\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nfor operating leases\nOperating cash flows .............................................................................. 681 523\nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities\nFinance leases ......................................................................................... 123 -\nOperating leases ...................................................................................... 579 2,341\nAs of December 31, 2023, future maturities of lease liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\nOperating Finance\n2024 ................................................................................................................................. $ 926 $ 43\n2025 ................................................................................................................................. 959 43\n2026 ................................................................................................................................. 907 42\n2027 ................................................................................................................................. 574 30\n2028 ................................................................................................................................. 488 25\nThereafter ........................................................................................................................ 634 -\nTotal ................................................................................................................................ 4,488 183\nLess: Present value discount ............................................................................................

Commitments and Contingencies\nOn October 24, 2013, a putative class action lawsuit was brought against the Company by former Wilhelmina model\nAlex Shanklin and others, including Louisa Raske, Carina Vretman, Grecia Palomares and Michelle Griffin Trotter (the\n“Shanklin Litigation”), in New York State Supreme Court (New York County) by the same lead counsel who represented\nplaintiffs in a prior, now-dismissed action brought by Louisa Raske (the “Raske Litigation”). The claims in the Shanklin\nLitigation initially included breach of contract and unjust enrichment allegations arising out of matters similar to the Raske\nLitigation, such as the handling and reporting of funds on behalf of models and the use of model images. Other parties named\nas defendants in the Shanklin Litigation included other model management companies, advertising firms, and certain\nadvertisers. On January 6, 2014, the Company moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint in the Shanklin Litigation for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and other grounds, and other defendants also filed motions to\ndismiss. On August 11, 2014, the court denied the motion to dismiss as to Wilhelmina and other of the model management\ndefendants. Separately, on March 3, 2014, the judge assigned to the Shanklin Litigation wrote the Office of the New York\nAttorney General bringing the case to its attention, generally describing the claims asserted therein against the model\nmanagement defendants, and stating that the case “may involve matters in the public interest.” The judge’s letter also enclosed\na copy of his decision in the Raske Litigation, which dismissed that case.\nPlaintiffs retained substitute counsel, who filed a Second and then Third Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs’ Third\nAmended Complaint asserts causes of action for alleged breaches of the plaintiffs' management contracts with the defendants,\nconversion, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. The Third Amended Complaint also\nalleges that the plaintiff models were at all relevant times employees, and not independent contractors, of the model\nmanagement defendants, and that defendants violated the New York Labor Law in several respects, including, among other\nthings, by allegedly failing to pay the models the minimum wages and overtime pay required thereunder, not maintaining\naccurate payroll records, and not providing plaintiffs with full explanations of how their wages and deductions therefrom\nwere computed. The Third Amended Complaint seeks certification of the action as a class action, damages in an amount to\nbe determined at trial, plus interest, costs, attorneys’ fees, and such other relief as the court deems proper. On October 6,\n2015, Wilhelmina filed a motion to dismiss as to most of the plaintiffs’ claims. The Court entered a decision granting in part\nand denying in part Wilhelmina’s motion to dismiss on May 26, 2017. The Court (i) dismissed three of the five New York\nLabor Law causes of action, along with the conversion, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment\ncauses of action, in their entirety, and (ii) permitted only the breach of contract causes of action, and some plaintiffs’\nremaining two New York Labor Law causes of action to continue, within a limited time frame. The plaintiffs and\nWilhelmina each appealed, and the decision was affirmed on May 24, 2018. On August 16, 2017, Wilhelmina timely filed\nits Answer to the Third Amended Complaint.\nOn June 6, 2016, another putative class action lawsuit was brought against the Company by former Wilhelmina\nmodel Shawn Pressley and others, including Roberta Little (the “Pressley Litigation”), in New York State Supreme Court\n(New York County) by the same counsel representing the plaintiffs in the Shanklin Litigation, and asserting identical,\nalthough more recent, claims as those in the Shanklin Litigation. The Amended Complaint, asserting essentially the same\ntypes of claims as in the Shanklin action, was filed on August 16, 2017. Wilhelmina filed a motion to dismiss the Amended\nComplaint on September 29, 2017, which was granted in part and denied in part on May 10, 2018. Some New York Labor\nLaw and contract claims remain in the case. Pressley has withdrawn from the case, leaving Roberta Little as the sole\nremaining named plaintiff in the Pressley Litigation. On July 12, 2019, the Company filed its Answer and Counterclaim\nagainst Little.\nOn May 1, 2019, the Plaintiffs in the Shanklin Litigation (except Raske) and the Pressley Litigation filed motions\nfor class certification on their contract claims and the remaining New York Labor Law Claims. On July 12, 2019, Wilhelmina\nfiled its opposition to the motions for class certification and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment against Shanklin,\nVretman, Palomares, Trotter and Little, and a motion for summary judgment against Raske.\nBy Order dated May 8, 2020 (the “Class Certification Order”), the Court denied class certification in the Pressley\ncase, denied class certification with respect to the breach of contract and alleged unpaid usage claims, granted class\ncertification as to the New York Labor Law causes of action asserted by Vretman, Palomares, and Trotter, and declined to\nrule on Wilhelmina’s motions for summary judgment, denying them without prejudice to be re-filed at a later date. Currently\nthe parties are engaging in merits discovery.\nThe Company believes the claims asserted in the Shanklin Litigation and Pressley Litigation are without merit and\nintends to continue to vigorously defend the actions. Nonetheless, an adverse outcome in either case is at least reasonably\nF-16\npossible. However, the Company is presently unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible loss in either\ncase. Therefore, no amount has been accrued as of December 31, 2023 related to these matters.\nIn addition to the legal proceedings disclosed herein, the Company is also engaged in various legal proceedings that\nare routine in nature and incidental to its business. None of these routine proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate,\nare believed likely, in the Company's opinion, to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or its\nresults of operations.\nNote 6. Income Taxes\nThe following table summarizes the income tax (expense) benefit for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands):\n2023 2022\nCurrent:\nFederal .................................................................................................................. $ 40 $ (62 )\nState ......................................................................................................................

(230) 1,063\nTotal ...................................................................................................................... $ (258) $ 954\nThe income tax (expense) benefit differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal and state\nincome tax rates to the net income before income tax. The following table shows the reasons for these differences (in\nthousands):\n2023 2022\nComputed income tax expense at statutory rate .............................................................. $ (187) $ (540)\nDecrease (increase) in taxes resulting from:\nPermanent and other deductions, net ........................................................................... 55 (12)\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income ............................................................................ - (80)\nForeign income taxes ...................................................................................................

The\nincome tax benefit in 2022 and low effective tax rate was primarily the result of the full release of a previous $1.5 million\nvaluation allowance against deferred tax assets.\nGenerally, the Company’s combined effective tax rate is high relative to reported income before taxes as a result of\ncertain amortization expense and stock based compensation not being deductible and income being attributable to certain\nstates in which it operates. In recent years, the majority of taxes paid by the Company were state and foreign taxes, not U.S.\nfederal taxes. The Company operates in three states which have relatively high tax rates: California, New York, and Florida.\nRealization of net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, and other deferred tax temporary differences are\ncontingent upon future taxable earnings. The Company’s deferred tax assets are reviewed for expected utilization by assessing\nthe available positive and negative factors surrounding recoverability, including projected future taxable income, reversal of\nexisting taxable temporary differences, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. A valuation allowance is\nrecorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. There was no valuation allowance at\nDecember 31, 2023. The Company will continue to assess the evidence used to determine the need for a valuation allowance\nif warranted by changes in estimated future income and other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no federal income tax loss carryforwards.\nF-17\nThe following table shows the tax effect of significant temporary differences, which comprise the deferred tax asset\nand liability (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax asset:\nNet operating loss carryforward .................................................................................. $ 84 $ 63\nForeign tax credits ....................................................................................................... 184 474\nAccrued expenses ........................................................................................................ 660 573\nAllowance for doubtful accounts ................................................................................. 124 82\nLease liability .............................................................................................................. 1,026 1,008\nShare-based compensation ........................................................................................... 141 117\nOther intangible assets ................................................................................................. 1 11\nTotal deferred income tax asset ................................................................................... 2,220 2,328\nDeferred tax liability: ......................................................................................................\nProperty and equipment ...............................................................................................

(3,435) (3,313 )\nDeferred income tax, net .............................................................................................. $ (1,215) $ (985 )\nNet deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as noncurrent within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or\nrecovered. The Company recognizes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that these\nassets will not be realized. In making this determination, all positive and negative evidence is considered, including future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, future taxable income, and taxable income in\nprior carryback years.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had no U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and $0.5 million of\nforeign tax credit carryforwards which expire between 2023 and 2031. At December 31, 2023, the Company had no U.S.\nfederal net operating loss carryforwards and has $0.2 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards which expire between 2027\nand 2031.\nThe Company does not believe that it had any significant uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, nor is this expected to change within the next twelve months due to the settlement and expiration of\nstatutes of limitation.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduced significant\nchanges to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and\ncreated new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global\nintangible low-taxed income tax and base erosion tax, respectively. In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the\naccounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Act. The GILTI provisions\nimpose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The Company elected\nto treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.\nNote 7. Treasury Stock\nDuring 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby the Company could repurchase\nup to 500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. During 2013, the Board of Directors renewed and extended the\nCompany’s share repurchase authority to enable it to repurchase up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock. In\n2016, the Board of Directors increased by an additional 500,000 shares the number of shares of the Company’s common\nstock, which may be repurchased under its stock repurchase program to an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares. The shares may be\nrepurchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prices the Company deems\nappropriate. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be\nmodified or suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion.\nF-18\nFrom 2012 through December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 1,314,694 shares of common\nstock at an average price of approximately $4.85 per share, for a total of approximately $6.4 million in repurchases under the\nstock repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2023, no shares were repurchased. The repurchase of an\nadditional 185,306 shares is presently authorized under the stock repurchase program.\nNote 8. Related Parties\nThe Executive Chairman of the Company, Mark E. Schwarz, is also the chairman, chief executive officer and\nportfolio manager of Newcastle Capital Management, L.P. (“NCM”). NCM is the general partner of Newcastle Partners L.P.\n(“Newcastle”), which is the largest shareholder of the Company.\nThe Company’s corporate headquarters are located at the offices of NCM. The Company utilizes NCM facilities on\na month-to-month basis at $2.5 thousand per month, pursuant to a services agreement entered into between the parties. The\nCompany incurred expenses pursuant to the services agreement totaling $30 thousand for each of the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022. The Company did not owe NCM any amounts under the services agreement as of December 31, 2023.\nNote 9. Stock Options and Stock Purchase Warrants\nDuring 2015, shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Incentive Plan which authorized the issuance of up\nto 500,000 shares of the common stock pursuant to stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and other equity\nincentives awarded to directors, officers, consultants, advisors and employees of the Company. Stock option awards under\nthe 2015 Incentive Plan are granted at the market value of the common stock on the date of grant, vest over service periods\nof one to five years and terminate not more than ten years from the date of grant.\nUnder the 2015 Incentive Plan, no stock option awards were granted during 2023 or 2022. No stock options were\nexercised during either 2023 or 2022.\nThe following table shows a summary of stock option transactions under the 2015 Incentive Plan during 2023 and\n2022:\nWeighted\nAverage\nNumber Exercise\nof Shares Price\nOutstanding, January 1, 2022 .......................................................................................... 180,000 $ 5.93\nGranted ................................................................................................................. - -\nExercised .............................................................................................................. - -\nForfeited or expired .............................................................................................. - -\nOutstanding, December 31, 2022 .................................................................................... 180,000 $ 5.93\nGranted ................................................................................................................. - -\nExercised .............................................................................................................. - -\nForfeited or expired .............................................................................................. - -\nOutstanding, December 31, 2023 .................................................................................... 180,000 $ 5.93\nWeighted average remaining contractual life was 4.85 years at December 31, 2023 and 5.85 years at December 31,\n2022. The exercise price of all stock options was above the market value at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Therefore,\nthere is no intrinsic value at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Total unrecognized compensation expense on options outstanding\nas of December 31, 2023 was $50 thousand. Options to purchase 137,000 shares of common stock were exercisable as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each stock option granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes\noption pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of Wilhelmina’s and similar companies’\ncommon stock for a period equal to the expected term. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the contractual term of\nthe options are based on rates for U.S. Treasury Notes with maturity dates corresponding to the options’ expected lives on\nthe dates of grant. Expected term is determined based on the option term.\nF-19\nNo stock options were granted during 2023 and 2022.\nNote 10. Benefit Plans\nThe Company has established a 401(k) Plan for eligible employees of the Company. Generally, all employees of the\nCompany who are at least twenty-one years of age are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan is a defined\ncontribution plan, which provides that participants may make voluntary salary deferral contributions, on a pretax basis,\nbetween 1% and 100% of their compensation in the form of voluntary payroll deductions, up to a maximum amount as\nindexed for cost-of-living adjustments. The Company may make discretionary contributions. No discretionary contributions\nwere made during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nF-20\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nMark E.

BUSINESS\nDESCRIPTION OF THE WILHELMINA BUSINESS\nOverview\nThe primary business of Wilhelmina is fashion model management. The Company’s predecessor was founded in 1967 by Wilhelmina Cooper, a renowned fashion model, and\nbecame one of the oldest, best known, and largest fashion model management companies in the world. Headquartered in New York City, Wilhelmina has grown to include operations\nlocated in Los Angeles, Miami, and London, as well as a network of licensees. Wilhelmina provides traditional, full-service fashion model and talent management services, specializing in\nthe representation and management of models, entertainers, athletes and other talent, to various clients, including retailers, designers, advertising agencies, print and electronic media,\nand catalog companies. The Company maintains a website at https://www.wilhelmina.com.\nThe Aperture division operates in New York, Los Angeles and Miami, representing actors and models, for film, television, and commercials. Aperture also represents influencers\nfor brand campaigns and endorsements.\nWilhelmina London Limited (“London”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilhelmina International, Inc., was acquired in January 2015. The London subsidiary establishes a\nfootprint for the Company in Western Europe, provides a base of operations to service the Company’s European clients, and serves as a new talent development office for European\nmodels and artists.\nOrganization and Operating Divisions\nThe Company acquired the predecessor companies constituting its current primary business in 2008. The Company conducts its business through operating divisions and\nsubsidiaries engaged in fashion model management and other complementary businesses. These business activities are focused on the following key areas:\n● Fashion model and social media influencer management\n● Celebrity management\n● Licensing and branding associations\nFashion Model and Social Media Influencer Management\nWilhelmina is focused on providing fashion modeling talent and social media influencer services to clients such as advertising agencies, branded consumer goods companies,\nfashion designers, Internet sites, retailers, department stores, product catalogs and magazine publications.\nThe fashion model/talent/influencer management industry can be divided into many subcategories, including advertising campaigns, catalog/e-commerce, runway, showroom\nand editorial work. Advertising work involves modeling for advertisements featuring consumer products such as cosmetics, clothing and other items to be placed in magazines and\nnewspapers, on billboards and with other types of media. Catalog and e-commerce work involves modeling of products to be sold through promotional catalogs and Internet commerce\nsites. Runway work involves modeling at fashion shows, which primarily take place in Paris, Milan, London and New York City. Showroom work involves on-site modeling of products at\nclient showrooms and other events and production “fit” work whereby a model serves as the sizing model for apparel items. Editorial work involves modeling for the cover and editorial\nsections of magazines and websites.\n4\nClients pay for talent to appear in photo shoots for Internet sites, magazine features, print advertising, direct mail marketing, and product catalogs, as well as to appear in runway\nshows to present new designer collections, fit modeling, and on-location presentations and events. In addition, talent may also appear in film and television commercials. Wilhelmina\ndevelops and diversifies its talent portfolio through a combination of ongoing local, regional and international scouting and talent-search efforts to source new talent, as well as\ncooperating with other agencies that represent talent.\nWithin its fashion model management business, Wilhelmina’s primary source of service revenue is from model fees and services charges paid by the client for bookings directly\nnegotiated by the Company. The Company also receives commissions paid on bookings by third-party agencies. Wilhelmina believes that its model fees, service charges and commission\nrates are competitive with those of its principal competitors.\nWilhelmina’s fashion model management operations are organized into divisions called “boards,” each of which specializes by the type of models it represents. Wilhelmina’s\nboards are generally described in the table below.\nBoard Name Location Target Market\nWomen NYC, LA, Miami, London High-end female fashion models\nMen NYC, LA, Miami, London High-end male fashion models\nDirect NYC, LA, Miami, London Established/commercial male/female fashion models\nCurve NYC, LA, Miami, London Full-figured female fashion models\nShowroom NYC, LA, Miami Live modeling and designer fit clothing modeling\nFitness NYC, LA, Miami Athletic models\nEach major board is headed by a director who manages the agents assigned to the board. The agents of each board act both as bookers (including promoting models,\nnegotiating fees and contracting work) and as talent scouts/managers (including providing models with career and development guidance and helping them better market\nthemselves). Although agents individually develop professional relationships with models, models are represented by a board collectively and not by a specific agent. Wilhelmina’s\norganization into boards enables Wilhelmina to provide clients with services tailored to their particular needs, to allow models to benefit from agents’ specialized experience in their\nparticular markets, and to limit Wilhelmina’s dependency on any specialty market or agent.\nMost senior agents are employed pursuant to employment agreements that include noncompetition provisions such as a prohibition from working with Wilhelmina’s models and\nclients for a certain period of time after the end of the agent’s employment with Wilhelmina. Wilhelmina typically signs its models to three-year exclusive contracts, which it actively\nenforces.\nCelebrity Management\nWilhelmina’s Celebrity division seeks to secure endorsement and spokesperson work for celebrities from the worlds of sports, music and entertainment. The Celebrity division\nhas two primary sources of revenue: (i) commissions paid by talent as a percentage of their gross earnings; and (ii) royalties or a service charge paid by clients. Wilhelmina’s Celebrity\ndivision management works with emerging artists and established celebrity names to match them with leading fashion brands and companies.\nLicensing & Branding Associations\nWilhelmina Licensing, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary that collects third-party licensing fees in connection with the licensing of the “Wilhelmina” name. Third-party licensees\ninclude leading fashion model agencies in local markets in the U.S. and internationally. The film and television business consists of occasional television syndication royalties and\nproduction series contracts. Also, from time to time, the Company conducts other events, such as model search contests, in an effort to expand the Wilhelmina brand and recruit talent.\n5\nCompetition\nThe fashion model/talent management business is highly competitive. New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami, as well as London, Paris, and Milan, are considered the most\nimportant markets for the fashion talent management industry. Most of the leading international firms are headquartered in New York City. Wilhelmina’s principal competitors include\nother large fashion model management businesses in the U.S., including IMG Models, Elite Model Management, Ford Models, Inc., DNA Model Management, NEXT Model\nManagement, The Lions Model Management, The Society Management, Women 360 Management, and New York Model Management. However, Wilhelmina is the only publicly-owned\nfashion talent management company in the world.\nCompetition also includes foreign agencies and smaller U.S. agencies in local markets that recruit local talent and cater to local market needs. Several of the larger fashion talent\nfirms operate offices in multiple cities and countries or have chosen to partner with local or foreign agencies.\nThe Company believes that its sources of revenue, mainly generated from commissions and service charges, are comparable to those of its principal competitors. Therefore, for\nthe Company to obtain a competitive advantage, it must develop and maintain a deep pool of talent and deliver high quality service to its clients. The Company believes that through its\nscouting efforts, name recognition, and licensing network, it is able to recruit a deeper pool of talent relative to its competitors. These recruitment tools, coupled with the broad range of\nfashion boards available to the Company’s talent, enable the Company to develop talent and generate a broader range of revenues relative to its principal competitors. While a broad\nrange of talent and boards provides a level of stability to the business, certain talent may be more inclined to work with a boutique agency that may appear to tailor more specifically to\ntheir needs.\nFor more than 55 years, Wilhelmina and its predecessors have created long-standing client relationships and business activities related to the fashion model management\nbusiness that provide exposure to diverse markets and demographics. The Company has also developed a professional workforce with years of talent management experience.\nClients and Customers\nAs of December 31, 2023, Wilhelmina represented a roster of approximately 1,600 active models and talent. Wilhelmina’s active models include Ana Maria Figueroa, Yumi Nu, Francisco\nLachowski, Daniel Shin, Ana Cristina, Olga Sherer, Serena Marques, Valentine Charrasse, Douglas Dillon, Fernando Cabral, Hella Tall, Asya Rosh, Francisco Henriques, Aubrey Hill,\nDaniel Puig, Joshuah Melnick, Noah Brown, Sofia Resing, Lamich Kirabo, Penny Lane, Africa Perez, Carmen Fozzard, Bojana Krsmanović, Mitchell Slaggert, Anne de Paula, Jan Baiboon,\nOttawa Efoe, Rainer Andreesen, Erik Van Gils, Kate King, Malik Lindo, Malcolm Jackson, Haejin Lee, Moon Young, Isabela Grutman, Sabey Dantsira, Lauren Auerbach, Davidson\nObennebo, Sasha Melnychuk, Armando Cabral, Jennae Quisenberry, Vanessa Cruz, Pure, Akito Mizutani, Nayara Oliveira, Fernando Lindez, Dachuan Jin, Claudio Monteiro, and Nathan\nOwens.\nWilhelmina serves approximately 2,800 external clients. Wilhelmina’s customer base is highly diversified, with no one customer accounting for more than 3% of overall gross\nrevenues. The top 100 clients of Wilhelmina together accounted for approximately 43.1% of overall revenues during 2023.\nGovernmental Regulations\nCertain jurisdictions in which Wilhelmina operates, such as California and Florida, require that companies maintain a Talent Agency License in order to engage in the “talent\nagency” business. The talent agency business is generally considered the business of procuring engagements or any employment or placement of a talent, where the talent performs in\nhis or her artistic capacity. Where required, the Wilhelmina subsidiaries operating in these jurisdictions maintain Talent Agency Licenses issued by those jurisdictions.\nTrends and Opportunities\nThe Company expects that the combination of Wilhelmina’s main operating base in New York City, the industry’s capital, with the depth and breadth of its talent pool and client\nroster and its diversification across various talent management segments, together with its geographical reach, should make Wilhelmina’s operations more resilient to industry changes\nand economic swings than those of many of the smaller firms operating in the industry.\n6\nWith total annual advertising expenditures on major media (newspapers, magazines, television, cinema, outdoor and Internet) estimated to have exceeded $260 billion in recent\nyears, North America is the world’s largest advertising market. For the fashion talent management industry, including Wilhelmina, advertising expenditures on television, Internet,\nmagazines, and outdoor are of particular relevance.\nIn recent periods, traditional retail clients in the fashion and beauty industry have had increased competition from digital, social, and new media, reducing their budgets for\nadvertising and model talent. Wilhelmina reviews the mix of talent and resources available to best operate in this changing environment.\nAlthough Wilhelmina has a large and diverse client base, it is not immune to global economic conditions. The Company closely monitors economic conditions, client spending,\nand other industry factors and continually evaluates opportunities to increase its market share and further expand its geographic reach. There can be no assurance as to the effects on\nWilhelmina of current or future economic circumstances, client spending patterns, client creditworthiness, and other developments and whether, or to what extent, Wilhelmina’s efforts to\nrespond to them will be effective.\nStrategy\nManagement’s strategy is to increase value to shareholders through the following initiatives:\n• increase Wilhelmina’s brand awareness among advertisers and potential talent;\n• expand the women’s high end fashion board;\n• expand the Aperture division’s representation in commercials, film, and television;\n• expand social media influencer and celebrity representation;\n• expand the Wilhelmina network through strategic geographic market development; and\n• promote model search contests and events and partner on media projects (television, film, books, etc.).\nThe Company makes use of digital technology to effectively connect with clients and talent, utilizing video conferencing and other digital tools to best position our team to\nidentify opportunities to grow the careers of the talent we represent and expand our business. The Company has made significant investments in technology, infrastructure, and\npersonnel, to support our clients and talent.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 87 full time employees, 47 of whom were located in New York City, 11 of whom were located at Wilhelmina’s Miami office, 17 of whom\nwere located at Wilhelmina’s Los Angeles office, 10 of whom were located at Wilhelmina’s London office and two of whom were located at the corporate headquarters in Dallas.\nTRADEMARKS AND LICENSING\nThe “Wilhelmina” brand is essential to the success and competitive position of the Company. The “Wilhelmina” trademark is vital to the licensing business because licensees\npay for the right to use the trademark. The Company has invested significant resources in the “Wilhelmina” brands in order to obtain the public recognition that these brands currently\nenjoy. Wilhelmina relies upon domestic and international trademark laws, license agreements and nondisclosure agreements to protect the “Wilhelmina” brand name used in its\nbusiness. Trademarks registered in the U.S. have a duration of ten years and are generally subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period on continued use and appropriate\napplication.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNot applicable to smaller reporting company.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n7\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and\ninformation. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is designed to identify, assess, and manage the cybersecurity risks that are relevant to our business and is integrated into our\noverall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program\nto other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n• risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise information\ntechnology environment;\n• managing (i) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (ii) our security controls, and (iii) our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n• the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\n• carrying cyber risk insurance that provides protection (as specified in the applicable policies) against certain potential costs and losses arising from a cybersecurity\nincident;\n• regular communications to all employees from management informing of the types of threats to be aware of and procedure to follow when a risk has been identified;\n• requiring employees, as well as contractors who have access to our systems or the data of our employees or customers, to treat information as confidential.\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We have not currently engaged any third party service providers to support,\nmanage, or supplement our cybersecurity processes.\nGOVERNANCE\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of increasing focus for the Company’s Board of Directors and management.\nThe Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee periodically receives\nupdates from management and our third party IT support specialists of our cybersecurity threat risk management and mitigation strategies covering topics such as data security posture\nand potentially material cybersecurity threat risks or incidents, as well as the steps management has taken to respond to such risks. In such sessions, the Audit Committee generally\nreceives information describing current and emerging material cybersecurity threat risks, and describing the company’s plans to mitigate those risks, and discusses such matters with our\nthird party IT support specialists and other members of senior management. Potentially material cybersecurity threat risks are also considered during separate Board discussions of\nimportant matters like enterprise risk management.\nWhile the Audit Committee reviews and oversees the Company’s information security efforts, senior leadership is responsible for the day-to-day management of cybersecurity\nrisk and the design and implementation of policies, processes and procedures to identify and mitigate this risk. These members of management are informed about and monitor the\nprevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy\nprocesses described above, including the operation of our incident response plan.\n8\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations comparing the calendar years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. This section\nshould be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that are incorporated herein by reference and the other financial information\nincluded herein and the notes thereto.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022\nIn addition to net income, the key financial indicators that the Company reviews to monitor its business are revenues, operating expenses, and cash flows.\nThe Company analyzes revenue by reviewing the mix of revenues generated by the different “boards,” each a specific division of the fashion model management operations\nwhich specializes by the type of model it represents, by geographic locations and from significant clients. Within its fashion model management business, Wilhelmina’s primary source of\nservice revenue is from model fees and service charges paid by the client for bookings directly negotiated by the Company. The Company also receives commissions paid on bookings\nby third-party agencies. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Revenue Recognition.”\nWilhelmina provides professional services. Therefore, salary and service costs represent the largest part of the Company’s operating expenses. Salary and service costs are\ncomprised of payroll and related costs and travel, meals, and entertainment (“T&E”) to deliver the Company’s services and to enable new business development activities.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Statements of Income\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nService revenues 17,182 17,750\nLicense fees and other income 30 30\nTOTAL REVENUES 17,212 17,780\nSalaries and service costs 11,481 10,907\nOffice and general expenses 3,830 3,168\nAmortization and depreciation 208 193\nCorporate overhead 965 1,093\nOPERATING INCOME 728 2,419\nOPERATING MARGIN 4.2% 13.6%\nForeign exchange (gain) loss 106 (164)\nInterest income (76) -\nInterest expense 7 8\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 691 2,575\nCurrent income tax expense (28) (109)\nDeferred tax benefit (expense) (230) 1,063\nEffective tax rate 37.3% (37.0%)\nNET INCOME 433 3,529\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Information\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nGross billings 65,936 66,686\nEBITDA 830 2,776\nAdjusted EBITDA 1,020 2,802\nPre-Corporate EBITDA 1,985 3,895\nSee page 14 for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures and for other important information. Certain prior period\nGross billings amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n11\nService Revenues\nThe Company’s service revenues fluctuate in response to its clients’ willingness to spend on advertising and the Company’s ability to have the desired talent available.\nThe revenue decrease of 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to decreased commissions from model\nbookings.\nLicense Fees and Other Income\nLicense fees and other income include franchise revenues from independently owned model agencies that use the Wilhelmina trademark and various services provided by the\nCompany. License fees were unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSalaries and Service Costs\nSalaries and service costs consist of payroll related costs and travel and entertainment expenses required to deliver the Company’s services to its clients and talents. The 5.3%\nincrease in salaries and service costs for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to personnel hires and payroll\nchanges to better align Wilhelmina staffing with the needs of each office and geographical region.\nOffice and General Expenses\nOffice and general expenses consist of office and equipment rents, advertising and promotion, insurance expenses, administration and technology cost. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, office and general expenses increased 20.9% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased legal expense, rent expense, utilities,\ncomputer expenses, and other office related expenses.\nAmortization and Depreciation\nAmortization and depreciation expense is incurred with respect to certain assets, including computer hardware, software, office equipment, furniture and finance\nleases. Amortization and depreciation expense increased by 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased\ndepreciation of capitalized furniture and leasehold assets at the Company’s New York City office. Fixed asset purchases (mostly related to furniture, leasehold improvements, and\ncomputer equipment) totaled approximately $165 thousand in 2023 and $268 thousand in 2022.\nCorporate Overhead\nCorporate overhead expenses include director and executive officer compensation, legal, audit and professional fees, corporate office rent and travel. Corporate overhead\ndecreased by 11.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to costs related to the filing of two SEC restatement filings\nin 2022 that did not recur in 2023.\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\nOperating income was $0.7 million and operating margin was 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to operating income of $2.4 million and operating margin of\n13.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022. These declines were primarily the result of the increase in operating expenses and reduction in revenues.\nForeign Currency Exchange\nThe Company realized a loss of $106 thousand from foreign currency exchange during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $164 thousand from foreign\ncurrency exchange during the year ended December 31, 2022. Foreign currency gain and loss is due to fluctuations in currencies from Great Britain, Europe, and Latin America.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable interest earned on United States treasury securities. Interest income is recognized on an accrual\nbasis.\n12\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to accrued interest on finance leases. See, “Liquidity and Capital\nResources.”\nIncome before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes decreased to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The lower pre-tax\nincome in 2023 was primarily due to lower operating income.\nIncome Taxes\nGenerally, the Company’s combined effective tax rate is high relative to reported net income as a result of foreign taxes and income being attributable to certain states in which it\noperates. The Company operates in three states which have relatively high tax rates: California, New York, and Florida. In addition, foreign taxes in the United Kingdom related to our\nLondon office are not deductible for U.S. federal tax purposes. The Company had income tax expense of $0.3 million in 2023 compared to $1.0 million of income tax benefit in 2022.\nThe income tax benefit in 2022 was primarily the result of the full release of a previous $1.5 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. As of each reporting date,\nmanagement considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. In connection with its assessment for 2022,\nmanagement determined that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that it was more likely than not that all deferred tax assets were realizable. This evidence included three years of\ncumulative pretax income, excluding nonrecurring items. The Company will continue to assess the evidence used to determine the need for a valuation allowance and may reinstate the\nvaluation allowance in future periods if warranted by changes in estimated future income and other factors.\nNet Income\nThe Company had net income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in\nnet income was primarily due to the decrease in operating income and the release of the previous valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in 2022.\nGross Billings\nGross billings is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the gross amount billed to customers on behalf of its clients (models and talent) for services performed. Gross\nbillings decreased 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to decreased Aperture division bookings. See page 14\nfor more information regarding non-GAAP financial measures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s cash balance decreased to $6.1 million at December 31, 2023 from $12.0 million at December 31, 2022. The cash balance decreased primarily as a result of $0.7\nmillion net cash provided by operating activities, $6.7 million cash used in investing activities, $0.1 million cash used in financing activities, and the $0.2 million effect of exchange rate on\ncash flow.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $0.7 million was primarily the result of decreases in accounts receivable and right of use assets and an increase in deferred income\ntaxes, partially offset by decreases in amounts due to models, lease liabilities and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The $6.7 million cash used in investing activities was\nattributable to purchases of short term investments and property and equipment, including furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, software and computer equipment, partially\noffset by maturities of short term investments. The $63 thousand cash used in financing activities was attributable to payments on finance leases.\nThe Company’s primary liquidity needs are for working capital associated with performing services under its client contracts. Generally, the Company incurs significant operating\nexpenses with payment terms shorter than its average collections on billings. Based on budgeted and year-to-date cash flow information, management believes that the Company has\nsufficient liquidity to meet its projected operational expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months and beyond.\n13\nImportant Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the Company's\nfinancial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. The Company considers Gross Billings, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Corporate\nEBITDA to be important measures of performance because they are key operating metrics of the Company's business. These metrics are used by management in its planning and\nbudgeting processes, to monitor and evaluate its financial and operating results, and to provide stockholders and potential investors with a means to evaluate the Company's financial\nand operating results against other companies within the Company's industry.\nGross Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers on behalf of its models and talent for services performed. The Company calculates Gross Billings as total revenue\nplus model costs, which includes amounts owed to talent, including taxes required to be withheld and remitted directly to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and\nrelated costs such as those paid for photography. The Company calculates EBITDA as net income plus interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and\namortization expense. The Company calculates “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA plus foreign exchange gain/loss, share-based payment expense and certain significant non-recurring\nitems that the Company may include from time to time. The Company calculates “Pre-Corporate EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA plus corporate overhead expense, which includes director\ncompensation, securities laws compliance costs, audit and professional fees, and other public company costs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with\nGAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company's financial position, results of\noperations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual and future financial condition and performance. The methods used by the Company to\ncalculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures\npresented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.\nGross Billings\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure Gross Billings to GAAP total revenues, which the Company believes to be the most comparable\nGAAP measure\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nTotal revenues $ 17,212 $ 17,780\nModel costs 48,724 48,906\nGross Billings $ 65,936 $ 66,686\nModel costs include amounts owed to talent, including taxes required to be withheld and remitted directly to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and related\ncosts such as those paid for photography.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pre-Corporate EBITDA\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pre-Corporate EBITDA to GAAP net income, which the Company\nbelieves to be the most comparable GAAP measure\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nNet income $ 433 $ 3,529\nInterest income (76) -\nInterest expense 7 8\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 258 (954)\nAmortization and depreciation 208 193\nEBITDA $ 830 $ 2,776\nForeign exchange loss (gain) 106 (164)\nShare based payment expense 84 190\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 1,020 $ 2,802\nCorporate overhead 965 1,093\nPre-Corporate EBITDA $ 1,985 $ 3,895\n14\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, and\nexpenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many\ninstances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to\nperiod. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and\nactual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\nThe following items require significant estimation or judgement. For additional information about our accounting policies, refer to “Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies” in the audited consolidated financial statements included herewith.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wilhelmina and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”). ASC 606\nestablishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange\nfor those goods or services.\nOur revenues are derived primarily from fashion model bookings, and representation of social media influencers and actors for commercials, film, and television. Our performance\nobligations are primarily satisfied at a point in time when the talent has completed the contractual requirements.\nA contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The\nperformance obligations for most of the Company’s core modeling bookings are satisfied on the day of the event, and the “day rate” total fee is agreed in advance when the customer\nbooks the model for a particular date. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the\nestimated relative standalone selling price.\nWe report service revenues on a net basis, which represents gross amounts billed net of amounts owed to talent, including taxes required to be withheld and remitted directly to\ntaxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and related costs such as those paid for photography. The Company typically enters into contractual agreements with models\nunder which the Company is obligated to pay talent upon collection of fees from the customer.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a net basis, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross amounts billed to customers, inclusive of model costs. As a\nresult, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models appear large relative to total revenue.\nAmounts billed that have not yet met the applicable revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue within accrued expenses and the related talent costs are\nrecorded as contract liability.\nShare Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a\nstraight line basis as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The determination of the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant\nusing an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include the estimated\nvolatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, estimated forfeitures, and expected dividends.\n15\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, the United Kingdom, and numerous local jurisdictions.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will\nbe available against which they can be used. Unused tax loss carry-forwards are reviewed at each reporting date and a valuation allowance is established if it is doubtful we will generate\nsufficient future taxable income to utilize the loss carry-forwards.\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, we take into account whether additional taxes, interest, or penalties may be due. Although we believe that we have\nadequately reserved for our income taxes, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome is different than\nthe amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nCash, Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less.\nShort Term Investments\nShort-term investments with maturities over three and up to twelve months are recorded in Short-term investments.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are accounted for at net realizable value, do not bear interest, and are short-term in nature. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for\nestimated losses resulting from the inability to collect on accounts receivable. Based on management’s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a\ncharge to earnings and a credit to the allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the\nallowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company generally does not require collateral.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a basis net of model costs, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross amounts billed to customers inclusive of model\ncosts. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models appear large relative to total revenue.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Testing\nThe Company performs impairment testing at least annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is\nrecognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company sometimes utilizes an independent valuation specialist to assist with the\ndetermination of fair value. In accordance with ASU 2017-03, only a one-step quantitative impairment test is performed, whereby a goodwill impairment loss will be measured as the excess\nof a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the\ncarrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill.\nWhenever events or circumstances change, entities have the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment. If impairment is deemed\nmore likely than not, management would perform the goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the goodwill impairment test is not required. In assessing the qualitative factors, the Company\nassesses relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how\nthese may impact a reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions. The judgment and assumptions include the identification of\nmacroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, Company specific events and share price trends, an assessment of whether each relevant\nfactor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact.\nThe Company evaluates indefinite lived trademark and trade name intangible assets for impairment using the relief from royalty method. This valuation approach requires that\nthe Company make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value, including projections of future revenues, royalty rates, tax rates, discount rates, and other relevant variables. The\nprojections in this model are updated annually and will change over time based on historical performance and changing business conditions. If the carrying value exceeded the estimated\nfair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess amount.\n16\nITEM 7A.

Based on their evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, with the participation of the Company’s management, have concluded that the Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the\nExchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to management,\nincluding the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules\n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework in Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management\nconcluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nDuring the most recent fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n17\nITEM 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of\ntheir operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

The Company elected not to perform the\nqualitative assessment (Step 0) in connection with testing its trademarks and trade name for impairment. Instead, a quantitative assessment (Step 1) was performed using the royalty-\nrelief method, which is based upon projected revenues and estimated royalty and discount rates. The determination of the fair value of the trademarks and trade name requires\nmanagement to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues and royalty and discount rates. As disclosed by management, changes in these\nassumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the trademarks and trade name and the amount of any impairment expense recognized.\nWe identified the Step 1 trademarks and trade name impairment assessment as a critical audit matter, as auditing management’s judgments regarding forecasts for future revenue and\nroyalty and discount rates involve a high degree of subjectivity and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve our external fair value specialists.\nF-2\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the critical audit matter included the following:\n● We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls over the estimates and assumptions used by management in the determination\nof the fair value of the trademarks and trade name including controls addressing:\no Review and approval of key assumptions and inputs, including financial projections, projected growth rates of revenues, capitalization, royalty and discount rates and peer\ninformation used in the model.\no The completeness and accuracy of the model.\n● We performed, with the assistance of an auditor employed valuation specialist, substantive procedures on management’s estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair\nvalue of the trademarks and trade names including:\no We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of future revenues by comparing these forecasts to historical operating results and industry data, and\nconsidered whether such assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\no We tested the mathematical accuracy of the model, as well as the completeness and accuracy of the information used in it.\no We evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology used, as well as the capitalization, royalty and discount rate assumptions.\no We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s royalty rate, net of support costs rate, by developing an independent range using guideline royalty rate data.\no We performed a retrospective review of the Company’s prior year forecasted revenue using the current year’s actual operating results and considered management’s ability\nto reasonably forecast and project revenue without bias.\no We performed a sensitivity analysis of the royalty and discount rates to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the trademarks and trade name that would result from such\nchanges in the assumptions.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2023.\n/s/ Bodwell Vasek Wells DeSimone LLP\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 26, 2024\nF-3\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and board of directors\nof Wilhelmina International, Inc. and Subsidiaries:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Wilhelmina International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n\"consolidated financial statements\").

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nNote 1. Business Activity\nOverview\nThe primary business of Wilhelmina is fashion model management. These business operations are headquartered in New York City. The Company’s predecessor was founded in\n1967 by Wilhelmina Cooper, a renowned fashion model, and became one of the oldest, best known, and largest fashion model management companies in the world. Since its founding,\nWilhelmina has grown to include operations located in Los Angeles, Miami, and London, as well as a network of licensees. Wilhelmina provides traditional, full-service fashion model and\ntalent management services, specializing in the representation and management of models, entertainers, athletes and other talent, to various clients, including retailers, designers,\nadvertising agencies, print and electronic media, and catalog companies.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The following is a\nsummary of significant policies used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Wilhelmina and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company has adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”). ASC 606\nestablishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange\nfor those goods or services.\nUnder the revenue standard, the Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration\nwhich the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i)\nidentify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance\nobligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.\nService Revenues\nOur service revenues are derived primarily from fashion model bookings and representation of social media influencers and actors for commercials, film, and television. Revenues\nfrom services are recognized net of amounts owed to model talent, including taxes required to be withheld and remitted directly to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies,\nand related costs such as those paid for photography, when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product, which occurs at a point in time, typically when the talent has\ncompleted the contractual requirement. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred because the expected amortization period of the asset that\nit would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. Our performance obligations are primarily satisfied at a point in time when the talent has completed the\ncontractual requirements.\nA contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The\nperformance obligations for most of the Company’s core modeling bookings are satisfied on the day of the event, and the “day rate” total fee is agreed in advance, when the customer\nbooks the model for a particular date. For contracts with multiple performance obligations (which are typically all satisfied within 1 to 3 days), we allocate the contract’s transaction price\nto each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price.\nWilhelmina operates broadly as a modeling and talent agency. The models and talent represented by the Company have discretion in agreeing to the price for a photoshoot or\nother service and may decline any job opportunity for any reason. After bookings are arranged by the Company, models and talent provide their personal services directly to the\nCompany’s clients. The Company charges commissions to both models/talent and customers, which is a fixed percentage of the billing rate for the model or talent. Based on these and\nother factors, the Company acts as an agent in the service transaction and, therefore, reports service revenues on a basis net of pass-through model or talent cost.\nF-10\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a net basis, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross amounts billed to customers, inclusive of model costs. As a\nresult, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models appear large relative to total revenue.\nService revenues from international sales accounted for 6.7% and 7.8% of the Company’s consolidated services revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nLicense Fees\nLicense fees, in connection with the licensing of the “Wilhelmina” name, are collected on a quarterly basis under the terms of Wilhelmina’s agreements with licensees. The\nCompany recognizes revenue relating to license fees where payment is deemed to be probable, over the license period.\nContract Assets\nContract assets, which primarily relate to the Company’s right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date are included within accounts receivable.\nThe Company had no contract assets at December 31, 2023 and approximated $1.9 million at December 31, 2022.\nAdvances to Models\nAdvances to models for the cost of initial portfolios and other out-of-pocket costs, which are reimbursable only from collections from the Company’s clients as a result of future\nwork, are expensed to model costs as incurred net of such costs that are expected to be recouped.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the accompanying notes. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed herein are those that management considers to be the most critical to an\nunderstanding of the consolidated financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Estimates are used for, but not limited to revenue\nrecognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, income taxes, the assumptions used for share-based compensation, and impairments of\ngoodwill and intangible assets. All of these estimates reflect management’s judgment about current economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of\nthe date of these consolidated financial statements. If such conditions persist longer or deteriorate further than expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could\nchange, which may result in future impairments of assets among other effects.\nCash, Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company held cash in banks of $6.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, and short-term, highly liquid\ninvestments with maturities of three months or less.\nShort Term Investments\nShort-term investments with maturities over three and up to twelve months are recorded in short-term investments. The Company’s short term investments at December 31, 2023\nwere held in United States Treasury securities and were classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Interest income on short-term investments is recognized on an accrual basis.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are accounted for at net realizable value, do not bear interest and are short-term in nature. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for\nestimated losses resulting from the inability to collect on accounts receivable. Based on management’s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a\ncharge to earnings and a credit to the allowance. At December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance of $1.9 million, and recorded a $0.1 million bad debt charge to earnings. Balances\nthat remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company\ngenerally does not require collateral.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a basis net of model costs, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross amounts billed to customers inclusive of model\ncosts. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models appear large relative to total revenue.\nF-11\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe balance sheet items that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company\nmaintains its cash balances in several different financial institutions in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and London. Balances in accounts other than “noninterest-bearing transaction\naccounts” are insured up to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits of $250 thousand per institution. At December 31, 2023, the Company had cash balances in excess of\nFDIC insurance coverage of approximately $3.7 million. Balances in London accounts are covered by Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) limits of £75 thousand or\napproximately $0.1 million per institution. At December 31, 2023, the Company had cash balances in excess of FSCS coverage of approximately $1.4 million. Concentrations of credit risk\nwith accounts receivable are mitigated by the Company’s large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographical areas. The Company performs ongoing\ncredit evaluations of its clients and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization, based upon the shorter of the estimated useful lives (ranging from two to seven years) of the assets or\nterms of the leases, are computed by use of the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized based upon the shorter of the terms of the leases or asset lives. When\nproperty and equipment are retired or sold, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the related accounts and gains or losses, if any, are reflected in\nthe consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If it\nis determined that impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment is charged to operations. No such events or changes in circumstances were noted for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The\nCompany’s intangible assets other than goodwill consist of trademarks and trade name. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization, but rather to\nan annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair-value based test. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating fair value and performing goodwill impairment tests.\nThere were no changes to the $7.5 million carrying amount of goodwill during 2022 or 2023. There were no changes to the carrying amount of $8.5 million trademarks and trade\nnames intangible assets during 2022 or 2023.\nNo asset impairment charges were incurred relating to the Company’s goodwill or intangible assets during 2022 and 2023.\nThe process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires the Company to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analysis. A\nqualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, and overall financial performance. If after\nperforming this assessment, the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company performs the\nquantitative test. Under the quantitative test, a goodwill impairment is identified by comparing the fair value to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds\nthe fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nAt least annually, the Company assesses whether the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their fair value and, if necessary, records an impairment loss\nequal to any such excess. Declines in the Company’s stock price could result in future goodwill impairment charges. The Company sometimes utilizes an independent valuation specialist\nto assist with the determination of fair value. Each interim reporting period, the Company assesses whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying\namount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an asset impairment charge will be recognized in an amount equal\nto that excess. No such events or changes in circumstances were noted for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDue to Models\nDue to models represents the liability for amounts owed to talent for jobs that have taken place, but where the model or talent fee has not yet been paid, typically due to the\nCompany awaiting receipt of payment from the customer. The due to model liabilities are accrued in the period in which the event takes place consistent with when the revenue is\nrecognized. The Company’s contractual agreements with models typically condition payment to talent after the collection of fees from the customer.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a basis net of model costs, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross amounts billed to customers inclusive of model\ncosts. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models appear large relative to total revenue.\nF-12\nContract Liabilities\nWe record deferred revenue, which is a contract liability, when we have entered into a contract with a customer and cash payments are received prior to satisfaction of the related\nperformance obligation.\nAdvertising\nThe Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense, included in office and general expense in the consolidated statements of income and\ncomprehensive income, was $21 thousand and $22 thousand in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred\nincome tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered\nor settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company continually\nassesses the need for a tax valuation allowance based on all available information.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements requires a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial\nstatement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Also, consideration should be given to de-recognition, classification, interest and\npenalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Tax positions are subject to change in the future, as a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which\nan established reserve is audited and finally resolved. Federal tax returns for tax years 2020 through 2022 remained open for examination as of December 31, 2023.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company utilizes share-based awards as a form of compensation for certain officers. The Company records compensation expense for all awards granted. The Company\nuses the Black-Scholes valuation model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the grants.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” (“ASC 820”), for financial assets and financial liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value,\nestablishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies to all financial instruments that are being measured\nand reported on a fair value basis. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in valuation methodologies into the following three levels:\n• Level 1 Inputs-Unadjusted: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 Inputs-Observable: inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that\nare observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n• Level 3 Inputs-Unobservable: inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities\ninclude financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or other valuation techniques, as well as instruments for which\nthe determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nF-13\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 “Financial Instruments -Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”. ASU 2016-13\nreplaces the incurred loss impairment model with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable\ninformation to determine credit loss estimates. The primary impact of ASU 2016-13 relates to the Company’s assessment of its allowance of doubtful accounts on trade receivables. The\nguidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2023,\nand the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”. This ASU requires disclosure of\nincremental segment information on an annual and interim basis, primarily through enhanced disclosures of segment expenses. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the update should be applied retrospectively to each\nperiod presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which expands income tax disclosure requirements\nto include disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as a information on income taxes paid. The standard is effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the updated should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective application permitted in the financial\nstatements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 3. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was comprised of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFurniture and fixtures $ 325 $ 422\nComputer and equipment 433 1,033\nLeasehold improvements 96 68\nTotal 854 1,523\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (534) (1,216)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 320 $ 307\nDuring 2023, $0.8 million of fully depreciated assets were disposed compared to $3.0 million during 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, depreciation expense\ntotaled $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to new assets in service in 2023.\nNote 4. Leases\nThe Company is obligated under non-cancelable lease agreements for the rental of office space and various other lease agreements for the leasing of office equipment. These\noperating leases expire at various dates through 2030. In addition to the minimum base rent, the office space lease agreements provide that the Company shall pay its pro-rata share of real\nestate taxes and operating costs as defined in the lease agreements. The Company also leases certain corporate office facilities from an affiliate.\nDuring 2023, $0.1 million of lease payments were classified as amortization expense, and included within cash used in financing activities on the Company’s statement of cash\nflows. At December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 5.1 years for operating leases and 4.4 years for finance type leases. At December 31, 2023, the weighted\naverage discount rate was 6.2% for operating leases and 7.8% for finance type leases.\nF-14\nThe following table presents additional information regarding the Company’s financing and operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nYear ended Year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFinance lease expense\nAmortization of ROU assets $ 56 $ 64\nInterest on lease liabilities 7 8\nOperating lease expense 916 608\nShort term lease expense 221 353\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities for finance leases\nFinancing cash flows 63 68\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities for operating leases\nOperating cash flows 681 523\nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities\nFinance leases 123 -\nOperating leases 579 2,341\nAs of December 31, 2023, future maturities of lease liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\nOperating Finance\n2024 $ 926 $ 43\n2025 959 43\n2026 907 42\n2027 574 30\n2028 488 25\nThereafter 634 -\nTotal 4,488 183\nLess: Present value discount (674) (29)\nLease liability $ 3,814 $ 154\nThe following table summarizes future minimum payments under the current lease agreements:\nYears Ending Amount\nDecember 31 (in thousands)\n2024 $ 1,120\n2025 1,002\n2026 949\n2027 605\n2028 513\nThereafter 634\nTotal $ 4,823\nRent expense totaled approximately $1.1 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nF-15\nNote 5. Commitments and Contingencies\nOn October 24, 2013, a putative class action lawsuit was brought against the Company by former Wilhelmina model Alex Shanklin and others, including Louisa Raske, Carina\nVretman, Grecia Palomares and Michelle Griffin Trotter (the “Shanklin Litigation”), in New York State Supreme Court (New York County) by the same lead counsel who represented\nplaintiffs in a prior, now-dismissed action brought by Louisa Raske (the “Raske Litigation”). The claims in the Shanklin Litigation initially included breach of contract and unjust\nenrichment allegations arising out of matters similar to the Raske Litigation, such as the handling and reporting of funds on behalf of models and the use of model images. Other\nparties named as defendants in the Shanklin Litigation included other model management companies, advertising firms, and certain advertisers. On January 6, 2014, the Company moved\nto dismiss the Amended Complaint in the Shanklin Litigation for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and other grounds, and other defendants also filed motions to\ndismiss. On August 11, 2014, the court denied the motion to dismiss as to Wilhelmina and other of the model management defendants. Separately, on March 3, 2014, the judge assigned\nto the Shanklin Litigation wrote the Office of the New York Attorney General bringing the case to its attention, generally describing the claims asserted therein against the model\nmanagement defendants, and stating that the case “may involve matters in the public interest.” The judge’s letter also enclosed a copy of his decision in the Raske Litigation, which\ndismissed that case.\nPlaintiffs retained substitute counsel, who filed a Second and then Third Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint asserts causes of action for alleged breaches\nof the plaintiffs' management contracts with the defendants, conversion, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. The Third Amended Complaint also\nalleges that the plaintiff models were at all relevant times employees, and not independent contractors, of the model management defendants, and that defendants violated the New York\nLabor Law in several respects, including, among other things, by allegedly failing to pay the models the minimum wages and overtime pay required thereunder, not maintaining accurate\npayroll records, and not providing plaintiffs with full explanations of how their wages and deductions therefrom were computed. The Third Amended Complaint seeks certification of the\naction as a class action, damages in an amount to be determined at trial, plus interest, costs, attorneys’ fees, and such other relief as the court deems proper. On October 6, 2015,\nWilhelmina filed a motion to dismiss as to most of the plaintiffs’ claims. The Court entered a decision granting in part and denying in part Wilhelmina’s motion to dismiss on May 26,\n2017. The Court (i) dismissed three of the five New York Labor Law causes of action, along with the conversion, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment\ncauses of action, in their entirety, and (ii) permitted only the breach of contract causes of action, and some plaintiffs’ remaining two New York Labor Law causes of action to continue,\nwithin a limited time frame. The plaintiffs and Wilhelmina each appealed, and the decision was affirmed on May 24, 2018. On August 16, 2017, Wilhelmina timely filed its Answer to the\nThird Amended Complaint.\nOn June 6, 2016, another putative class action lawsuit was brought against the Company by former Wilhelmina model Shawn Pressley and others, including Roberta Little (the\n“Pressley Litigation”), in New York State Supreme Court (New York County) by the same counsel representing the plaintiffs in the Shanklin Litigation, and asserting identical, although\nmore recent, claims as those in the Shanklin Litigation. The Amended Complaint, asserting essentially the same types of claims as in the Shanklin action, was filed on August 16, 2017.\nWilhelmina filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on September 29, 2017, which was granted in part and denied in part on May 10, 2018. Some New York Labor Law and\ncontract claims remain in the case. Pressley has withdrawn from the case, leaving Roberta Little as the sole remaining named plaintiff in the Pressley Litigation. On July 12, 2019, the\nCompany filed its Answer and Counterclaim against Little.\nOn May 1, 2019, the Plaintiffs in the Shanklin Litigation (except Raske) and the Pressley Litigation filed motions for class certification on their contract claims and the remaining\nNew York Labor Law Claims. On July 12, 2019, Wilhelmina filed its opposition to the motions for class certification and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment against Shanklin,\nVretman, Palomares, Trotter and Little, and a motion for summary judgment against Raske.\nBy Order dated May 8, 2020 (the “Class Certification Order”), the Court denied class certification in the Pressley case, denied class certification with respect to the breach of\ncontract and alleged unpaid usage claims, granted class certification as to the New York Labor Law causes of action asserted by Vretman, Palomares, and Trotter, and declined to rule on\nWilhelmina’s motions for summary judgment, denying them without prejudice to be re-filed at a later date. Currently the parties are engaging in merits discovery.\nThe Company believes the claims asserted in the Shanklin Litigation and Pressley Litigation are without merit and intends to continue to vigorously defend the actions.\nNonetheless, an adverse outcome in either case is at least reasonably possible. However, the Company is presently unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible loss in\neither case. Therefore, no amount has been accrued as of December 31, 2023 related to these matters.\nIn addition to the legal proceedings disclosed herein, the Company is also engaged in various legal proceedings that are routine in nature and incidental to its business. None of\nthese routine proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, are believed likely, in the Company's opinion, to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or\nits results of operations.\nF-16\nNote 6. Income Taxes\nThe following table summarizes the income tax (expense) benefit for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 40 $ (62)\nState (61) (47)\nForeign (7) -\nCurrent Total (28) (109)\nDeferred:\nFederal (258) 1,057\nState (20) 6\nForeign 48 -\nDeferred Total (230) 1,063\nTotal $ (258) $ 954\nThe income tax (expense) benefit differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rates to the net income before income tax. The\nfollowing table shows the reasons for these differences (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nComputed income tax expense at statutory rate $ (187) $ (540)\nDecrease (increase) in taxes resulting from:\nPermanent and other deductions, net 55 (12)\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income - (80)\nForeign income taxes (61) 196\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit (46) (104)\nDeferred tax effects (19) -\nValuation allowance - 1,494\nTotal income tax (expense) benefit $ (258) $ 954\nEffective tax rate 37.3% (34.9%)\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 37.3% and -34.9% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The income tax benefit in 2022 and low effective tax rate was primarily\nthe result of the full release of a previous $1.5 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.\nGenerally, the Company’s combined effective tax rate is high relative to reported income before taxes as a result of certain amortization expense and stock based compensation\nnot being deductible and income being attributable to certain states in which it operates. In recent years, the majority of taxes paid by the Company were state and foreign taxes, not U.S.\nfederal taxes. The Company operates in three states which have relatively high tax rates: California, New York, and Florida. Realization of net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax\ncredits, and other deferred tax temporary differences are contingent upon future taxable earnings. The Company’s deferred tax assets are reviewed for expected utilization by assessing\nthe available positive and negative factors surrounding recoverability, including projected future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, tax-planning\nstrategies, and results of recent operations. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. There was no valuation\nallowance at December 31, 2023. The Company will continue to assess the evidence used to determine the need for a valuation allowance if warranted by changes in estimated future\nincome and other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no federal income tax loss carryforwards.\nF-17\nThe following table shows the tax effect of significant temporary differences, which comprise the deferred tax asset and liability (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax asset:\nNet operating loss carryforward $ 84 $ 63\nForeign tax credits 184 474\nAccrued expenses 660 573\nAllowance for doubtful accounts 124 82\nLease liability 1,026 1,008\nShare-based compensation 141 117\nOther intangible assets 1 11\nTotal deferred income tax asset 2,220 2,328\nDeferred tax liability:\nProperty and equipment (83) (77)\nRight of use asset (930) (971)\nIntangible assets-trade name (1,197) (1,183)\nGoodwill (455) (395)\nOther intangible assets (770) (687)\nTotal deferred income tax liability (3,435) (3,313)\nDeferred income tax, net $ (1,215) $ (985)\nNet deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as noncurrent within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of\ntemporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid\nor recovered. The Company recognizes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. In making this determination, all\npositive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, future taxable income, and taxable income in\nprior carryback years.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had no U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and $0.5 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards which expire between 2023 and 2031.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had no U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and has $0.2 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards which expire between 2027 and 2031.\nThe Company does not believe that it had any significant uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nor is this expected to change within the next\ntwelve months due to the settlement and expiration of statutes of limitation.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act\nreduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global\nintangible low-taxed income tax and base erosion tax, respectively. In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income\n(“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The Company elected\nto treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.\nNote 7. Treasury Stock\nDuring 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby the Company could repurchase up to 500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock.\nDuring 2013, the Board of Directors renewed and extended the Company’s share repurchase authority to enable it to repurchase up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock.\nIn 2016, the Board of Directors increased by an additional 500,000 shares the number of shares of the Company’s common stock, which may be repurchased under its stock repurchase\nprogram to an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prices the Company\ndeems appropriate. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company’s\ndiscretion.\nF-18\nFrom 2012 through December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 1,314,694 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $4.85 per share, for a\ntotal of approximately $6.4 million in repurchases under the stock repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2023, no shares were repurchased. The repurchase of an\nadditional 185,306 shares is presently authorized under the stock repurchase program.\nNote 8. Related Parties\nThe Executive Chairman of the Company, Mark E. Schwarz, is also the chairman, chief executive officer and portfolio manager of Newcastle Capital Management, L.P. (“NCM”).\nNCM is the general partner of Newcastle Partners L.P. (“Newcastle”), which is the largest shareholder of the Company.\nThe Company’s corporate headquarters are located at the offices of NCM. The Company utilizes NCM facilities on a month-to-month basis at $2.5 thousand per month, pursuant\nto a services agreement entered into between the parties. The Company incurred expenses pursuant to the services agreement totaling $30 thousand for each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company did not owe NCM any amounts under the services agreement as of December 31, 2023.\nNote 9. Stock Options and Stock Purchase Warrants\nDuring 2015, shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Incentive Plan which authorized the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of the common stock pursuant to stock\noptions, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and other equity incentives awarded to directors, officers, consultants, advisors and employees of the Company. Stock option awards\nunder the 2015 Incentive Plan are granted at the market value of the common stock on the date of grant, vest over service periods of one to five years and terminate not more than ten\nyears from the date of grant.\nUnder the 2015 Incentive Plan, no stock option awards were granted during 2023 or 2022. No stock options were exercised during either 2023 or 2022.\nThe following table shows a summary of stock option transactions under the 2015 Incentive Plan during 2023 and 2022:\nWeighted\nAverage\nNumber Exercise\nof Shares Price\nOutstanding, January 1, 2022 180,000 $ 5.93\nGranted - -\nExercised - -\nForfeited or expired - -\nOutstanding, December 31, 2022 180,000 $ 5.93\nGranted - -\nExercised - -\nForfeited or expired - -\nOutstanding, December 31, 2023 180,000 $ 5.93\nWeighted average remaining contractual life was 4.85 years at December 31, 2023 and 5.85 years at December 31, 2022. The exercise price of all stock options was above the\nmarket value at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Therefore, there is no intrinsic value at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Total unrecognized compensation expense on options outstanding\nas of December 31, 2023 was $50 thousand. Options to purchase 137,000 shares of common stock were exercisable as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each stock option granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on the\nhistorical volatility of Wilhelmina’s and similar companies’ common stock for a period equal to the expected term. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the contractual term of the\noptions are based on rates for U.S. Treasury Notes with maturity dates corresponding to the options’ expected lives on the dates of grant. Expected term is determined based on the\noption term.\nF-19\nNo stock options were granted during 2023 and 2022.\nNote 10. Benefit Plans\nThe Company has established a 401(k) Plan for eligible employees of the Company. Generally, all employees of the Company who are at least twenty-one years of age are eligible\nto participate in the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan is a defined contribution plan, which provides that participants may make voluntary salary deferral contributions, on a pretax basis,\nbetween 1% and 100% of their compensation in the form of voluntary payroll deductions, up to a maximum amount as indexed for cost-of-living adjustments. The Company may make\ndiscretionary contributions. No discretionary contributions were made during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nF-20\nExhibit 14.1\nWILHELMINA INTERNATIONAL INC. CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS\nThis Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) sets forth legal and ethical standards of conduct for directors, officers and employees of Wilhelmina International, Inc.\n(the “Company”). This Code is intended to deter wrongdoing and to promote the conduct of all Company business in accordance with high standards of integrity and in compliance with\nall applicable laws and regulations. This Code applies to the Company and all of its subsidiaries and other business entities controlled by it worldwide.\nIf you have any questions regarding this Code or its application to you in any situation, you should contact your supervisor or the Company’s Corporate Secretary.\nCompliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nThe Company requires that all employees, officers and directors comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company wherever it does business. You are\nexpected to use good judgment and common sense in seeking to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to ask for advice when you are uncertain about them.\nIf you become aware of the violation of any law, rule or regulation by the Company, whether by its officers, employees, directors, or any third party doing business on behalf of\nthe Company, it is your responsibility to promptly report the matter to your supervisor or the Corporate Secretary. While it is the Company’s desire to address matters internally, nothing\nin this Code should discourage you from reporting any illegal activity, including any violation of the securities laws, antitrust laws, and environmental laws or any other federal, state or\nforeign law, rule or regulation, to the appropriate regulatory authority. Employees, officers and directors shall not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass or in any other manner\ndiscriminate or retaliate against an employee because he or she reports any such violation, unless it is determined that the report was made with knowledge that it was false. This Code\nshould not be construed to prohibit you from testifying, participating or otherwise assisting in any state or federal administrative, judicial or legislative proceeding or investigation.\nConflicts of Interest\nEmployees, officers and directors must act in the best interests of the Company. You must refrain from engaging in any activity or having a personal interest that presents a\n“conflict of interest.” A conflict of interest occurs when your personal interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company. A conflict of interest can arise\nwhenever you, as an officer, director or employee, take action or have an interest that prevents you from performing your Company duties and responsibilities honestly, objectively and\neffectively.\nFor example:\n• No employee, officer or director shall perform services as a consultant, employee, officer, director, advisor or in any other capacity for, or have a financial interest in, a\ndirect competitor of the Company, other than services performed at the request of the Company and other than a financial interest representing less than one percent (1%)\nof the outstanding shares of a publicly-held company; and\n• No employee, officer or director shall use his or her position with the Company to influence a transaction with a supplier or customer in which such person has any\npersonal interest, other than a financial interest representing less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of a publicly-held company.\nIt is your responsibility to disclose any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest to the Corporate Secretary or, if\nyou are an executive officer or director, to the Board of Directors, who shall be responsible for determining whether such transaction or relationship constitutes a conflict of interest.\nInsider Trading\nEmployees, officers and directors who have material non-public information about the Company or other companies, including our suppliers and customers, as a result of their\nrelationship with the Company are prohibited by law and Company policy from trading in securities of the Company or such other companies, as well as from communicating such\ninformation to others who might trade on the basis of that information.\nIf you are uncertain about the constraints on your purchase or sale of any Company securities or the securities of any other company that you are familiar with by virtue of your\nrelationship with the Company, you should consult with the Corporate Secretary before making any such purchase or sale.\nConfidentiality\nEmployees, officers and directors must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the Company or other companies, including our suppliers\nand customers, except when disclosure is authorized by a supervisor or legally mandated. Unauthorized disclosure of any confidential information is prohibited. Additionally, employees\nshould take appropriate precautions to ensure that confidential or sensitive business information, whether it is proprietary to the Company or another company, is not communicated\nwithin the Company except to employees who have a need to know such information to perform their responsibilities for the Company.\nThird parties may ask you for information concerning the Company. Employees, officers and directors (other than the Company’s authorized spokespersons) must not discuss\ninternal Company matters with, or disseminate internal Company information to, anyone outside the Company, except as required in the performance of their Company duties and after an\nappropriate confidentiality agreement is in place. This prohibition applies particularly to inquiries concerning the Company from the media, market professionals (such as securities\nanalysts, institutional investors, investment advisers, brokers and dealers) and security holders. All responses to inquiries on behalf of the Company must be made only by the\nCompany’s authorized spokespersons. If you receive any inquiries of this nature, you must decline to comment and refer the inquirer to your supervisor or one of the Company’s\nauthorized spokespersons.\nYou also must abide by any lawful obligations that you have to your former employer. These obligations may include restrictions on the use and disclosure of confidential\ninformation, restrictions on the solicitation of former colleagues to work at the Company and non-competition obligations.\nHonest and Ethical Conduct and Fair Dealing\nEmployees, officers and directors should endeavor to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with the Company’s suppliers, customers, competitors and employees. Statements\nregarding the Company’s products and services must not be untrue, misleading, deceptive or fraudulent. You must not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation,\nconcealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.\nProtection and Proper Use of Corporate Assets\nEmployees, officers and directors should seek to protect the Company’s assets. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s financial performance.\nEmployees, officers and directors must use the Company’s assets and services solely for legitimate business purposes of the Company and not for any personal benefit or the personal\nbenefit of anyone else.\nEmployees, officers and directors must advance the Company’s legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. You must not take for yourself personal opportunities\nthat are discovered through your position with the Company or the use of property or information of the Company.\nPage 2\nGifts and Gratuities\nThe use of Company funds or assets for gifts, gratuities or other favors to employees or government officials is prohibited, except to the extent such gifts are in compliance with\napplicable law, nominal in amount and not given in consideration or expectation of any action by the recipient. Employees, officers and directors must not accept, or permit any member of\nhis or her immediate family to accept, any gifts, gratuities or other favors from any customer, supplier or other person doing or seeking to do business with the Company, other than items\nof nominal value. Any promotional items or gifts with a reasonably estimated value in excess of $50 should be returned immediately and reported to the Corporate Secretary. If immediate\nreturn is not practical, they should be given to the Company for charitable disposition or such other disposition as the Company believes appropriate in its sole discretion.\nCommon sense and moderation should prevail in business entertainment engaged in on behalf of the Company. Employees, officers and directors should provide, or accept,\nbusiness entertainment to or from anyone doing business with the Company only if the entertainment is infrequent, modest and intended to serve legitimate business goals.\nBribes and kickbacks are criminal acts, strictly prohibited by law.

McCarthy\nName: James A. McCarthy\nTitle: Chief Financial Officer\n(principal financial officer)\nExhibit 97.1\nWILHELMINA INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nPolicy Regarding Recovery of Excessive Incentive Based Compensation\nThis Clawback Policy (this “Policy”) has been adopted by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Wilhelmina, Inc. (the “Company”) in light of the effective date of October 10,\n2023 (the “Effective Date”) of the listing requirements adopted by the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) in the form of Listing Rule 5608 (“Rule 5608”) that implements the\nincentive-based compensation recovery requirements set forth in Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as added by Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This Policy shall be filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to Item 601(b)(97) of Regulation S-K.\n1.Recovery of Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation. In the event that following the Effective Date the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement that (i)\ncorrects errors that are material to previously issued financial statements or (ii) corrects errors that are not material to previously issued financial statements but would result in a\nmaterial misstatement if the error were recorded in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (either such event, a “Triggering Event”), the Company will use\nreasonable efforts to recover, subject to the terms of this Policy, from any current or former Executive Officer of the Company who was paid or granted Incentive-Based\nCompensation on or after the Effective Date, all Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation.\n2.Exceptional Circumstances. Should the recovery of Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation be impractical due to either (i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in\nenforcing the policy exceeding the amount to be recovered or (ii) such recovery causing a broad-based retirement plan to fail to meet the tax-qualification requirements of 26 U.S.C.\n401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a), then the Board may determine not to pursue such recovery so long as the Company has made a reasonable attempt to effect such recovery and\nprovided supporting documentation regarding such efforts to NASDAQ.\n3.Definitions. For purposes of this Policy, the following terms have the meanings indicated, in addition to the other terms defined herein:\n“Executive Officer” means all individuals appointed as such for purposes of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by the Board of Directors.\n“Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation” means the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation paid or granted by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company to an\nExecutive Officer on or after the Effective Date in excess of what would have been paid or granted to that Executive Officer under the circumstances reflected by the\naccounting restatement, in the reasonable judgement of the Board.\n“Financial Reporting Measures” means the measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in the Company’s financial\nstatements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, as well as the Company’s stock price and total shareholder return.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means, with respect to any Executive Officer, any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the\nattainment of any financial reporting measure. For purposes of clarity, equity awards that vest exclusively upon completion of a specified employment period, without any\nperformance condition, and bonus awards that are discretionary or based on subjective goals or goals unrelated to financial reporting measures, do not constitute Incentive\nBased Compensation\n4.Process. Following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the Board, after considering the recommendations of the Compensation Committee of the Board, will review each\nExecutive Officer’s Incentive-Based Compensation and take prompt and reasonable action in accordance with this Policy to seek recovery of all Excessive Incentive-Based\nCompensation. There shall be no duplication of recovery under this Policy and any of 15 U.S.C. Section 7243 (Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) or Section 10D of the\nExchange Act.\n5.Interpretation of this Policy; Determinations by the Board. The Board may at any time in its sole discretion supplement or amend any provision of this Policy in any respect,\nrepeal this Policy in whole or part or adopt a new policy relating to recovery of incentive-based compensation with such terms as the Board determines in its sole discretion to be\nappropriate. The Board has the exclusive power and authority to administer this Policy, including, without limitation, the right and power to interpret the provisions of this Policy\nand to make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of this Policy, including, without limitation, any determination as to (a) whether a Triggering\nEvent has occurred; and (b) what constitutes Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation. All such actions, interpretations and determinations that are taken or made by the Board in\ngood faith will be final, conclusive, and binding.\n6.Limitation on Period for Recovery. The Board may seek recovery of any Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation received in the three (3) completed fiscal years preceding the\naccounting restatement if the Board determines that the Company is required to prepare the accounting restatement due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any\nfinancial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws. For purposes of determining when any such Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation was received by any\nExecutive Officer, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based\nCompensation award is attained, even if the grant or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. For Incentive-Based Compensation based\non stock price or total shareholder return, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors can use a reasonable estimate of the effect of the restatement on the applicable\nmeasure to determine the amount to be recovered.\n7.Other Recoupment Rights. The Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award\nagreement, or similar agreement, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require an Executive Officer to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of\nrecoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any\nsimilar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.\n8.No Indemnification of Executive Officers. The Company shall not indemnify any Executive Officer against the loss of any erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation,\nincluding any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Executive Officer to fund potential clawback obligations under this Policy.\n9.Administrator Indemnification. No member of the Board who assists in the administration of this Policy, shall be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation\nmade with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action,\ndetermination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy.\n10.Effective Date. This Policy shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation that is received, as determined pursuant to Rule 5608), on or after the Effective Date."

The\nCompany considers Gross Billings, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Corporate EBITDA to be important measures of performance\nbecause they:\n• are key operating metrics of the Company's business;\n• are used by management in its planning and budgeting processes and to monitor and evaluate its financial and operating results;\nand\n• provide stockholders and potential investors with a means to evaluate the Company's financial and operating results against other\ncompanies within the Company's industry.\nThe Company's calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be consistent with similar calculations by other companies\nin the Company's industry. The Company calculates Gross Billings as the gross amounts billed to customers on behalf of its models and\ntalent for services performed. The Company calculates EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, and\ndepreciation and amortization expense. The Company calculates “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA plus foreign exchange gain/loss,\nshare-based payment expense and certain significant non-recurring items that the Company may include from time to time. There were\nno such non-recurring items during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company calculates “Pre-Corporate\nEBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA plus corporate overhead expense, which includes director compensation, securities laws compliance\ncosts, audit and professional fees, and other public company costs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net and operating income as an indicator of the\nCompany's operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other measure of performance\nderived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nForm 10-Q Filing\nAdditional information concerning the Company's results of operations and financial position is included in the Company's Form\n10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, 2024.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995.

The Company considers\nGross Billings, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Corporate EBITDA to be important measures of performance because they:\nare key operating metrics of the Company's business;\nare used by management in its planning and budgeting processes and to monitor and evaluate its financial and operating results; and\nprovide stockholders and potential investors with a means to evaluate the Company's financial and operating results against other\ncompanies within the Company's industry.\nThe Company's calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be consistent with similar calculations by other companies in the\nCompany's industry. The Company calculates Gross Billings as the gross amount billed to customers on behalf of its models and talent for\nservices performed. The Company calculates EBITDA as net income plus interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, and\ndepreciation and amortization expense. The Company calculates “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA plus foreign exchange gain/loss, share-\nbased payment expense and certain significant non-recurring items that the Company may include from time to time. There were no such\nnon-recurring items during 2023 and 2022. The Company calculates “Pre-Corporate EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA plus corporate\noverhead expense, which includes director compensation, securities laws compliance costs, audit and professional fees, and other public\ncompany costs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net and operating income as an indicator of the Company's\noperating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other measure of performance derived in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nForm 10-K Filing\nAdditional information concerning the Company's results of operations and financial position is included in the Company's Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 26, 2024.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995. Such forward-looking statements relating to the Company are based on the beliefs of the Company’s management as well as\ninformation currently available to the Company’s management.

Basis of Presentation\nThe interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Wilhelmina International, Inc. (together\nwith its subsidiaries, “Wilhelmina” or the “Company”) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). Although certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted\npursuant to those rules and regulations, all adjustments considered necessary in order to make the consolidated financial statements not\nmisleading have been included. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying interim unaudited consolidated\nfinancial statements reflect all adjustments, of a normal recurring nature, that are necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income, statements of shareholders’ equity, and cash flows\nfor the periods presented. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023. Results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected\nfor any other interim periods or the full fiscal year.\nNote 2. Business Activity\nThe primary business of Wilhelmina is fashion model management. These business operations are headquartered in New York\nCity. The Company’s predecessor was founded in 1967 by Wilhelmina Cooper, a renowned fashion model, and became one of the\noldest, best known and largest fashion model management companies in the world.

Foreign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our subsidiary in the United Kingdom is the British Pound. Assets and liabilities are translated into\nU.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using the weighted average\nexchange rates during reporting periods. Related translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholder’s\nequity and transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income when\nrealized.\nNote 4. Commitments and Contingencies\nOn October 24, 2013, a putative class action lawsuit was brought against the Company by former Wilhelmina model Alex\nShanklin and others, including Louisa Raske, Carina Vretman, Grecia Palomares and Michelle Griffin Trotter (the “Shanklin\nLitigation”), in New York State Supreme Court (New York County) by the same lead counsel who represented plaintiffs in a prior, now-\ndismissed action brought by Louisa Raske (the “Raske Litigation”). The claims in the Shanklin Litigation initially included breach of\ncontract and unjust enrichment allegations arising out of matters similar to the Raske Litigation, such as the handling and reporting of\nfunds on behalf of models and the use of model images. Other parties named as defendants in the Shanklin Litigation included other\nmodel management companies, advertising firms, and certain advertisers. On January 6, 2014, the Company moved to dismiss the\nAmended Complaint in the Shanklin Litigation for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and other grounds, and other\ndefendants also filed motions to dismiss. On August 11, 2014, the court denied the motion to dismiss as to Wilhelmina and other of the\nmodel management defendants. Separately, on March 3, 2014, the judge assigned to the Shanklin Litigation wrote the Office of the New\nYork Attorney General bringing the case to its attention, generally describing the claims asserted therein against the model management\ndefendants, and stating that the case “may involve matters in the public interest.” The judge’s letter also enclosed a copy of his decision\nin the Raske Litigation, which dismissed that case.\nPlaintiffs retained substitute counsel, who filed a Second and then Third Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs’ Third Amended\nComplaint asserts causes of action for alleged breaches of the plaintiffs' management contracts with the defendants, conversion, breach\nof the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. The Third Amended Complaint also alleges that the plaintiff models\nwere at all relevant times employees, and not independent contractors, of the model management defendants, and that defendants violated\nthe New York Labor Law in several respects, including, among other things, by allegedly failing to pay the models the minimum wages\nand overtime pay required thereunder, not maintaining accurate payroll records, and not providing plaintiffs with full explanations of\nhow their wages and deductions therefrom were computed. The Third Amended Complaint seeks certification of the action as a class\naction, damages in an amount to be determined at trial, plus interest, costs, attorneys’ fees, and such other relief as the court deems\nproper. On October 6, 2015, Wilhelmina filed a motion to dismiss as to most of the plaintiffs’ claims. The Court entered a decision\ngranting in part and denying in part Wilhelmina’s motion to dismiss on May 26, 2017. The Court (i) dismissed three of the five New\nYork Labor Law causes of action, along with the conversion, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment\ncauses of action, in their entirety, and (ii) permitted only the breach of contract causes of action, and some plaintiffs’ remaining two\nNew York Labor Law causes of action to continue, within a limited time frame. The plaintiffs and Wilhelmina each appealed, and the\ndecision was affirmed on May 24, 2018. On August 16, 2017, Wilhelmina timely filed its Answer to the Third Amended Complaint.\nOn June 6, 2016, another putative class action lawsuit was brought against the Company by former Wilhelmina model Shawn\nPressley and others, including Roberta Little (the “Pressley Litigation”), in New York State Supreme Court (New York County) by the\nsame counsel representing the plaintiffs in the Shanklin Litigation, and asserting identical, although more recent, claims as those in the\nShanklin Litigation. The Amended Complaint, asserting essentially the same types of claims as in the Shanklin action, was filed on\nAugust 16, 2017. Wilhelmina filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on September 29, 2017, which was granted in part and\ndenied in part on May 10, 2018. Some New York Labor Law and contract claims remain in the case. Pressley has withdrawn from the\ncase, leaving Roberta Little as the sole remaining named plaintiff in the Pressley Litigation. On July 12, 2019, the Company filed its\nAnswer and Counterclaim against Little.\nOn May 1, 2019, the Plaintiffs in the Shanklin Litigation (except Raske) and the Pressley Litigation filed motions for class\ncertification on their contract claims and the remaining New York Labor Law Claims. On July 12, 2019, Wilhelmina filed its opposition\nto the motions for class certification and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment against Shanklin, Vretman, Palomares, Trotter and\nLittle, and a motion for summary judgment against Raske.\nBy Order dated May 8, 2020 (the “Class Certification Order”), the Court denied class certification in the Pressley case, denied\nclass certification with respect to the breach of contract and alleged unpaid usage claims, granted class certification as to the New York\nLabor Law causes of action asserted by Vretman, Palomares and Trotter, and declined to rule on Wilhelmina’s motions for summary\njudgment, denying them without prejudice to be re-filed at a later date. Currently the parties are engaging in merits discovery.\nThe Company believes the claims asserted in the Shanklin Litigation and Pressley Litigation are without merit and intends to\ncontinue to vigorously defend the actions. Nonetheless, an adverse outcome in either case is at least reasonably possible. However, the\nCompany is presently unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible loss in either case. Therefore, no amount has been\naccrued as of March 31, 2024 related to these matters.\nIn addition to the legal proceedings disclosed herein, the Company is also engaged in various legal proceedings that are routine\nin nature and incidental to its business. None of these routine proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, are believed likely, in\nthe Company's opinion, to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or its results of operations.\nNote 5. Income Taxes\nGenerally, the Company’s combined effective tax rate is high relative to reported income before taxes as a result of certain\namortization expense, stock based compensation, and corporate overhead not being deductible and income being attributable to certain\nstates in which it operates. In recent years, the majority of taxes paid by the Company were state and foreign taxes, not U.S. federal\ntaxes. The Company operates in three states which have relatively high tax rates: California, New York, and Florida. Realization of net\noperating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, and other deferred tax temporary differences are contingent upon future taxable\nearnings. The Company’s deferred tax assets are reviewed for expected utilization by assessing the available positive and negative\nfactors surrounding recoverability, including projected future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, tax-\nplanning strategies, and results of recent operations. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred\ntax asset will not be realized. The Company will continue to assess the evidence used to determine the need for a valuation allowance if\nwarranted by changes in estimated future income and other factors.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had no federal income tax loss carryforwards.\nNote 6. Treasury Shares\nDuring 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby the Company could repurchase up to\n500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. During 2013, the Board of Directors renewed and extended the Company’s share\nrepurchase authority to enable it to repurchase up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock. In 2016, the Board of Directors\nincreased by an additional 500,000 shares the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be repurchased under its\nstock repurchase program to an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or\nthrough privately negotiated transactions at prices the Company deems appropriate. The program does not obligate the Company to\nacquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion.\nFrom 2012 through March 31, 2024, the Company had repurchased 1,314,694 shares of common stock at an average price of\napproximately $4.85 per share, for a total of approximately $6.4 million in repurchases under the stock repurchase program. During the\nfirst three months of 2024, no shares were repurchased under the stock repurchase program.\nNote 7. Related Parties\nThe Executive Chairman of the Company, Mark E. Schwarz, is also the chairman, chief executive officer and portfolio manager\nof Newcastle Capital Management, L.P. (“NCM”). NCM is the general partner of Newcastle Partners L.P. (“Newcastle”), which is the\nlargest shareholder of the Company.\nThe Company’s corporate headquarters are located at the offices of NCM. The Company utilizes NCM facilities on a month-\nto-month basis at $2.5 thousand per month, pursuant to a services agreement entered into between the parties. The Company incurred\nexpenses pursuant to the services agreement totaling $7.5 thousand for the three months ended both March 31, 2024 and 2023. The\nCompany did not owe NCM any amounts under the services agreement as of March 31, 2024.\nNote 8. Fair Value Measurements\nA three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable\ninputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best\nevidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\n¥ Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n¥ Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets\nthat are not active, and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable\n¥ Level 3 – Instruments with model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are unobservable\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months\nor less. Short-term investments with maturities of over three and up to twelve months are recorded in Short-term investments on the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents the fair value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and their\ncorresponding level within the fair value hierarchy:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLevel Amount Level Amount\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash $ 4,713 $ 6,107\nMoney market funds 1 21 1 10\nTotal $ 4,734 $ 6,117\nShort-term investments\nUnited States Treasury securities 1 $ 6,670 1 $ 6,596\nTotal $ 6,670 $ 6,596\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 11,404 $ 12,713\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments approximated\ntheir cost.\n! !\nItem 2.

These business operations are headquartered in New York\nCity. The Company’s predecessor was founded in 1967 by Wilhelmina Cooper, a renowned fashion model, and became one of the\noldest, best known and largest fashion model management companies in the world. Since its founding, Wilhelmina has grown to include\noperations located in Los Angeles, Miami, and London, as well as a network of licensees. Wilhelmina provides traditional, full-service\nfashion model and talent management services, specializing in the representation and management of models, entertainers, athletes and\nother talent, to various clients, including retailers, designers, advertising agencies, print and electronic media and catalog companies.\nThe Aperture division operates in New York, Los Angeles and Miami, representing actors and models, for film, television, and\ncommercials. Aperture also represents influencers for brand campaigns and endorsements.\nWilhelmina London Limited (“London”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilhelmina International, Inc., was acquired in January\n2015. The London subsidiary establishes a footprint for the Company in Western Europe, provides a base of operations to service the\nCompany’s European clients, and serves as a new talent development office for European models and artists.\nOrganization and Operating Divisions\nThe Company acquired the predecessor companies constituting its current primary business in 2008. The Company conducts\nits business through operating divisions and subsidiaries engaged in fashion model management and other complementary businesses.\nThese business activities are focused on the following key areas:\n¥ Fashion model and social media influencer management\n¥ Celebrity management\n¥ Licensing and branding associations\nTrends and Opportunities\nThe Company expects that the combination of Wilhelmina’s main operating base in New York City, the industry’s capital, with\nthe depth and breadth of its talent pool and client roster and its diversification across various talent management segments, together with\nits geographical reach, should make Wilhelmina’s operations more resilient to industry changes and economic swings than those of\nmany of the smaller firms operating in the industry.\nWith total annual advertising expenditures on major media (newspapers, magazines, television, cinema, outdoor and Internet)\nestimated to have exceeded $400 billion in recent years, North America the world’s largest advertising market. For the fashion talent\nmanagement industry, including Wilhelmina, advertising expenditures on television, Internet, magazines, and outdoor are of particular\nrelevance.\nTraditional retail clients in the fashion and beauty industry have had increased competition from digital, social, and new media,\nreducing their budgets for advertising and model talent. Wilhelmina reviews the mix of talent and resources available to best operate in\nthis changing environment.\nAlthough Wilhelmina has a large and diverse client base, it is not immune to global economic conditions. The Company closely\nmonitors economic conditions, client spending, and other industry factors and continually evaluates opportunities to increase its market\nshare and further expand its geographic reach. There can be no assurance as to the effects on Wilhelmina of current or future economic\ncircumstances, client spending patterns, client creditworthiness and other developments and whether, or to what extent, Wilhelmina’s\nefforts to respond to them will be effective.\nStrategy\nManagement’s long-term strategy is to increase value to shareholders through the following initiatives:\n¥ increase Wilhelmina’s brand awareness among advertisers and potential talent;\n¥ expand the women’s high end fashion board;\n¥ expand the Aperture division’s representation in commercials, film, and television;\n¥ expand social media influencer representation;\n¥ evaluate opportunities to expand the Wilhelmina network through strategic geographic market development; and\n¥ evaluate opportunities to partner on media projects (television, film, books, etc.).\nThe Company makes use of digital technology to effectively connect with clients and talent, utilizing video conferencing and\nother digital tools to best position our team to identify opportunities to grow the careers of the talent we represent and expand our\nbusiness. The Company has made significant investments in technology, infrastructure, and personnel, to support our clients and talent.\nKey Financial Indicators\nIn addition to net income, the key financial indicators that the Company reviews to monitor its business are revenues, operating\nexpenses, and cash flows.\nThe Company analyzes revenue by reviewing the mix of revenues generated by the different “boards,” each a specific division\nof the fashion model management operations which specializes by the type of model it represents, by geographic locations and from\nsignificant clients. Within its fashion model management business, Wilhelmina’s primary source of service revenue is from model fees\nand service charges paid by the client for bookings directly negotiated by the Company. The Company also receives commissions paid\non bookings by third-party agencies. See “Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.”\nWilhelmina provides professional services. Therefore, salary and service costs represent the largest part of the Company’s\noperating expenses. Salary and service costs are comprised of payroll and related costs and travel, meals and entertainment (“T&E”) to\ndeliver the Company’s services and to enable new business development activities.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Statements of Operations and Service Revenues\nThree Months Ended\n(in thousands) March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 % Change\nService revenues $ 4,163 $ 4,476 (7.0% )\nLicense fees and other income 8 8 0%\nTOTAL REVENUES 4,171 4,484 (7.0% )\nSalaries and service costs 2,966 2,880 3.0%\nOffice and general expenses 835 1,080 (22.7% )\nAmortization and depreciation 44 51 (13.7% )\nCorporate overhead 253 244 3.7%\nOPERATING INCOME 73 229 (68.1% )\nOPERATING MARGIN 1.8% 5.1% (64.7% )\nForeign exchange loss 7 18 (61.1% )\nInterest income (86 ) – –\nInterest expense 3 1 200%\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 149 210 (29.0% )\nCurrent income tax expense (12 ) (56 ) (78.6% )\nDeferred tax expense (46 ) 5 (1020% )\nEffective tax rate 38.9% 24.3% 60.1%\nNET INCOME $ 91 $ 159 (42.8% )\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Information\nThree Months Ended\n(in thousands) March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 % Change\nGross Billings $ 15,824 $ 17,587 (10.1% )\nEBITDA 110 262 (58.0% )\nAdjusted EBITDA 128 304 (57.9% )\nPre Corporate EBITDA 381 548 (30.5% )\nSee pages 15 to 16 for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures\nand for other important information.\ncSeveri evsReenu\nThe Company’s service revenues fluctuate in response to its clients’ willingness to spend on advertising and the Company’s\nability to have the desired talent available. The decrease of 7.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, when compared to the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023, were primarily due to decreased commissions from core model and Aperture bookings.\nceom Inthernd e OFseaei cLens\nLicense fees and other income include franchise revenues from independently owned model agencies that use the Wilhelmina\ntrademark and various services provided by the Company. License fees remained the same for both the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023, primarily due to the aligned timing of income from licensing agreements.\ntsosei cCevrd e SsaniSalar\nSalaries and service costs consist of payroll related costs and T&E required to deliver the Company’s services to its clients and\ntalents. The 3.0% increase in salaries and service costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024, when compared to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023, were primarily due to personnel hires and payroll changes to better align Wilhelmina staffing with the\nneeds of each office and geographical region.\neeEnssx pealr e GncfandOfei\nOffice and general expenses consist of office and equipment rents, legal expenses, advertising and promotion, insurance\nexpenses, administration and technology cost. The decrease in office and general expenses of 22.7% for the three months ended March\n31, 2024, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due to decreased legal expense, computer expenses,\nand other office related expenses.\neprd DtaniontaAiorzm tcioniea\nAmortization and depreciation expense is incurred with respect to certain assets, including computer hardware, software, office\nequipment, furniture, and finance leases. Amortization and depreciation expense decreased by 13.7% for the three months ended March\n31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to reduced depreciation of assets that became fully amortized\nin 2023. Fixed asset purchases (mostly related to technology and computer equipment) totaled approximately $6 thousand during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $73 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nadeher vatOepororC\nCorporate overhead expenses include director and executive officer compensation, legal, audit and professional fees, corporate\noffice rent and travel.

Operating margin decreased to 1.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 5.1% for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023, due to the decrease in revenue outpacing the decrease in operating expenses.\nangex ccEhyernurCgn Feori\nThe Company realized a $7 thousand foreign currency exchange loss during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and loss\nof $18 thousand from foreign currency exchange during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Foreign currency gain and loss is due\nto fluctuations in currencies from Great Britain, Europe, and Latin America.\nencetom sIntIer\nInterest income is primarily attributable to interest from short term investments. Interest income was $86 thousand for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024. There was no interest income in the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nepeEnsetx sInter\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to interest on finance leases.

The lower pre-tax income in 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in operating\nincome.\ne s axTInceom\nGenerally, the Company’s combined effective tax rate is high relative to reported net income as a result of amortization expense,\nforeign taxes, and corporate overhead not being deductible and income being attributable to certain states in which it operates. The\nCompany operates in three states, which have relatively high tax rates: California, New York, and Florida. In addition, foreign taxes in\nthe United Kingdom related to our London office are not deductible from U.S. federal taxes. The Company had income tax expense of\n$0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nceom eNInt\nThe Company had net income of $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of $0.2\nmillion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to the decrease in operating income.\ngsslBosiirnlG\nGross billings is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the gross amount billed to customers on behalf of its clients\n(models and talent) for services performed. Gross billings decreased 10.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, when compared\nto the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to decreased core model bookings with decreased bookings at the Aperture\ndivision. See below and page 16 for more information regarding non-GAAP financial measures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s cash balance decreased to $4.7 million at March 31, 2024 from $6.1 million at December 31, 2023. The cash\nbalances decreased as a result of $1.3 million net cash used in operating activities, $5 thousand net cash used in investing activities, $32\nthousand cash used in financing activities, and the $30 thousand effect of exchange rate on cash flow during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024.\nNet cash used in operating activities of $1.3 million was primarily the result of increases in accounts receivable and prepaid\nexpenses, decreases in amounts due to models, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and lease liabilities, partially offset by net\nincome and an increase in deferred income taxes. The $5 thousand cash used in investing activities was attributable to purchases of short\nterm investments and property and equipment, including furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, software and computer\nequipment, offset by maturities of short term investments. The $32 thousand cash used in financing activities was attributable to\npayments on finance leases.\nThe Company’s primary liquidity needs are for working capital associated with performing services under its client contracts.\nGenerally, the Company incurs significant operating expenses with payment terms shorter than its average collections on billings. Based\non budgeted and year-to-date cash flow information, management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet its projected\noperational expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months and beyond.\nImportant Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provide users of the Company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating\nperformance. The Company considers Gross Billings, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Corporate EBITDA to be important\nmeasures of performance because they are key operating metrics of the Company's business. These metrics are used by management in\nits planning and budgeting processes, to monitor and evaluate its financial and operating results and provide stockholders and potential\ninvestors with a means to evaluate the Company's financial and operating results, and to provide stockholders and potential investors\nwith a means to evaluate the Company’s financial and operating results against other companies within the Company's industry.\nGross Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers on behalf of its models and talent for services performed. The\nCompany calculates Gross Billings as total revenue plus model costs, which includes amounts owed to talent, including taxes required\nto be withheld and remitted directly to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and related costs such as those paid for\nphotography. The Company calculates EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and\namortization expense. The Company calculates “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA plus foreign exchange gain/loss, share-based payment\nexpense and certain significant non-recurring items that the Company may include from time to time. The Company calculates “Pre-\nCorporate EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA plus corporate overhead expense, which includes director compensation, securities laws\ncompliance costs, audit and professional fees, and other public company costs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's\nfinancial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial\nmeasures may be significant items that could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should\ntherefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual and future financial condition and performance.

All significant\ninter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nionniet cRogevReenu\nThe Company has adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”). ASC 606 establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods\nor services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services.\nOur revenues are derived primarily from fashion model bookings, and representation of social media influencers and actors for\ncommercials, film, and television. Our performance obligations are primarily satisfied at a point in time when the talent has completed\nthe contractual requirements.\nA contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the\nperformance obligation is satisfied. The performance obligations for most of the Company’s core modeling bookings are satisfied on\nthe day of the event, and the “day rate” total fee is agreed in advance when the customer books the model for a particular date. For\ncontracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on\nthe estimated relative standalone selling price.\nWe report service revenues on a net basis, which represents gross amounts billed net of amounts owed to talent, including taxes\nrequired to be withheld and remitted directly to taxing authorities, commissions owed to other agencies, and related costs such as those\npaid for photography. The Company typically enters into contractual agreements with models under which the Company is obligated to\npay talent upon collection of fees from the customer.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a net basis, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross amounts billed\nto customers, inclusive of model costs. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models appear large relative to total\nrevenue.\nAmounts billed that have not yet met the applicable revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue within accrued\nexpenses and the related talent costs are recorded as contract liability.\ntionpeaomnsd CBeeasShar\nShare-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value as calculated by the Black-\nScholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight line basis as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally\nthe vesting period. The determination of the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is\naffected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include the\nestimated volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free\ninterest rates, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends.\nInceom esaxT\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, the United Kingdom, and numerous local jurisdictions.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences to the extent\nthat it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Unused tax loss carry-forwards are reviewed\nat each reporting date and a valuation allowance is established if it is doubtful we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize\nthe loss carry-forwards.\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, we take into account whether additional taxes, interest, or\npenalties may be due. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our income taxes, we can provide no assurance that the\nfinal tax outcome will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded, such\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact\non our financial condition and operating results.\ntscAounc ful oubtD feorancwl lo Alandeveabei tcsRcAounc\nAccounts receivable are accounted for at net realizable value, do not bear interest and are short-term in nature. The Company\nmaintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect on accounts receivable. Based\non management’s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to\nthe allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a\ncharge to the allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company generally does not require collateral.\nAlthough service revenues are reported on a basis net of model costs, accounts receivable are recorded at the amount of gross\namounts billed to customers inclusive of model costs. As a result, both accounts receivable and amounts due to models appear large\nrelative to total revenue.\ning eteTsnt mpaieImrt lAsesngi bIntaandl ioodwlG\nThe Company performs impairment testing at least annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the\nasset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nThe Company sometimes utilizes an independent valuation specialist to assist with the determination of fair value. In accordance with\nASU 2017-03, effective January 1, 2020, only a one-step quantitative impairment test is performed, whereby a goodwill impairment\nloss will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s\ngoodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill.\nWhenever events or circumstances change, entities have the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood\nof goodwill impairment. If impairment is deemed more likely than not, management would perform the goodwill impairment test.\nOtherwise, the goodwill impairment test is not required. In assessing the qualitative factors, the Company assesses relevant events and\ncircumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and\ncircumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions.\nThe judgment and assumptions include the identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall\nfinancial performance, Company specific events and share price trends, an assessment of whether each relevant factor will impact the\nimpairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact.\nThe Company evaluates indefinite lived trademark and trade name intangible assets for impairment using the relief from royalty\nmethod. This valuation approach requires that the Company make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value, including projections\nof future revenues, royalty rates, tax rates, discount rates, and other relevant variables. The projections in this model are updated annually\nand will change over time based on historical performance and changing business conditions. If the carrying value exceeded the\nestimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess amount.\nSubsequent Events\nOn April 15, 2024, Wilhelmina International, Inc. (the “Company”) engaged Mr. Gaurav Pahwa as the Company’s Chief\nFinancial Officer to serve as its “principal financial officer” and “principal accounting officer,” as those terms are defined under the\nrules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOn April 15, 2024, Mr. Jim McCarthy resigned from his position as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, effective as of\nsuch date.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot required for smaller reporting company\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information it is required to disclose in the\nreports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified\nin the SEC’s rules and forms. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons\nperforming similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have\nevaluated the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation,\nthe Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nDuring the most recent fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II\nOTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nOn October 24, 2013, a putative class action lawsuit was brought against the Company by former Wilhelmina model Alex\nShanklin and others, including Louisa Raske, Carina Vretman, Grecia Palomares and Michelle Griffin Trotter (the “Shanklin\nLitigation”), in New York State Supreme Court (New York County) by the same lead counsel who represented plaintiffs in a prior, now-\ndismissed action brought by Louisa Raske (the “Raske Litigation”). The claims in the Shanklin Litigation initially included breach of\ncontract and unjust enrichment allegations arising out of matters similar to the Raske Litigation, such as the handling and reporting of\nfunds on behalf of models and the use of model images. Other parties named as defendants in the Shanklin Litigation include other\nmodel management companies, advertising firms, and certain advertisers. On January 6, 2014, the Company moved to dismiss the\nAmended Complaint in the Shanklin Litigation for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and other grounds, and other\ndefendants also filed motions to dismiss. On August 11, 2014, the court denied the motion to dismiss as to Wilhelmina and other of the\nmodel management defendants. Separately, on March 3, 2014, the judge assigned to the Shanklin Litigation wrote the Office of the New\nYork Attorney General bringing the case to its attention, generally describing the claims asserted therein against the model management\ndefendants, and stating that the case “may involve matters in the public interest.” The judge’s letter also enclosed a copy of his decision\nin the Raske Litigation, which dismissed that case.\nPlaintiffs retained substitute counsel, who filed a Second and then Third Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs’ Third Amended\nComplaint asserts causes of action for alleged breaches of the plaintiffs' management contracts with the defendants, conversion, breach\nof the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. The Third Amended Complaint also alleges that the plaintiff models\nwere at all relevant times employees, and not independent contractors, of the model management defendants, and that defendants violated\nthe New York Labor Law in several respects, including, among other things, by allegedly failing to pay the models the minimum wages\nand overtime pay required thereunder, not maintaining accurate payroll records, and not providing plaintiffs with full explanations of\nhow their wages and deductions therefrom were computed. The Third Amended Complaint seeks certification of the action as a class\naction, damages in an amount to be determined at trial, plus interest, costs, attorneys’ fees, and such other relief as the court deems\nproper. On October 6, 2015, Wilhelmina filed a motion to dismiss as to most of the plaintiffs’ claims. The Court entered a decision\ngranting in part and denying in part Wilhelmina’s motion to dismiss on May 26, 2017. The Court (i) dismissed three of the five New\nYork Labor Law causes of action, along with the conversion, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment\ncauses of action, in their entirety, and (ii) permitted only the breach of contract causes of action, and some plaintiffs’ remaining two\nNew York Labor Law causes of action to continue, within a limited time frame. The plaintiffs and Wilhelmina each appealed, and the\ndecision was affirmed on May 24, 2018. On August 16, 2017, Wilhelmina timely filed its Answer to the Third Amended Complaint.\nOn June 6, 2016, another putative class action lawsuit was brought against the Company by former Wilhelmina model Shawn\nPressley and others, including Roberta Little (the “Pressley Litigation”), in New York State Supreme Court (New York County) by the\nsame counsel representing the plaintiffs in the Shanklin Litigation, and asserting identical, although more recent, claims as those in the\nShanklin Litigation. The Amended Complaint, asserting essentially the same types of claims as in the Shanklin action, was filed on\nAugust 16, 2017. Wilhelmina filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on September 29, 2017, which was granted in part and\ndenied in part on May 10, 2018. Some New York Labor Law and contract claims remain in the case. Pressley has withdrawn from the\ncase, leaving Roberta Little as the sole remaining named plaintiff in the Pressley Litigation. On July 12, 2019, the Company filed its\nAnswer and Counterclaim against Little.\nOn May 1, 2019, the Plaintiffs in the Shanklin Litigation (except Raske) and the Pressley Litigation filed motions for class\ncertification on their contract claims and the remaining New York Labor Law Claims. On July 12, 2019, Wilhelmina filed its opposition\nto the motions for class certification and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment against Shanklin, Vretman, Palomares, Trotter and\nLittle, and a motion for summary judgment against Raske.\nBy Order dated May 8, 2020 (the “Class Certification Order”), the Court denied class certification in the Pressley case, denied\nclass certification with respect to the breach of contract and alleged unpaid usage claims, granted class certification as to the New York\nLabor Law causes of action asserted by Vretman, Palomares and Trotter, and declined to rule on Wilhelmina’s motions for summary\njudgment, denying them without prejudice to be re-filed at a later date.\nThe Company believes the claims asserted in the Shanklin Litigation and Pressley Litigation are without merit and intends to\ncontinue to vigorously defend the actions. Nonetheless, an adverse outcome in either case is at least reasonably possible. However, the\nCompany is presently unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible loss in either case. Therefore, no amount has been\naccrued as of March 31, 2024 related to these matters.\nIn addition to the legal proceedings disclosed herein, the Company is also engaged in various legal proceedings that are routine\nin nature and incidental to its business. None of these routine proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, are believed likely, in\nthe Company's opinion, to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or its results of operations.\nItem 1.A. Risk Factors.\nNot required for smaller reporting company.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nDuring 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby the Company could repurchase up to\n500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. During 2013, the Board of Directors renewed and extended the Company’s share\nrepurchase authority to enable it to repurchase up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock. In 2016, the Board of Directors\nincreased by an additional 500,000 shares the number of shares of the Company’s common stock which may be repurchased under its\nstock repurchase program to an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or\nthrough privately negotiated transactions at prices the Company deems appropriate. The program does not obligate the Company to\nacquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion. The\nCompany did not make any purchases pursuant to the stock repurchase program during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024, no director or officer adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\nor non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6.
