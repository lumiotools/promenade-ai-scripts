Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.33 compared to $0.41 for the second quarter of 2024 and $0.51 for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company incurred a pre-tax loss of $6.9 million on the sale of investment securities due to the strategic repositioning of its balance sheet, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.16 for the quarter. The Company sold $78.0 million of investment securities with an estimated weighted average book yield of 1.88%. Proceeds were used to fund higher yielding loan growth for the quarter.\n\nJeff Deuel, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, \"We are very pleased with our operating results for the third quarter, which included strong loan and deposit growth, margin expansion, and continued benefits from expense management measures. The increases in average earning assets and net interest margin resulted in an improvement in net interest income of $1.8 million, or 3.6%, from the prior quarter. Although we experienced a charge-off during the quarter related to an owner-occupied commercial real estate loan previously downgraded to Substandard, we believe our overall credit quality remains very strong. We are optimistic that the combination of core balance sheet growth and prudent risk management will continue to benefit our core profitability.\"\n\n**_Financial Highlights_**\n\nThe following table provides financial highlights at the dates and for the periods indicated:\n\n**As of or for the Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,****2024** | **June 30,****2024** | **September 30,****2023**  \n**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**  \nNet income | $ 11,423 | $ 14,159 | $ 18,219  \nPre-tax, pre-provision income(1) | $ 15,505 | $ 17,263 | $ 20,919  \nDiluted earnings per share | $ 0.33 | $ 0.41 | $ 0.51  \nReturn on average assets(2) | 0.63 % | 0.80 % | 1.00 %  \nPre-tax, pre-provision return on average assets(1)(2) | 0.86 % | 0.98 % | 1.15 %  \nReturn on average common equity(2) | 5.30 % | 6.75 % | 8.80 %  \nReturn on average tangible common equity(1)(2) | 7.62 % | 9.74 % | 12.90 %  \nAdjusted return on average tangible common equity(1)(2) | 10.42 % | 10.74 % | 13.62 %  \nNet interest margin(2) | 3.33 % | 3.29 % | 3.47 %  \nCost of total deposits(2) | 1.42 % | 1.34 % | 0.83 %  \nEfficiency ratio | 71.7 % | 69.4 % | 66.2 %  \nAdjusted efficiency ratio(1) | 65.2 % | 67.1 % | 64.8 %  \nNoninterest expense to average total assets(2) | 2.18 % | 2.21 % | 2.25 %  \nTotal assets | $ 7,153,363 | $ 7,059,857 | $ 7,150,588  \nLoans receivable, net | $ 4,628,088 | $ 4,481,396 | $ 4,219,911  \nTotal deposits | $ 5,708,492 | $ 5,515,652 | $ 5,635,187  \nLoan to deposit ratio(3) | 82.0 % | 82.2 % | 75.7 %  \nBook value per share | $ 25.61 | $ 24.66 | $ 23.31  \nTangible book value per share(1) | $ 18.45 | $ 17.56 | $ 16.25  \n  \n(1) | Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

In addition, there were investment maturities and repayments of $43.3 million during the third quarter of 2024.

During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a $2.7 million provision for credit losses on loans, compared to a $1.5 million provision for credit losses on loans during the second quarter of 2024. The company recorded net charge-offs of $2.5 million during the quarter primarily from one owner-occupied CRE loan that was added to nonaccrual loans during the quarter. This loan was rated Substandard at the time of the charge-off and has been managed by our Special Assets Departments since December 2022.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a $266,000 reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments compared to a $202,000 reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments during the second quarter of 2024. The reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments during the third quarter of 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in the unfunded exposure on construction loans.\n\nThe following table provides detail on the changes in the ACL on loans and the ACL on unfunded commitments, and the related provision for (reversal of) credit losses for the periods indicated:\n\n**As of or for the Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023**  \n**ACL onLoans** | **ACL onUnfunded** | **Total** | **ACL onLoans** | **ACL onUnfunded** | **Total** | **ACL onLoans** | **ACL onUnfunded** | **Total**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nBalance, beginning ofperiod | $ 51,219 | $ 774 | $ 51,993 | $ 49,736 | $ 976 | $ 50,712 | $ 46,408 | $ 1,777 | $ 48,185  \nProvision for (reversal of)credit losses | 2,705 | (266) | 2,439 | 1,470 | (202) | 1,268 | (635) | (243) | (878)  \nNet recoveries (netcharge-offs) | (2,533) | — | (2,533) | 13 | — | — | 13 | 1,174 | — | 1,174  \nBalance, end of period | $ 51,391 | $ 508 | $ 51,899 | $ 51,219 | $ 774 | $ 51,993 | $ 46,947 | $ 1,534 | $ 48,481  \n  \n**_Credit Quality_**\n\nThe percentage of classified loans to loans receivable decreased to 1.5% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.8% at June 30, 2024. Classified loans include loans rated substandard or worse. The decrease was due primarily to payoffs and principal payments on substandard loans. Total loans designated as special mention increased by $5.4 million to $99.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $93.7 million at June 30, 2024.\n\nThe following table illustrates total loans by risk rating and their respective percentage of total loans at the dates indicated:\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**Balance** | **% ofTotal** | **Balance** | **% ofTotal**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nRisk Rating:  \nPass | $ 4,508,424 | 96.4 % | $ 4,356,425 | 96.1 %  \nSpecial Mention | 99,078 | 2.1 | 93,694 | 2.1  \nSubstandard | 71,977 | 1.5 | 82,496 | 1.8  \nTotal | $ 4,679,479 | 100.0 % | $ 4,532,615 | 100.0 %  \n  \nNonaccrual loans to loans receivable were 0.09% and 0.08% at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to the addition of one owner-occupied CRE loan moving to nonaccrual, a portion of which was charged-off during the quarter. This increase was partially offset by the payoff of two commercial and industrial loans. Changes in nonaccrual loans during the periods indicated were as follows:\n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,****2024** | **June 30,****2024** | **September 30,****2023**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nBalance, beginning of period | $ 3,826 | $ 4,792 | $ 4,630  \nAdditions | 4,990 | 549 | 440  \nNet principal payments and transfers to accruing status | (173) | (483) | (81)  \nPayoffs | (1,832) | (769) | (1,924)  \nCharge-offs | (2,510) | (263) | —  \nBalance, end of period | $ 4,301 | $ 3,826 | $ 3,065  \n  \n**_Liquidity_**\n\nTotal liquidity sources available at September 30, 2024 were $2.52 billion. This includes on- and off-balance sheet liquidity. The Company has access to Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") advances and the Federal Reserve Bank (\"FRB\") Discount Window. The Company's available liquidity sources at September 30, 2024 represented a coverage ratio of 44.2% of total deposits and 112.6% of estimated uninsured deposits.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's available liquidity:\n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,****2024** | **June 30,****2024**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nOn-balance sheet liquidity  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ 175,572 | $ 113,757  \nUnencumbered investment securities available for sale (1) | 848,224 | 926,822  \nTotal on-balance sheet liquidity | $ 1,023,796 | $ 1,040,579  \nOff-balance sheet liquidity  \nFRB borrowing availability | $ 287,739 | $ 278,632  \nFHLB borrowing availability (2) | 1,068,085 | 943,492  \nFed funds line borrowing availability with correspondent banks | 145,000 | 145,000  \nTotal off-balance sheet liquidity | $ 1,500,824 | $ 1,367,124  \nTotal available liquidity | $ 2,524,620 | $ 2,407,703  \n  \n(1) | Investment securities available for sale at fair value.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Includes FHLB total borrowing availability of $1.35 billion at September 30, 2024 based on pledged assets, however, maximum credit capacity is 45% of the Bank's total assets one quarter in arrears or $3.17 billion.  \n  \n**_Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin_**\n\nNet interest income increased $1.8 million, or 3.6%, during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, due primarily to a $3.2 million increase in interest income offset partially by a $1.4 million increase in interest expense. Net interest margin increased four basis points to 3.33% during the third quarter of 2024 from 3.29% during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe yield on interest earning assets increased 9 basis points to 5.02% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.93% for the second quarter of 2024. The yield on loans receivable, net, increased 8 basis points to 5.60% during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.52% during the second quarter of 2024 due primarily to higher rates on new and renewed loans.\n\nThe cost of interest bearing deposits increased 13 basis points to 2.02% for the third quarter of 2024 from 1.89% for the second quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in deposit rates during the quarter and an increase in certificate of deposit average balances of $68.5 million which carry higher rates than other interest bearing deposits.\n\nNet interest income decreased $2.7 million, or 4.8%, during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and the net interest margin decreased 14 basis points to 3.33% from 3.47% during this same period. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in interest expense resulting from increased deposit rates and borrowing expense, partially offset by an increase in yields earned on interest earning assets following increases in market interest rates.\n\nThe following table provides relevant net interest income information for the periods indicated:\n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023**  \n**Average** **Balance** | **Interest** **Earned/** **Paid** | **AverageYield/Rate(1)** | **Average** **Balance** | **Interest** **Earned/** **Paid** | **AverageYield/Rate(1)** | **Average** **Balance** | **Interest** **Earned/** **Paid** | **AverageYield/Rate(1)**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**Interest Earning Assets:**  \nLoans receivable, net (2)(3) | $ 4,555,090 | $ 64,138 | 5.60 % | $ 4,415,790 | $ 60,608 | 5.52 % | $ 4,201,554 | $ 56,119 | 5.30 %  \nTaxable securities | 1,604,529 | 13,472 | 3.34 | 1,685,795 | 14,156 | 3.38 | 1,931,649 | 14,590 | 3.00  \nNontaxable securities (3) | 17,482 | 159 | 3.62 | 18,812 | 165 | 3.53 | 60,654 | 448 | 2.93  \nInterest earning deposits | 150,384 | 2,048 | 5.42 | 121,539 | 1,653 | 5.47 | 169,186 | 2,310 | 5.42  \nTotal interest earning assets | 6,327,485 | 79,817 | 5.02 % | 6,241,936 | 76,582 | 4.93 % | 6,363,043 | 73,467 | 4.58 %  \nNoninterest earning assets | 855,436 | 864,855 | 849,689  \nTotal assets | $ 7,182,921 | $ 7,106,791 | $ 7,212,732  \n**Interest Bearing Liabilities:**  \nCertificates of deposit | $ 906,743 | $ 10,052 | 4.41 % | $ 838,285 | $ 9,128 | 4.38 % | $ 553,015 | $ 4,585 | 3.29 %  \nSavings accounts | 445,926 | 220 | 0.20 | 453,099 | 190 | 0.17 | 523,882 | 172 | 0.13  \nInterest bearing demand andmoney market accounts | 2,644,827 | 9,984 | 1.50 | 2,625,593 | 9,135 | 1.40 | 2,764,251 | 7,120 | 1.02  \nTotal interest bearing deposits | 3,997,496 | 20,256 | 2.02 | 3,916,977 | 18,453 | 1.89 | 3,841,148 | 11,877 | 1.23  \nJunior subordinated debentures | 21,946 | 541 | 9.81 | 21,874 | 539 | 9.91 | 21,649 | 540 | 9.90  \nSecurities sold under agreementto repurchase | — | — | — | — | — | — | 31,729 | 38 | 0.48  \nBorrowings | 452,364 | 6,062 | 5.33 | 500,230 | 6,477 | 5.21 | 451,032 | 5,394 | 4.74  \nTotal interest bearingliabilities | 4,471,806 | 26,859 | 2.39 % | 4,439,081 | 25,469 | 2.31 % | 4,345,558 | 17,849 | 1.63 %  \nNoninterest demand deposits | 1,677,984 | 1,638,262 | 1,859,374  \nOther noninterest bearingliabilities | 175,332 | 186,010 | 186,306  \nStockholders' equity | 857,799 | 843,438 | 821,494  \nTotal liabilities andstockholders' equity | $ 7,182,921 | $ 7,106,791 | $ 7,212,732  \nNet interest income and spread | $ 52,958 | 2.63 % | $ 51,113 | 2.62 % | $ 55,618 | 2.95 %  \nNet interest margin | 3.33 % | 3.29 % | 3.47 %  \n  \n(1) | Annualized; average balances are calculated using daily balances.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Average loans receivable, net includes loans held for sale and loans classified as nonaccrual, which carry a zero yield.

The decrease was due primarily to the increase in loss resulting from the above-referenced sale of investment securities recognized in the third quarter of 2024 as part of the strategic repositioning of the balance sheet, compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in gain on sale of other assets, net which was due to the $1.5 million gain on sale of an administrative building recognized during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNoninterest income decreased $4.4 million from the same period in 2023 due primarily to a $6.9 million pre-tax loss on the sale of investment securities during the third quarter of 2024, offset partially by the gain on sale of other assets, net as discussed previously.\n\nThe following table presents the key components of noninterest income and the change for the periods indicated:\n\n**Quarter Ended** | **Quarter OverQuarter Change** | **Prior Year** **Quarter Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**September 30,****2024** | **June 30,****2024** | **September 30,****2023** | **$** | **%** | **$** | **%**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nService charges and other fees | $ 2,788 | $ 2,817 | $ 2,856 | $ (29) | (1.0) % | $ (68) | (2.4) %  \nCard revenue | 2,134 | 1,930 | 2,273 | 204 | 10.6 | (139) | (6.1)  \nLoss on sale of investment securities | (6,945) | (1,921) | (1,940) | (5,024) | 261.5 | (5,005) | 258.0  \nGain on sale of loans, net | — | — | 157 | — | — | (157) | (100.0)  \nInterest rate swap fees | — | 52 | 62 | (52) | (100.0) | (62) | (100.0)  \nBank owned life insurance income | 860 | 931 | 734 | (71) | (7.6) | 126 | 17.2  \nGain on sale of other assets, net | 1,480 | 49 | — | 1,431 | 2,920.4 | 1,480 | 100.0  \nOther income | 1,520 | 1,388 | 2,129 | 132 | 9.5 | (609) | (28.6)  \nTotal noninterest income | $ 1,837 | $ 5,246 | $ 6,271 | $ (3,409) | (65.0) % | $ (4,434) | (70.7) %  \n  \n**_Noninterest Expense_**\n\nNoninterest expense increased $0.2 million, or 0.5%, during the third quarter of 2024 from the second quarter of 2024. Data processing expense increased during the quarter due primarily to timing of expenses and annual rate increases; however, data processing expense continued to be lower than the same period in 2023. Professional services expense decreased compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to timing of services performed.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 4.1%, during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Compensation and employee benefits expense decreased due to a reduction in full-time equivalent employees to 749 at September 30, 2024 from 821 at September 30, 2023. Data processing expense decreased primarily due to a decline in ongoing costs resulting from prior technology-related contract renewals and terminations. Marketing expense decreased due to expense management efforts to reduce spending. Other expense decreased due to a decrease in customer account loss expense and a reduction in employee related expense.\n\nThe following table presents the key components of noninterest expense and the change for the periods indicated:\n\n**Quarter Ended** | **Quarter OverQuarter Change** | **Prior YearQuarter Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**September 30,****2024** | **June 30,****2024** | **September 30,****2023** | **$** | **%** | **$** | **%**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nCompensation and employeebenefits | $ 24,367 | $ 24,448 | $ 25,008 | $ (81) | (0.3) % | $ (641) | (2.6) %  \nOccupancy and equipment | 4,850 | 4,765 | 4,814 | 85 | 1.8 | 36 | 0.7  \nData processing | 3,915 | 3,535 | 4,116 | 380 | 10.7 | (201) | (4.9)  \nMarketing | 128 | 244 | 389 | (116) | (47.5) | (261) | (67.1)  \nProfessional services | 490 | 795 | 582 | (305) | (38.4) | (92) | (15.8)  \nState/municipal business and usetaxes | 1,249 | 1,160 | 1,088 | 89 | 7.7 | 161 | 14.8  \nFederal deposit insurance premium | 824 | 812 | 818 | 12 | 1.5 | 6 | 0.7  \nAmortization of intangible assets | 399 | 421 | 595 | (22) | (5.2) | (196) | (32.9)  \nOther expense | 3,068 | 2,916 | 3,560 | 152 | 5.2 | (492) | (13.8)  \nTotal noninterest expense | $ 39,290 | $ 39,096 | $ 40,970 | $ 194 | 0.5 % | $ (1,680) | (4.1) %  \n  \n**_Income Tax Expense_**\n\nIncome tax expense decreased $193,000 during the third quarter of 2024 to $1.6 million compared to $1.8 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in income tax expense during the current quarter compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nIncome tax expense decreased during the third quarter of 2024 compared to same period in 2023 due to lower pre-tax income during the third quarter of 2024. The effective tax rate declined due to lower pre-tax income which increased the impact of favorable permanent tax items such as tax-exempt investments, investments in bank owned life insurance and tax credits.\n\nThe following table presents the income tax expense and related metrics and the change for the periods indicated:\n\n**Quarter Ended** | **Change**  \n---|---  \n**September30,****2024** | **June 30,****2024** | **September30,****2023** | **Quarter OverQuarter** | **Prior YearQuarter**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nIncome before income taxes | $ 13,066 | $ 15,995 | $ 21,797 | $ (2,929) | $ (8,731)  \nIncome tax expense | $ 1,643 | $ 1,836 | $ 3,578 | $ (193) | $ (1,935)  \nEffective income tax rate | 12.6 % | 11.5 % | 16.4 % | 1.1 % | (3.8) %  \n  \n**_Dividends_**\n\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share.

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: potential adverse impacts to economic conditions nationally or in our local market areas, other markets where we have lending relationships, or other aspects of our business operations or financial markets including, without limitation, as a result of credit quality deterioration, pronounced and sustained reductions in real estate market values, employment levels, labor shortages and the effects of inflation, a potential recession or slowed economic growth; changes in the interest rate environment which could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; the level and impact of inflation and the current and future monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in response thereto; the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative publicity about the banking industry in general on investor and depositor sentiment regarding the stability and liquidity of banks; legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business, including changes in banking, securities, and tax law, regulatory policies and principles, or the interpretation of regulatory capital or other rules, including as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election; credit and interest rate risks associated with our business, customers, borrowings, repayment, investment, and deposit practices; fluctuations in deposits and deposit concentrations; liquidity issues, including our ability to borrow funds or raise additional capital, if necessary; fluctuations in the value of our investment securities; credit risks and risks from concentrations (by type of geographic area and industry) within our loan portfolio; disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions for our business, including as a result of sophisticated attacks using artificial intelligence and similar tools; rapid technological change in the financial services industry; increased competition in the financial services industry from non-banks such as credit unions and Fintech companies, including digital asset service providers; our ability to adapt successfully to technological changes to compete effectively in the marketplace, including as a result of competition from other commercial banks, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, and financial technology companies; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments, including the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; the commencement and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and regulatory actions against us or to which we may become subject; the effects of climate change, severe weather events, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other public health crises, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events on our business and the businesses of our clients; our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items; and other factors described in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") which are available on our website at [www.heritagebanknw.com](http://www.heritagebanknw.com) and on the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Moreover, any of the forward-looking statements that we make in this press release or the documents we file with or furnish to the SEC are based only on information then actually known to us and upon management's beliefs and assumptions at the time they are made which may turn out to be wrong because of inaccurate assumptions we might make, because of the factors described above or because of other factors that we cannot foresee.

Open issues require assurance once remediation is reported by management. Once the risk is\neffffectively controlled, the Bank’s Inffformation and Cybersecurity Risk Assessment is updated. The Inffformation and\nCybersecurity risk management program is an ongoing program that reflects the current state of the industry and\ncurrentbestpracticeatalltimes.\nCybersecurityGovernancePrinciples\nThe Bank relies on the implementation of comprehensive policies and standards that align to the National Institute\nof Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") Cybersecurity Framework, regulatory and interagency guidelines and\nrequirements, to ensure cybersecurity risks are reduced in the day to day operations of the Bank’s technology and\noperational platforms and serrrvices.

We have closed 36 branches over the past 13 years. We use green janitorial\nproducts and LED bulbs that have a longer life and use less energy, and we repurpose existing furniture whenever\npossible. We continually find ways to implement technology platforms which provide efffficiencies and a paperless\nenvironment.Wealsorecycleacrossourfootprint.\nSustainablePractices\nWe are fffocused on sustainability throughout our everyday business practices, which includes a management-led\nGreen Team Committee fffocused on sustainability. The Committee led the EcoChallenge which included 28 teams\nthroughout the Bank who engaged in friendly competition by completing environmentally sustainable actions and\npractices. Challenges typically involve perrrforming sustainable behaviors, such as reducing waste, conserrrving\nenergy, or adopting eco-friendly lifestyle habits.The collective efffforts of the EcoChallenge resulted in 9,673 actions,\nwhich contribute to a broader awareness of environmental responsibility and promotes a sense of community\nengagement and shared commitment. Heritage has invested in solar tax credits for a solar photovoltaic project with\nthe capacity of three megawatts that produces clean energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and creates jobs.\nAs a result, we are receiving renewable tax credits with solar production estimated at over 82 million kilowatts over\nfifteenyears.HeritagealsoparticipatesineCyclingoldtechnologyequipmenttoavoidsendingittolandfills.\nLendingPractices\nAt Heritage, we have limited exposure to environmentally unfriendly industries and engage in prudent practices to\nreduce environmental hazards in a variety of ways.

Under the\nguidelines for non-employee directors, each director is expected to have equity ownership with a value of not less\nthan three times his or her annual cash retainer. The guidelines require directors to retain not less than 50% of\nshares received (on a net afffter tax basis) until the director satisfies the ownership requirements. If the director fails\nto satisfffy the ownership requirement, 25% of their annual cash director fees will instead be paid in Heritage shares.\nThe guidelines provide the directors with three years to reach the required ownership level. As of December 31,\n2023, all directors were in compliance with the guidelines. Inffformation about ownership guidelines for our named\nexecutiveofficerscanbefoundinthe“CompensationDiscussionandAnalysis”sectionofthisProxyStatement.\nPROPOSAL 2—ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), we\nare required to periodically include in our annual meeting proxy statements and present at the annual meeting of\nshareholders a non-binding proposal to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. This proposal,\ncommonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the\ncompensation of Heritage’s named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. We currently hold our\nsay-on-pay vote every year. The proposal will be presented at the annual meeting in the form of the fffollowing\nresolution:\nRESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of Heritage Financial Corporation’s\nnamed executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the\ncompensationtablesandrelatedmaterialinHeritage’sProxyStatementforthe2024annualmeetingof\nshareholders.\nThis vote will not be binding on our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee and will not be construed as\noverruling a decision by the Board or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty of the Board. The Compensation\nCommittee and the Board will consider the outcome of the vote when determining future executive compensation\narrangements.\nThe purpose of our compensation policies and procedures is to attract and retain experienced, highly qualified\nexecutives critical to our long-term success and enhancement of shareholder value. We believe that our\ncompensation policies and procedures are strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. As\ndiscussed in the Compensation Discussion andAnalysis, the Compensation Committee believes that the executive\ncompensation fffor 2023 is reasonable and appropriate, is justified by Heritage’s perrrformance and is the result of a\ncarefullyconsideredapproach.\nThe Committee regularly reviews our offfficer compensation strategies, policies and programs in an effffort to ensure\nthe program continues to meet its objectives. In considering how to vote on this proposal, the Board requests that\nyouconsiderthefffollowingfactors:\n• Pay for Performance—A significant portion of our named executive officers’ compensation is tied to\nperrrformancewithclearlyarticulatedfinancialgoals.\n• AnnualCompensationRiskAssessment—Wehaveanestablishedprocessinplacewherebyweregularly\nanalyzerisksrelatedtoourcompensationprograms,andweannuallyconductabroadriskassessment.\n• Key Performance Metrics—Objective perrrformance metrics are established to determine annual incentive\ncompensation.\n25\n• Clawback Policy—Our policy requires recovery of certain perrrformance-based cash and equity incentive\ncompensationintheeventofafinancialrestatement.\n• Performance-vesting Equity Grants—50% of our named executive officer equity grants vest based on the\nattainmentofobjectiveperffformancemetricsrelativetoapre-determinedpeergroup.\n• Stock Ownership Policy—Directors and offfficers are required to own Heritage common stock having a\nvalue of at least the fffollowing amounts: 3 times the annual cash retainer for our non-employee directors, 3\ntimes the annual base salary for our CEO and 1.5 times the annual base salary fffor our remaining named\nexecutiveofficers.\n• Independent Compensation Consultant—The Compensation Committee retains an independent\nconsultanttoobtainadviceonexecutivecompensationmatters.\nEachoftheabovefactorsisdiscussedmorefullyintheCompensationDiscussionandAnalysisbelow.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named\nexecutiveofffficersasdisclosedinthisProxyStatement.\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we discuss our executive compensation philosophy and programs.

During the first quarter of 2023, the banking industry experienced significant challenges resulting in a\nseries of bank failures. Heritage was not immune to decreased deposits with higher cost of deposits due to\ncustomers seeking higher interest rates and moving balances to higher yielding investments.At Heritage, we grew\ntotal assets and loans, and restructured the balance sheet by reinvesting in higher yielding investments.As a result\nof the balance sheet restructure, the 2023 pre-tax net income was reduced by a $12.2 million loss on sale of\nsecurities. Heritage managed noninterest expenses by reducing full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, closing the\nmortgage business line and revisiting the organization's staffing structure.Additionally, management renegotiated a\ncore systems contract which will reduce costs in future years.

Management, the Board, and the\nCommittee pay careful attention to communications received from shareholders regarding executive compensation,\nincluding the results of these non-binding advisory votes. The Committee considered the results of the non-binding\nadvisory vote as one of many factors in making 2023 compensation decisions and will continue to do so as we\nreview our compensation program and practices to ensure they continue to support our business strategy and align\nwith shareholders' interests. The Committee believes that these votes reflect our shareholders’ affffirmation of our\n27\ncompensation philosophy and the manner in which we compensate our executives. We value our shareholders’\nfeedback and, as a result, entered into our tenth annual shareholder outreach program during 2023.

The philosophy is to target total executive compensation at market competitive levels to manage\nbase salary levels, allow for meaningful perffformance-based compensation and recruit and retain key talent. Our\ncompensation philosophy considers factors, such as internal pay equity and the experience, tenure and scope of\nresponsibility of each of our NEOs. Officer compensation is weighted in favor of Heritage’s achievement of stated\nannualandlong-termperrrformanceobjectives.\nOur compensation programs are designed to link a meaningful portion of compensation with perrrformance, taking\ninto account competitive compensation levels at peer group institutions and in the markets where we compete fffor\ntalent.Thepoliciesandunderlyingphilosophygoverningourcompensationprogramsincludethefffollowing:\n• Employer of Choice—We view compensation as a key factor to being an employer of choice in our\nmarkets. We believe that competitive compensation and benefits allow us to attract and retain well-qualified,\nkeyemployeeswhoarecriticaltoourlong-termsuccess.\n• Pay Aligned with Performance—We strive to provide a competitive salary combined with incentive\nopportunities that reward outstanding individual and Company perrrformance that contributes to creating\nshareholdervalue.\n• Prudent Management of Risk—We evaluate, design and manage compensation programs to ensure that\nwe are properly and prudently assessing and managing any risks created by these programs. The\nCommittee has the authority and responsibility to mitigate such risks, where necessary, through procedural\noversightorprogrammodification.\n• Flexibility—Werecognizethatthemarketffforkeytalentrequiresflexibilityincompensationdesigninorderto\nattract qualified individuals. Salary ranges and individual compensation decisions take into account local\ncompetitive pressures and changing market conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions. Furthermore, the\ntargeted position relative to market may vary depending on the type and level of position, recognizing the\ndifferentrecruitingconditionsandrelativeimportanceofvariousqualifications.\nThis compensation philosophy is reviewed periodically by the Committee and is modified, as appropriate, to reflect\nmarkettrendsandindustrybestpractices.\nRole of the Compensation Committee\nThe Committee, composed entirely of independent directors, establishes and monitors compensation programs fffor\nemployeesofHeritageanditssubsidiaries.TheCommittee’sresponsibilitiesareto:\n• reviewthegoals,policiesandobjectivesofthecompensationplansofHeritageandHeritageBank;\n• review and administer our compensation plans in light of the goals and objectives of these plans, and adopt\nandrecommendnewcompensationplansoramendmentstoexistingplans,asnecessaryoradvisable;\n29\n• review and approve actions affffecting salaries, annual cash incentives, benefits, equity compensation grants\nandothercompensationarrangementsfffortheNEOs;\n• reviewandapprovethecorporategoalsandobjectivesfffortheNEOsannually;\n• review and recommend to the Board for approval any changes to director compensation, including fees,\nbenefitsandequitycompensationgrants;\n• review the results of all shareholder advisory votes regarding executive compensation and consider whether\ntoimplementanychangesasaresultoftheadvisoryvotes;\n• review and evaluate risks posed to Heritage by the design and administration of various compensation\nprograms and ensure appropriate risk management and controls to avoid or mitigate any excessive or\nunreasonablerisktoHeritage;\n• approve and recommend to the Board fffor adoption any programs or policies regarding the recovery of\npreviously paid or earned compensation later determined to have been based on inaccurate financial\ninformation;\n• reviewanddiscusstheCompensationDiscussionandAnalysiswithmanagement;and\n• review our policies regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to executive offfficers for purposes of\nSection162(m)oftheInternalRevenueCode.\nIn order to fulfill these responsibilities, the Committee’s charter provides it the authority and adequate funding to\nretain and terminate any third-party advisors for the purpose of evaluating the compensation programs fffor, and\nperffformanceof,Heritage’sdirectors,CEOandotherseniorexecutiveofficers.\nRole of Management in Compensation Committee Deliberations\nThe Committee frequently requests that the CEO and other members of senior management be present at\nCommitteemeetingstodiscussexecutivecompensation.Executiveofficersinattendancemayprovidetheirinsights\nand suggestions, but only Committee members may vote on decisions regarding the NEOs' compensation. The\nCommittee may discuss the CEO's compensation with him, but final deliberations and all votes regarding NEO\ncompensation are made in executive sessions with independent directors and without the CEO and other members\nof management present. The Committee also reviews input from the independent compensation consultant and/or\nlegalcounselwhenmakingdecisionsregardingthecompensationoftheCEOandtheotherNEOs.\nCompensation Consultants and Advisors\ne Committee utilizes the serrrvices of Pearl Meyer & Partners (“Pearl Meyer”), an independent compensation\nconsulting firm. Pearl Meyer provides assistance and advice related to a variety of Committee responsibilities on an\nas-needed basis, such as review of incentive plans, review of compensation philosophy and strategy, evaluation of\ncompensation-related proposals from management, and ongoing Committee education on compensation topics.\nPearl Meyer does not perrrform any services for the Company other than those directed by the Committee.After the\nCommittee’s review of applicable rules for independence, the Committee determined that Pearl Meyer is\nindependent.PearlMeyerreportsdirectlytotheCommittee.\nThe Committee has the authority to retain, at Heritage’s expense, legal counsel and other advisors, on an as-\nneeded basis, and has and will evaluate the independence of such advisors as the Committee deems appropriate\nandasmayberequiredbytheNasdaqlistingstandards.\nUse of Competitive Data\nThe Committee reviews its peer group every two years and engaged Pearl Meyer in 2023 to update the peer group\ncompaniesandcompetitivecompensationstudy.TheCommitteeusedtheresultsinmakingpaydecisionsfor2023.\n30\nDuring2023,theCommitteeapprovedapeergroupbased,generally,onthefollowingcriteria:\n• commercialbankslocatedintheU.S.andpublicly-tradedfinancialinstitutions;\n• assetsizerangeof0.5to2.0timesHeritage;\n• operatingrevenueof0.5to2.0timesHeritage;\n• marketcapitalizationrangeof0.5to2.0timesHeritage;\n• considerbanksthroughouttheU.S.butgiveprioritytoWesternU.S.banks;and\n• comparablebusinessmodel.\nTheresultingbenchmarkingpeergroupconsistedofthefffollowing20companies:\nPeerBanks\nAmerantBancorpInc.

The\ncomposition of the perrrformance peer group is established by the Committee at the beginning of each perrrformance\ncycle and generally consists of all U.S. commercial banks (or their holding companies) traded on a major exchange\nwithtotalassetsatthebeginningoftheperrrformanceperiodbetweenone-halfandtwicethetotalassetsofHeritage.\nThe Committee uses a different, larger peer group fffor the perrrformance-based equity grants to our NEOs to mitigate\nthe impact of one or more companies exiting the peer group due to acquisitions or mergers during the three-year\nperffformance period.

The graphs below represent the target pay mixes\nresulting from the compensation components provided by Heritage in 2023 pursuant to the NEO employment\nagreements. Mr. Deuel, our CEO, and other NEOs have significant variable pay at risk, with their annual incentive\nbonus, 50% of their target equity award and their deferred compensation opportunity subject to pre-established\nperffformance goals.

The objectives of the MIP are to reward\nandretainhighperrrformers,todriveHeritage’slong-termfinancialsuccess,toencourageteamworkandtocreatean\nenvironment where executives are rewarded if Heritage achieves or exceeds pre-determined annual perrrformance\ncriteria. The MIP’s design incorporates annual incentive awards that are linked to the achievement of pre-defined\nperffformance goals with targets and maximum percentages determined by roles and responsibilities. The incentive\nranges (as a percentage of salary) are designed to provide market competitive payouts fffor the achievement of\nthreshold, target and maximum levels of perrrformance. The annual awards are determined by previously approved\ngoals, calculated based on actual financial and individual perrrformance results and then recommended by\nmanagement to the Committee. The Committee then reviews and approves or disapproves the annual cash\nincentiverecommendations.\nThe Committee approves the funding for the MIP based on meeting or exceeding corporate perrrformance goals.\nEach perrrformance goal has an established threshold (minimum), target and maximum expected perrrformance level.\nNo payment will be made fffor a goal if perrrformance falls below the threshold level. Perrrformance ratings for each\nspecific corporate and individual goal between threshold and target or between target and maximum will result in a\nproration of the annual cash incentive payout. Each NEO has a scorecard with perrrformance results. The 2023 MIP\nprovided that no bonus payments would be paid from the plan should the corporate Tier 1 Leverage Ratio drop\nbelow 8% as of December 31, 2023. The Committee reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to adjust incentive\npayouts when extraordinary circumstances occur during the perrrformance period.

Each NEO's target opportunity is based upon factors such as the executive's role and scope of\nresponsibilities. If an NEO did not meet the perrrformance goals under the MIPfor the prior year, the offfficer may also\nreceive a reduced equity award or no award. Additionally, each NEO is required to maintain a satisfactory\nperffformance rating to receive an equity award.

If an NEO fails to satisfffy the ownership requirement, 25% of the NEOs' annual cash incentive bonus\nwill instead be paid in Heritage shares. The guidelines provide the NEOs with five years to reach the required\nownership level. As of December 31, 2023, all NEOs were in compliance with the guidelines. Inffformation about\nownership guidelines for our non-employee directors can be fffound in the “Director Compensation” section of this\nProxyStatement.\nRetirement Benefits\n401(k) Plan: We maintain the Heritage Financial Corporation 401(k) Plan Profit Sharing Plan and Trust as a tax-\nqualified retirement plan. The Plan is a defined contribution plan and is designed to provide employees (including\nNEOs) with savings opportunities and financial security during retirement. There are currently two possible\nCompanycontributionstothePlan:\n• Amatching contribution equal to 50% of an employee’s salary deferral contributions up to a maximum of 6%\nof an employee’s eligible compensation (i.e., a maximum matching contribution equal to 3% of the\nemployee'seligiblecompensation);and\n• A profit-sharing contribution that includes a discretionary contribution, based on a percentage of an\nemployee’s eligible compensation, Heritage’s financial perrrformance and management’s recommendation, as\nmay be approved by the Board. For 2023, the Company did not make a discretionary contribution to the\nPlan.\nDeferred Compensation Plan: Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants are permitted to elect to defer\ncompensation, and Heritage has the discretion to make additional contributions to the plan on behalf of any\nparticipant based on a number of factors. The notional account balances earn interest on an annual basis and the\nCommittee may change this crediting rate prospectively, at its discretion. The current applicable crediting rate, as\ninitially selected by the Committee, is the Moody’s Seasoned Aaa Corporate Bond Yield as of January 1 of each\nyear. Generally, a participant’s account is payable upon the earliest of the participant’s separation from serrrvice with\nHeritage,theparticipant’sdeathordisability,oraspecifieddatethatiselectedbytheparticipantinaccordancewith\napplicable rules of the Internal Revenue Code. Heritage’s obligation to make payments under the Deferred\nCompensation Plan is a general obligation of the Company and is to be paid from Heritage’s general assets. As\nsuch, participants are general unsecured creditors of Heritage with respect to their participation in the Plan. The\nCommittee believes that the Deferred Compensation Plan provides Heritage with another tool to attract and retain\nthebestqualifiedindividualstoserrrveinkeyroleswithintheorganization.\nEach of the NEOs except fffor Mr. Ray has entered into a participation agreement pursuant to which Heritage will\nmake perrrformance-based contributions to accounts maintained on the NEO's behalf under the Deferred\nCompensation Plan.The terms of the particular participation agreements fffor the NEOs are described in more detail\nfollowingtheNonqualifiedDeferredCompensationtablebelow.\nTheCommitteeapprovedthefffollowingperrrformancegoalsffforthe2022perrrformanceperiod:\nActual2022\nCorporateGoal Weighting Threshold Target Maximum Performance\nDilutedEarningsperShare 50% $1.46 $1.62 $1.83 2.31(1)\nNetChargeOffffs/AAAverageLoans 50% 0.16% 0.08% 0.03% (0.03)%\nContributionOpportunityas%ofSalary 10% 20% 35% 175%(2)\n(1) TheDilutedEarningsperShareutilizedfortheDeferredCompensationPlancontributionsmadein2023was$2.37duetoanadjustment\nfortheimpactsofacquiredtalentintheOregonmarket.\n(2) Payoutasapercentageoftargetpayout.\n36\nThefffollowingtablereflectsthe2023deferredcompensationcontributionsbasedon2022perrrformanceresults:\nEarnedDeferred\nEarnedDeferred CompensationIncentive\nCompensation asPercentageofTotal\nName Incentives($) Compensation(%)\nffreyJ.Deuel $231,525 17.8%\nBryanD.McDonald $147,128 19.2%\nDonaldJ.Hinson $126,133 19.6%\nTonyW.Chalfant $108,838 19.8%\nMatthewT.Ray $— —%\nTheCommitteeapprovedthefffollowingperrrformancegoalsffforthe2023perrrformanceperiod:\nActual2023\nCorporateGoal Weighting Threshold Target Maximum Performance\ntedEarningsperShare 50% $2.42 $2.69 $3.09 $1.75\nNetChargeOffffs/AAAverageLoans 50% 0.12% 0.07% 0.02% (0.01)%\nContributionOpportunityas%ofSalary 10% 20% 35% 87.5%(1)\n(1) Payoutasapercentageoftargetpayout.\nIn February 2024, the Committee approved Company contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan of\n$124,445, $79,081, $69,373, and $58,501 on behalf of Messrs.

In addition, the policies permit the NEOs to\naccess an accelerated eligible death benefit in an amount equal to the lesser of 100% of the net amount-at-risk or\n$500,000 in the event the NEO incurs a chronic or terminal illness during employment, fffollowing termination of\nemployment, on or after the NEO's attainment of age 62, or when the NEO is involuntarily terminated or terminates\nemployment for good reason fffollowing a change in control.

These regulations do not set specific parameters within which\ncompensation decisions must be made; however, they do require that the Company and the Committee be mindful\nof the risks associated with compensation programs designed to incentivize superior perrrformance. While the\nregulatory fffocus has been heightened over the last several years, the incorporation of general risk assessment\nconceptsintocompensationdecisionsisnotarecentdevelopment.\n37\nUnder the Interagenccy Guideliiines EEEstttablllishiiing Stttandarrrds for Safffetty and Soundness (the \"Safety and Soundness\nStandards\"), published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") in 2015, excessive compensation is\nprohibited as an unsafe and unsound practice. When determining whether compensation is excessive, the FDIC\nhasdirectedfinancialinstitutionstoconsiderwhetheraggregatecashamountspaidornoncashbenefitsprovidedto\nan employee is unreasonable or disproportionate to the services the employee perrrforms. The Safety and\nSoundness Standards set forth a framework within which financial institutions should evaluate an employee’s\ncompensation, with factors including compensation history, internal pay equity, and, if appropriate, comparable\ncompensation practices at peer institutions. This framework also requires Heritage to consider its overall financial\ncondition.\nSeparately, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thriffft\nSuperrrvision together issued the Guidance on Sound Incentttivvve Compensatttion Polllicies (the \"Joint Guidance\") in\n2010. The Joint Guidance complements the Safety and Soundness Standards and establishes a framework within\nwhich financial institutions must assess the soundness of their incentive compensation plans, programs, and\narrangements. Because the Joint Guidance is limited to senior executive officers and those other individuals who,\neither alone or as a group, could pose a material risk to the financial institution, it is somewhat narrower in scope\nthan the Safety and Soundness Standards. With respect to those individuals to whom it applies, the Joint Guidance\naims to ensure that any available incentive compensation arrangements appropriately balance risk and reward, are\ncompatiblewitheffffectivecontrolsandriskmanagement,andhavethesupportofstrongcorporategovernance.\nThe Company is also subject to the SEC’s rules regarding risk assessment, which apply to all publicly-traded\ncompanies. The SEC rules require Heritage to determine whether any of its existing incentive compensation plans,\nprograms, or arrangements create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effffect on the\nCompany.Accordingly, the Committee completes an annual risk assessment of all of the Company’s compensation\nprograms and components, most recently perrrformed in December 2023. The Committee has determined that the\nCompany's incentive compensation plans, programs, and arrangements do not create risks that are reasonably\nlikelytohaveamaterialadverseeffffectontheCompany.\nThe Committee believes that its regular, overall assessment of the compensation plans, programs and\narrangements established for the Company's NEOs includes a sensible, responsible approach toward balancing\nrisks and rewarding reasonable, but not easily attainable, goals. The Committee annually revisits the frameworks\nset ffforth in the Safety and Soundness Standards and the Joint Guidance, as both are effffective parts of the\nCommittee's overall assessment of the balance between risk and reward in the Company’s compensation\narrangements.\nFinally, when making decisions about executive compensation, the Company also considers the impact of other\nregulatory provisions, including: Section 162(m) of the Code regarding the tax deductibility of certain compensation;\nSection 409A of the Code regarding nonqualified deferred compensation; Section 280G of the Code regarding\nexcise taxes and deduction limitations on golden parachute payments made in connection with a change in control;\nand FASBASC Topic 718, which requires Heritage to recognize the compensation cost of grants of equity awards\nbasedupontheirgrantdatefairvalue.\nClawback Policy\nOn November 7, 2023, we adopted an enhanced clawback policy which was effective October 2, 2023, in\naccordance with the latest SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards, a copy of which is publicly filed with ourAnnual\nReport on Form 10-K. The new policy replaces and supersedes the prior clawback policy that we adopted in\nDecember2014.\nAnti-Hedging and Pledging Policy\nHeritage's insider trading policy specifically prohibits our insiders from entering into hedging transactions involving\nthe Company's stock. To our knowledge, none of our executive officers or directors has entered into a hedging\ntransaction involving Company stock in violation of this prohibition. The insider trading policy also identifies the risk\nof pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan or a margin account and cautions against such as it carries\nwith it the risk of insider trading liability if the loan defaults or the if the insider fails to meet the margin call. To our\nknowledge,noneofourNEOsordirectorshaspledgedtheirCompanystock.\n38\nTax and Accounting Considerations\nHeritageconsiderstaxandaccountingimplicationsinthedesignofitscompensationprograms.Forexample,inthe\nselection of long-term incentive instruments, the Committee reviews the projected expense amounts and expense\ntiming associated with alternative types of awards. In selecting appropriate incentive devices, the Committee\nreviewsextensivefinancialscenariosandanalysesandconsiderstherelatedtaxandaccountingissues.\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, generally precludes a tax deduction for compensation\nin excess of $1 million paid by a public company to any individual covered by the recently expanded definition of a\n\"coveredemployee\"inataxableyear.TheCommitteeconsidersthislimitwhenmakingcompensationdecisions,but\nit retains the discretion to pay non-deductible compensation if it believes doing so would be in Heritage's best\ninterests.\nREPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Heritage Financial Corporation has submitted the\nfollowingreportffforinclusioninthisProxyStatement:\nTheCompensationCommitteehasreviewedandapprovedtheCompensationDiscussionandAnalysiscontainedin\nthis Proxy Statement with management.

Retention of\nthe current leadership team is a critical goal of the Board as it protects Heritage and its shareholders and provides\nstability and the type of skilled leadership needed in the current operating environment. Employment agreements\nalso provide critical protection to Heritage by subjecting the executives to non-competition, non-solicitation and\notherrestrictionsfollowingtheiremployment.\nHeritage entered into new employment agreements with Messrs. Deuel, Hinson, and McDonald effective as of July\n1, 2019, Mr. Chalfant effffective July 1, 2020, and Mr. Ray effffective January 1, 2023. Except as noted below, the\nmaterial terms of the agreements are identical. The agreements have an initial term through June 30, 2022 (June\n30, 2023 fffor Mr. Chalfant and Mr. Ray), which automatically extends for an additional year on July 1, 2020 (July 1,\n2021 for Mr. Chalfant and July 1, 2023 for Mr. Ray) and each July 1 thereafffter, unless either party gives at least 90\ndays’priornoticethattheemploymentperiodwillnotbeextended.\nThe employment agreements provide fffor annual base salaries as fffollows: fffor Mr. Deuel, $711,113; for Mr.\nMcDonald, $451,892, for Mr. Hinson, $396,420, for Mr. Chalfant, $334,289, and for Mr. Ray, $301,515, as adjusted\nforsalaryincreasesin2023.Thesalarieswillbereviewedannuallyandmaybeincreased,butnotdecreased,atthe\ndiscretion of the Heritage Board. The agreements provide that each executive is eligible to receive a perrrformance-\nbased annual cash incentive bonus, in accordance with Heritage’s annual incentive plan, with the target\nopportunities stated as the following percentages of the applicable annual base salary: for Mr. Deuel, 50%, fffor Mr.\nMcDonald, 45%, fffor Messrs. Hinson and Chalfant 40%, and for Mr. Ray 35%. In addition, each NEO is entitled to\nparticipate in any other incentive or employee benefit plans of Heritage, on as favorable a basis as other similarly\nsituated and perrrforming senior executives. The agreements with Messrs. Deuel and McDonald, provide each\nexecutiveanautomobileforbusinessuseoracarallowance.\nThe agreements provide for severance benefits in the event the executive’s employment is terminated by Heritage\nother than fffor cause and other than as a result of the executive’s death or disability, or if the employment is\nterminated by the executive for good reason (“TTTermination”). For a Termination during the term of the employment\nagreementthatisnotinconnectionwithachangeincontrol,Mr.Deuelwouldbeentitledtoreceiveanamountequal\nto150%ofthesumofhisbasesalaryplushisthree-yearaverageannualbonus(“BaseCompensation”),payablein\nmonthly installments over a 24-month period.The other executives would be entitled to receive an amount equal to\n100% of their Base Compensation, payable in monthly installments over a 24-month period. For a Termination in\nconnection with a change in control, Mr. Deuel would be entitled to receive a lump sum equal to 300% of his Base\nCompensation, and the other executives would be entitled to receive a lump sum equal to 200% of their Base\nCompensation. In the event of a TTTermination, each of the executives and their eligible dependents would also be\nentitled to continued coverage under the medical and dental plans of Heritage at active employee rates fffor 18\nmonths; provided that, such period is 12 months for each executive other than Mr. Deuel if theTTTermination is not in\nconnection with a change in control. The employment agreements also provide for accelerated vesting of\noutstandingequityawardsandanyunvestedHeritagecontributionstotheDeferredCompensationPlanintheevent\nof a TTTermination. All unvested awards subject to perrrformance or target requirements will be treated as having\nsatisfied all service-based vesting requirements, and perrrformance-based vesting requirements will be based upon\nactualCompanyperffformanceduringtheapplicableperiodsasiftheNEOshadcontinuedservicethroughtheendof\nthe applicable perrrformance period (without proration fffor duration of employment); provided, however, that if the\nTermination occurs in connection with a change in control, awards subject to vesting, perrrformance, or target\nrequirementswillvestatatargetlevelofperrrformance(withoutprorationfffordurationofemployment).\nAll severance benefits under the employment agreements are contingent upon execution and non-revocation of a\ngeneral release and waiver of claims against Heritage. The agreements are subject to certain banking regulatory\nprovisions and include a clawback provision should any severance payment require recapture under any applicable\nstatute, law, regulation or regulatory interpretation or guidance. Further, the agreements provide for an automatic\nreductionofseverancepaymentscontingentonachangeincontrolifthereductionwouldresultinabetternet-after-\ntax result fffor the executive afffter taking into account the impact of the golden parachute payment restrictions of\nSections280Gand4999oftheInternalRevenueCode.\n46\nThe employment agreements contain restrictive covenants prohibiting indefinitely the unauthorized disclosure of\nconfidential inffformation of Heritage by the executives during and afffter their employment with Heritage, and\nprohibiting the executives from competing with Heritage and from soliciting its employees or customers during\nemployment and after termination of employment for any reason during the following periods: fffor Mr. Deuel, the\nnon-competitionandnon-solicitationcovenantsapplyffforaperiodof24monthsfollowingterminationofemployment\nfor any reason; and fffor the other executives, the non-competition restrictions apply fffor a period of 12 months\nfollowing termination of employment for any reason and the non-solicitation restrictions apply fffor a period of 24\nmonths following termination of employment for any reason. With respect to all of the executives, the restricted\nperiod reduces to 12 months if the termination is in connection with a change in control, and terminates on the\nexecutive’s final day of employment if Heritage delivers a notice of non-renewal of the agreement and then\nterminatestheexecutive’semploymentuponorfollowingtheexpirationoftheagreementterm.\nEquity Plans\nHeritage currently maintains the Heritage Financial Corporation 2023 Omnibus Equity Plan and the Heritage\nFinancial Corporation 2014 Omnibus Equity Plan. Upon approval of the 2023 Omnibus Equity Plan, additional\ngrants under the 2014 Omnibus Equity Plan were no longer permitted, but the 2014 Omnibus Equity Plan will\nremainineffffectforaslongasgrantsthereunderremainoutstanding.ThesePlansprovideffforacceleratedvestingof\nawards upon disability or death.The 2023 Omnibus Equity Plan contains a “double trigger” vesting provision, which\nprovides that in the event of a change in control, all outstanding awards will become immediately exercisable or\nvested, with perrrformance-based awards becoming partially vested based upon target level perrrformance (without\nproration fffor duration of employment) and the acquirer does not assume outstanding awards or provide substitute\nequivalent awards, or if the award recipient is terminated without cause or if the award recipient terminates his or\nher own employment for good reason within 24 months following a change in control.

In addition, Mr. McDonald has an additional life insurance benefit of $50,000, through a plan that was in\nplacewithWhidbeyIslandBankbeforeitwasacquiredbyHeritage.\nManagement Incentive Plan\nIn the case of a death or disability, the Management Incentive Plan allows for prorated payments fffor time worked\nduring the perrrformance period. Once the plan year concludes, the incentive award will be calculated based on\nestablishedperrrformancegoalsandpaidinasimilartimeandmanneraspaymentstootherparticipants.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nThe members of the Compensation Committee are Directors Ellwanger, Giacobbe, Lyon, Rivera, and Watson. No\nmembers of this Committee were officers or employees of Heritage or its subsidiaries during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 or as of March 11, 2024, nor were they formerly offfficers or had any relationships otherrrwise\nrequiringdisclosure.\nCEO Pay Ratio\nIn August 2015, the SEC adopted a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act requiring disclosure of the ratio of the CEO's\nannual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the median employee. In determining our median\nemployee, a list of all full-time and part-time employees, exclusive of our CEO, Mr. Deuel, was prepared based on\nactive employees included in the Company's payroll system as of December 31, 2023. Gross wages were ranked\n47\nfrom highest to lowest to determine the median employee. The annual total compensation of the median employee\nwas then calculated in the same manner as the total compensation disclosed for Mr. Deuel in the Summary\nCompensationTTTableshownabove.TheratiooftheCEO'scompensationtothemedianemployee'scompensationis\nasfollows:\nAnnualTotalCompensationofCEO $ 1,609,640\nAnnualTotalCompensationoftheMedianEmployee $ 76,625\nRatioofCEOtoMedianEmployeeCompensation 21.0:1.0\nThis pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and\nemployment records and the methodology described above. Because the SEC's rules fffor identifffying the median\ncompensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow\ncompanies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and\nassumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be\ncomparabletoourpayratio.\nPay Versus Performance\nIn accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtectionAct of 2010, we provide the following disclosure regarding executive compensation actually paid (\"CAP\")\nand certain Company perffformance fffor the fiscal years listed below.

          "content": "2023\nANNUAL REPORT\n\nMarch 22, 2024\nDear Fellow Shareholders:\nThe past year has been a challenging year for the banking industry as it started with the\nfailure of the second largest bank in history followed shortly by another large bank. These\nbanks were heavily concentrated and had a large percentage of uninsured deposits. Although\nHeritage’s balance sheet is diverse and our level of uninsured deposits is much lower, we spent\nconsiderable time after these events performing outreach to our customers. This outreach\nstrengthened our customer relationships and confirmed that our customer base is strong.\nHeritage grew total assets by 2.7% and total loans by 7.3%, while maintaining solid credit\nquality with net recoveries on average loans of 0.01%. Capital also remains strong with a 14.1%\ntotal risk-based capital ratio as of December 31, 2023. We did experience declines in deposit\nbalances in 2023 as we saw movement of funds to higher yielding accounts which has been\nconsistent throughout the banking industry; however, we continue to successfully pursue new\ndeposit relationships.\nThroughout 2023, the continued increase in short-term interest rates created pressure on Brian L. Vance\ndeposit costs and we increased our deposit rates to remain competitive in the market. The\ncost of total deposits increased to 0.69% for 2023, up from 0.11% from the prior year. Despite\nthese increases, our net interest margin increased 23 basis points to 3.58% for the year\nended December 31, 2023, compared to 3.35% for the year ended December 31, 2022. We\nunderstand that the continued high short-term rates can negatively impact our long-term\nperformance and, therefore, we took proactive measures to re-structure our balance sheet\nand improve future earnings. We sold $220 million in investment securities with an estimated\nweighted average book yield of 2.42% and purchased $178 million of investment securities\nwith an estimated weighted average book yield of 5.77%. This restructuring resulted in a one-\ntime pretax loss of $12.2 million. This impacted net income for 2023, which was $61.8 million,\nor $1.75 per diluted share, compared to $81.9 million, or $2.31 per diluted share, for the year Jeffrey J. Deuel\nended 2022. We anticipate that the restructuring will add more than $0.12 per diluted share\nannually in future years.\nTo further enhance future earnings, we reviewed our non-interest expenses and took action in\nlate 2023 and early 2024 to reduce contract and employee expenses and estimate that these\nactions will result in another $0.12 per diluted share of estimated profitability improvement.\nOur focus is on shareholder value and is further supported by an increase in quarterly\ndividends to $0.23 per common share during the first quarter of 2024.\nAs we look forward, we are optimistic in the resiliency of the company and our ability to\nexecute on the fundamentals of banking and our strategic business initiatives. We remain\nfocused on providing our employees with a collaborative culture, our customers with\nenhanced services and satisfaction, and our shareholders with increasing shareholder value.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors and the management team, we want to thank you for your\nongoing support of Heritage Financial Corporation.\nSSiinncceerreellyy,,\nBrian L.

Our primary loan offerings comprise lines of credit, term\nequipmentfinancing,andtermrealestateloans.Additionally,wefacilitateloansguaranteedbytheSBA,holdingthedesignation\nof a “preferred lender” by the SBA. Commercial business lending involves distinct risks compared to residential real estate\nlending. Our commercial business loans are primarily made based on our assessment of the cash flow of the borrower and\nsecondarilyontheunderlyingcollateralprovidedbytheborrower.Theunpredictabilityofaborrower'scashflowandthepotential\nfluctuations in collateral values underscore the inherent risks in these loans. While our commercial business loans are often\ncollateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of\ndefault is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be\nobsolete or of limited use, among other things.Accordingly, the repayment of commercial business loans primarily relies on the\nborrower’scashflowandcreditworthiness,supplementedbytheunderlyingcollateral.\nAtDecember31,2023,ourcommercialbusinessloanstotaled$3.37billion,or77.8%ofourtotalloanportfolio,ofwhich\n$4.5million,or0.1%ofcommercialbusinessloanswereclassifiedasnonaccrual.Withincommercialbusinessloans,agricultural\n16\nloanstotaled$65.7million,or1.5%ofourtotalloanportfolioand1.9%ofourcommercialbusinessloansatDecember31,2023\nofwhich$825,000,or1.3%ofagriculturalloanswereclassifiedasnonaccrualloans.\nOur portfolio encompasses owner and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including multifamily\nresidential real estate loans. These loans often involve higher principal amounts compared to other loan types, and\ntheirrepaymentmaybecontingentonfactorsbeyondourorourborrowers'control.\nWeoriginatecommercialrealestateloansforindividualsandbusinesses,whicharesecuredbycommercialproperties.\nThese loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans and repayment is dependent upon income\ngenerated,orexpectedtobegenerated,bythepropertysecuringtheloaninamountssufficienttocoveroperatingexpensesand\ndebt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. For example, if the\nproject's cash flow diminishes due to unobtained or unrenewed leases, the borrower’s capacity to repay the loan could be\nimpaired.Additionally, many of these loans have adjustable rates and reprice periodically.Asignificant increase in rates could\nincreasethepaymentamountandcouldimpacttheborrower’sabilitytorepaytheloan.\nCommercial real estate lending also exposes us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate.\nTypically, the collateral securing these loans is not as easily liquidated as residential properties. In addition, many of our\ncommercialrealestateloansarenotfullyamortizingandcontainlargeballoonpaymentsuponmaturity.Suchballoonpayments\nmay require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property, potentially elevating the risk of default or non-\npayment. If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer compared to\nresidential real estate loans due to fewer potential purchasers. Additionally, commercial real estate loans generally have\nrelatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers, magnifying the impact of any errors in judgment\nregarding their collectability. Consequently, resulting charge-offs per loan may be larger than those incurred with our residential\norconsumerloanportfolios.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our owner and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $2.66 billion, or\n61.2%ofourtotalloanportfolio,ofwhich$205,000wereclassifiedasnonaccrual.\nOurrealestateconstructionandlanddevelopmentloansarebaseduponestimatesofcostsandnetoperatingincome\nandtherelatedvalueassociatedwiththecompletedproject.Theseestimatesmaybeinaccurate.\nConstruction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent commercial and residential real estate\nlendingbecausefundsareadvanceduponthecollateralfortheprojectbasedonanestimateofcoststoproduceafutureproject\nvalue at completion. Estimating construction costs, the project's market value upon completion, and the impact of regulatory\nchanges on real property involve inherent uncertainties. Accurately evaluating the total funds required for a project and the\nresulting loan-to-value ratio upon completion is challenging. Unforeseen changes in demand or higher building costs may\nsignificantly deviate from initial estimates. This type of lending also typically involves large loan principal amounts and may be\nconcentrated among a limited number of builders. A downturn in the housing or the real estate market could increase\ndelinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, significantly impairing the value of our collateral and our ability to sell it upon\nforeclosure.Further,someborrowershavemultipleloansoutstandingwithus,exposingustohigherriskifonecreditrelationship\nencountersadversedevelopments..\nConstruction loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of\ntheultimateprojectandtheabilityoftheborrowertosellorleasethepropertyorobtainpermanenttake-outfinancing,ratherthan\ntheabilityoftheborrowerorguarantortorepayprincipalandinterest.Ifourappraisalofthevalueofacompletedprojectproves\ntobeoverstated,wemayhaveinadequatesecurityfortherepaymentoftheloanuponcompletionofconstructionoftheproject\nandmayincuraloss.

In the case of speculative construction loans, there is added risk associated with identifying an end-tenant or\nend-purchaser for the finished project. Land development loans also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being\nproducedbythepropertyandpotentiallyilliquidnatureofthecollateral.Theseriskscanbesignificantlyimpactedbysupplyand\ndemandconditions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our real estate construction and land development loans totaled $414.4 million, or 9.5% of\nourtotalloanportfolio,ofwhich$78.6million,or1.8%ofourtotalloanportfolio,wereresidentialconstructionand$335.8million,\nor 7.7% of our total loan portfolio, were commercial and multifamily construction. All of these loans were performing in\naccordancewiththeirrepaymenttermsasofDecember31,2023.\nOurACLonloansmayprovetobeinsufficienttoabsorblossesinourloanportfolio.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business. Every loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in\naccordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment.

Bank regulatory agencies also periodically review ourACLon loans and may require an increase in the provision\nfor credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on their judgments about information available to them at\nthe time of their examination.

If the FOMC further increases the targeted federal funds\nrate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact both the housing market, by reducing refinancing activity\nandnewhomepurchases,andtheU.S.economy.\nAs is the case with many financial institutions, we have focused on growing core deposits—deposits with no or low\ninterest rates and no specified maturity—which has been challenging over the past couple years. In a rising interest rate\nenvironment, retaining these deposits could result in higher funding costs. If the rates paid on deposits and other borrowings\nincrease faster than the rates earned on loans and investments, our net interest income and earnings could be adversely\naffected. Conversely, if we do not adjust our deposit interest rates to remain competitive with other banks or alternative\ninvestment options, we might experience a decrease in deposits, potentially leading to either reduced earning assets or higher\nborrowings.Bothscenarioscouldpotentiallycauseadeclineinearnings.\nChangesininterestratesalsoaffectthevalueofouravailableforsaleinvestmentsecuritiesportfolio.Generally,thefair\nvalue of fixed-rate investment securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.

If such activities are detected, financial institutions are\nobligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These\nrules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open\nnew financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get\nregulatory approval of acquisitions.

In accordance with GAAP, we assess our goodwill for\nimpairment annually, or more frequently if specific events suggest potential impairment.

Assessing the fair value of goodwill involves considerable judgment.

We rely on\ncustomer deposits and borrowings from the FHLB and certain other wholesale funding sources to fund our operations. Deposit\nflows and the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related investment securities are strongly influenced by such external factors\nas the direction of interest rates, whether actual or perceived, and the competition for deposits and loans in the markets we\nserve. Further, changes to the FHLB's underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict\nour ability to borrow and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity.Although we have historically been\nable to replace maturing deposits and borrowings if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among\nother things, our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB or market conditions change. Factors that could\ndetrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a\ndownturn in the markets in which our loans and deposits are concentrated, negative operating results, or adverse regulatory\naction against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the\nfinancial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry or deterioration in\ncredit markets.Any decline in available funding in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable\ncouldadverselyimpactourabilitytooriginateloans,investinsecurities,meetourexpenses,orfulfillobligationssuchasrepaying\nour borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness,financialconditionandresultsofoperations.\n23\nAdditionally,collateralizedpublicfundsarebankdepositsofstateandlocalmunicipalities.Thesedepositsarerequired\ntobesecuredbycertaininvestmentgradesecuritiestoensurerepayment,whichontheonehandtendstoreduceourcontingent\nliquidityriskbymakingthesefundssomewhatlesscreditsensitive,butontheotherhandreducesstandbyliquiditybyrestricting\nthepotentialliquidityofthepledgedcollateral.Althoughthesefundshistoricallyhavebeenarelativelystablesourceoffundsfor\nus, availability depends on the individual municipality's fiscal policies and cash flow needs.

We provide financial services to our local communities with an\nongoingstrategicfocusonourcommercialbankingrelationships,marketexpansionandassetquality.TheCompany’sbusiness\nactivities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in the Bank. Accordingly, the\ninformationsetforthinthisreportrelatesprimarilytotheBank’soperations.\nOurbusinessconsistsprimarilyofcommerciallendinganddepositrelationshipswithsmalltomediumsizedbusinesses\nandtheirownersinourmarketareasandattractingdepositsfromthegeneralpublic.Wealsooriginaterealestateconstruction\nandlanddevelopmentloans,residentialrealestateloansandconsumerloans,primarilyinourmarkets.\nOur core profitability depends primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between\ninterest income, which is the income that we earn on interest earning assets, comprised primarily of loans and investment\nsecurities, and interest expense, which is the amount we pay on our interest bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits\nand borrowings. Management manages the repricing characteristics of the Company's interest earning assets and interest\nbearing liabilities to protect net interest income from changes in market interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield\ncurve.Likemostfinancialinstitutions,ournetinterestincomeissignificantlyaffectedbygeneralandlocaleconomicconditions,\nparticularlychangesinmarket interest rates, includingrecentlysignificantchangesas aresult of inflation, and bygovernmental\npolicies and actions of regulatory agencies. Net interest income is additionally affected by changes in the volume and mix of\ninterest earning assets, interest earned on these assets, the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest paid on\ntheseliabilities.\nOur net income is affected by many factors, including the provision for credit losses on loans. The provision for credit\nlosses on loans is dependent on changes in the loan portfolio and management’s assessment of the collectability of the loan\nportfolio as well as prevailing economic and market conditions. Management believes that the ACL on loans reflects the\nappropriateamounttoprovideforcurrentexpectedcreditlossesinourloanportfoliobasedontheCECLmethodology.\nNet income is also affected by noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income primarily consists of\nservice charges and other fees, card revenue and other income. Noninterest expense consists primarily of compensation and\nemployeebenefits,occupancyandequipment,dataprocessingandprofessionalservices.Compensationandemployeebenefits\nconsist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee\nbenefits.Occupancyandequipmentexpensesarethefixedandvariablecostsofbuildingsandequipmentandconsistsprimarily\nof lease expenses, depreciation charges, maintenance and utilities. Data processing consists primarily of processing and\nnetwork services related to the Bank’s core operating system, including the account processing system, electronic payments\nprocessing of products and services, internet and mobile banking channels and software-as-a-service providers. Professional\nservicesconsistprimarilyofthird-partyserviceproviderssuchasauditors,consultantsandlawyers.\nResults of operations may also be significantly affected by general and local economic and competitive conditions,\nchanges in accounting, tax and regulatory rules, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities, including changes\nresulting from inflation and the governmental actions taken to address these issues. Net income is also impacted by growth of\noperationsthroughorganicgrowthoracquisitions.\nResultsofOperations\nNet income was $61.8 million, or $1.75 per diluted common share, for theyear ended December 31, 2023down from\n$81.9million,or$2.31perdilutedcommonshare,fortheyearendedDecember31,2022.Netincomedecreased$20.1million,\nor24.6%,comparedtoDecember31,2022duetolossesonsalesofinvestmentsecuritiesof$12.2millionlargelyasaresultof\ninvestment portfolio repositioning, an increase in noninterest expense of $15.7 million including an $8.0 million increase in\ncompensationandemployeebenefits,andanincreaseintheprovisionforcreditlossesof$5.7millionresultingfromaprovision\nforcreditlossesof$4.3millionfortheyearendedDecember31,2023comparedtoareversaloftheprovisionforcreditlossesof\n28\n$1.4 million during 2022.

In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their\nexamination process, periodically review the Company’s ACL on loans.

QUANTITATIVEANDQUALITATIVEDISCLOSURESABOUTMARKETRISK\nMarketriskrepresentstheriskoflossduetochangesinmarketvaluesofassetsandliabilities.Weincurmarketriskin\nthe normal course of business through our exposure to market interest rates, equity prices and credit spreads. Our primary\nmarket risk is interest rate risk, which is the risk of loss of net interest income or net interest margin resulting from changes in\nmarket interest rates. Interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities in which the Company engages,\nsuch as gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in\n42\ninterestratesandconsumerpreferences,affectthedifferencebetweentheinterestearnedonourassetsandtheinterestpaidon\nourliabilities.\nOur Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for developing, monitoring and reviewing asset/liability\nprocesses, interest rate risk exposures, strategies and tactics and reporting to the Board of Directors' Risk and Technology\nCommittee.ItistheresponsibilityoftheBoardofDirectorstoestablishpoliciesandinterestratelimitsandapprovethesepolicies\nandinterestratelimitsannually.Itistheresponsibilityofmanagementtoexecutetheapprovedpolicies,developandimplement\nrisk management strategies and to report to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.

The policy guidelines direct\nmanagementtoassesstheimpactofchangesininterestratesuponbothearningsandcapital.Theseguidelinesestablishlimits\nforinterestraterisksensitivity.\nNetiiinterestiiincomesimulatttion\nWe use an income simulation model as the primary tool to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net\ninterest income resulting from changes in interest rates. Modeling the sensitivity of net interest income is highly dependent on\nnumerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process. Key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on\nloans and investment securities, repricing betas on non-maturity deposits, and repricing on investment securities, loans, and\nborrowings. In order to measure the interest rate risk sensitivity as of December 31, 2023, this simulation model uses a “static\nbalance sheet” assumption, meaning the size and mix of the balance sheet remains the same as maturing cash flows from\nassets and liabilities are reinvested into the same categories at the current level of interest rates.The simulation also assumes\naninstantaneousandsustaineduniformchangeinmarketinterestratesatallmaturities.\nThefffollowingtablesummarizestheestimatedeffffectonnetinterestincomeovera12monthperiodmeasuredagainsta\nflatrate(nointerestratechange)scenariofortheperiodsindicated:\nDecember31,2023 December31,2022\n$Changein %Changein $Changein %Changein\nNetInterest NetInterest NetInterest NetInterest\nIncome Income Income Income\nChangeinInterestRates(BasisPoints) (Dollarsinthousands)\n+200(shock) $ 1,438 0.6% $ 8,181 3.2%\n+100(shock) 1,644 0.7 5,113 2.0\n+0(flat) — — — —\n-100(shock) 1,861 0.8 (5,433) (2.1)\n-200(shock) 1,549 0.7 (16,840) (6.6)\nTheCompany’sbalancesheetsensitivitytochangesinmarketratesissomewhatneutral,meaningresultsaresimilarin\nthe rates up and down scenarios over a twelve month time horizon.The Company is less asset sensitive than in the prior year\ndueprimarilytoadecreaseininterestearningdepositsthatrepricedaily.\nThe simulation results noted above do not incorporate any management actions that might moderate the negative\nconsequencesofinterestratedeviations.Inaddition,thesimulationresultsnotedabovecontainvariousassumptionssuchasa\nstatic balance sheet, and the rate that deposit interest rates change as market interest rates change.

The evaluation of ACL on loans is inherently\nsubjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. While\nmanagementutilizesitsbestjudgmentandinformationavailabletorecognizeestimatedlossesonloans,futureadditionstothe\nallowancemaybenecessarybasedonfurtherdeclinesinlocalandnationaleconomicconditions.\nTheCompanyprimarilyusesahistoricloss,openpoolcreditlossmethodologytocalculatetheACLonloans,whichthe\nCompanyhasappliedtoidentifiedloansegmentswithsimilarriskcharacteristics.Theallowanceforcollectivelyevaluatedloans\nis comprised of the baseline loss allowance, the macroeconomic allowance, and the qualitative allowance. The baseline loss\nallowance begins with the baseline loss rates calculated using average quarterly historical loss information for an economic\ncycle.The baseline loss rates are applied to each loan's estimated cash flows over the life of the loan under the remaining life\nmethod to determine the baseline loss estimate for each loan. The Company uses macroeconomic scenarios from an\nindependent third party.These scenarios are based on past events, current conditions, the likelihood of future events occurring\nand include consideration of the forecasted direction of the economic and business environment and its likely impact on the\nestimated allowance as compared to the historical losses over the reasonable and supportable time frame. Management also\nconsiders other qualitative risk factors to further adjust the estimated ACL on loans through a qualitative allowance. These\nadjustments are subjectively selected by management and are based primarily on established macroeconomic factors

These\nestimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided. Management\nbelieves that the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are\nappropriate based on the facts and circumstances at the time. Actual results, however, could differ significantly from those\nestimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to management's estimate of theACL\non investment securities, management's estimate of the ACL on loans, management's estimate of the ACL on unfunded\ncommitments, management's evaluation of goodwill impairment and management's estimate of the fair value of financial\ninstruments.\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, the Bank.

The Company records the\nchangesintheACLonloansthroughearningsasa\"Provisionfor(reversalof)creditlosses\"ontheConsolidatedStatementsof\nIncome.\nManagement has adopted a historic loss, open pool CECL methodology to calculate the ACL on loans. Under this\nmethodology,loansareeithercollectivelyevaluatediftheysharesimilarriskcharacteristics,includingperformingmodifiedloans,\norindividuallyevaluatediftheydonotsharesimilarriskcharacteristics,includingnonaccrualloans.\nThe allowance for individually evaluated loans is calculated using either the collateral value method, which considers\nthelikelysourceofrepaymentasthevalueofthecollaterallessestimatedcoststosell,orthenetpresentvaluemethod,which\nconsiders the contractual principal and interest terms and estimated cash flows available from the borrower to satisfy the debt.\nNonaccrual modified loans are individually evaluated for credit loss except if the original interest rate is used to discount the\nexpectedcashflows,nottheratespecifiedintherestructuring.\nThe allowance for collectively evaluated loans is comprised of the baseline loss allowance, the macroeconomic\nallowance and the qualitative allowance. The baseline loss allowance begins with the baseline loss rates calculated using the\nCompany'saveragequarterlyhistoricallossinformationforaneconomiccycle.TheCompanyevaluatesthehistoricalperiodona\nquarterly basis with the assumption that economic cycles have historically lasted between 10 and 15 years. The baseline loss\nrates are applied to each loan's estimated cash flows over the life of the loan under the remaining life method to determine the\nbaselinelossestimateforeachloan.Estimatedcashflowsconsidertheprincipalandinterestinaccordancewiththecontractual\nterm of the loan and estimated prepayments. Contractual cash flows are based on the amortized cost and are adjusted for\nbalances guaranteed by governmental entities, such as SBA or USDA, resulting in the unguaranteed amortized cost. The\ncontractualtermexcludesexpectedextensions,renewalsandmodificationsunlesstheextensionorrenewaloptionsareincluded\nin the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. Prepayments\nare established for each segment based on historical averages for the segment, which management believes is an accurate\nrepresentation of future prepayment activity. Management reviews the adequacy of the prepayment assumption on a quarterly\nbasis.\nThe macroeconomic allowance includes consideration of the forecasted direction of the economic and business\nenvironment and its likely impact on the estimated allowance as compared to the historical losses over the reasonable and\nsupportable time frame. The Company uses macroeconomic scenarios from an independent third party. These scenarios are\nbased on past events, current conditions, the likelihood of future events occurring and include consideration of the forecasted\ndirection of the economic and business environment and its likely impact on the estimated allowance as compared to the\nhistoricallossesoverthereasonableandsupportabletimeframe.Economicforecastmodelsforthecurrentperiodareuploaded\nto the model, which targets certain forecasted macroeconomic factors, such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product,\nhousing price index, commercial real estate price index, and certain rate and market indices.

Changes were based on\nregression testing, assessing the macroeconomic variable relationships to expected results and adjusting the lookback period\nfrom 1991 to 2000 for improved data relevance. The most significant changes to macroeconomic variables were in the\ncommercial and industrial and commercial real estate segments. The commercial and industrial segment had previously used\nunemployment as a macroeconomic variable which was removed and replaced with a market index, rate index and real estate\nprice index. The commercial real estate segment had previously used gross domestic product as a macroeconomic variable\n54\nwhich was removed and replaced with a housing price index.Additionally, a new segment for home equity lines of credit was\nintroducedinthisversion.TheoverallimpactontheACLforcollectivelyevaluatedloans,beforeapplyingqualitativeadjustments,\nwasnotconsideredtobematerial.\nThe Company’s ACL model also includes adjustments for qualitative factors, where appropriate. Since historical\ninformation (such as historical net losses and economic cycles) may not always, by themselves, provide a sufficient basis for\ndetermining future expected credit losses, the Company periodically considers the need for qualitative adjustments to theACL.\nQualitative adjustments may be related to and include, but not be limited to, factors such as: (i) management’s assessment of\neconomic forecasts used in the model and how those forecasts align with management’s overall evaluation of current and\nexpected economic conditions, (ii) organization specific risks such as credit concentrations, collateral specific risks, regulatory\nrisks, and external factors that may ultimately impact credit quality, (iii) potential model limitations such as those identified\nthrough back-testing, underwriting changes, acquisition of new portfolios and changes in portfolio segmentation, and (iv)\nmanagement’soverallassessmentoftheadequacyoftheACL,includinganassessmentofmodeldatainputsusedtodetermine\ntheACL.\nAsofDecember31,2023,qualitativeadjustmentsprimarilyrelatedtocertainsegmentsoftheloanportfoliodeemedby\nmanagementtobeofahigher-riskprofilewheremanagementbelievesthequantitativecomponentoftheCompany’sACLmodel\nmaynothavefullycapturedtheassociatedimpacttotheACL.Qualitativeadjustmentsalsorelatedtoheighteneduncertaintyas\nto future macroeconomic conditions and the related impact on certain loan segments.

In addition, various\nregulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s ACL on loans.

Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into\ngroupings based on predominant risk characteristics including investor type, loan type and maturity and recognized through a\nvaluation allowance for an individual stratum to the extent fair value is less than the carrying amount.

Basic earnings per\ncommon share is net income allocated to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period.

Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to\nparticipatingsecuritiesareexcludedfromnetincomeallocatedtocommonshareholdersandparticipatingsecuritiesareexcluded\nfrom weighted average common shares outstanding.

In the case of loans secured by accounts\nreceivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the\nborrower to collect amounts due from its customers. Commercial and industrial loans carry more risk than other loans because\nthe borrowers’ cash flow is less predictable and in the event of a default the amount of loss is potentially greater and more\ndifficult to quantify because the value of the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate, may be uncollectible or may be\nobsoleteoroflimiteduse,amongotherthings.\nOwner-occupiedandnon-owneroccupiedCRE.TheCompanyoriginatesCREloansprimarilywithinitsprimarymarket\nareas.Theseloansaresubjecttounderwritingstandardsandprocessessimilartocommercialandindustrialloansinthatthese\nloansareviewedprimarilyascashflowloansandsecondarilyasloanssecuredbyrealestateproperties.CRElendingtypically\ninvolves higher loan principal amounts and payments on loans and repayment is dependent on successful operation and\nmanagementoftheproperties.Thevalueoftherealestatesecuringtheseloanscanbeadverselyaffectedbyconditionsinthe\nreal estate market or the economy.There is some common risk characteristics with owner-occupied CRE loans and non-owner\noccupied CRE loans.

In addition to originating residential real estate loans, the Company began purchasing pools of\nresidentialrealestateloansduringtheyearended2022.AllpurchasedloansadheretotheCompany'sunderwritingstandards.\nRealEstateConstructionandLandDevelopment:\nThe Company originates construction loans for residential and for commercial and multifamily properties. The\nresidential construction loans generally include construction of custom single-family homes whereby the homeowner is the\nborrower. The Company also provides financing to builders for the construction of pre-sold residential homes and, in selected\ncases,tobuildersfortheconstructionofspeculativesingle-familyresidentialproperty.Constructionloansaretypicallyshort-term\nin nature and priced with variable rates of interest. Construction loans may also be originated as a construction-to-permanent\nfinancingloanwherebyuponcompletionoftheconstructionphase,theloanisautomaticallyconvertedtoapermanenttermloan.\nConstruction lending can involve a higher level of risk than other types of lending because funds are advanced partially based\nupon the value of the project, which is uncertain prior to the project’s completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in\nestimating construction costs as well as the market value of a completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of\nrealproperty,theCompany’sestimateswithregardtothetotalfundsrequiredtocompleteaprojectandtherelatedloan-to-value\nratio may vary from actual results.

Sources of\nrepaymentforthesetypesofloansmaybepre-committedpermanentloansfromapprovedlong-termlenders,salesofdeveloped\nproperty or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely\nmonitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate\nrepayment being dependent upon successful completion of the construction project, market interest rate changes, government\nregulationofrealproperty,generaleconomicconditionsandtheavailabilityoflong-termfinancing.\nConsumer:\nThe Company originates consumer loans and lines of credit that are both secured and unsecured. The underwriting\nprocess for these loans ensures a qualifying primary and secondary source of repayment. Underwriting standards for home\nequityloansaresignificantlyinfluencedbystatutoryrequirements,whichinclude,butarenotlimitedto,amaximumloan-to-value\npercentage of 80%, collection remedies, the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation\nrequirements.Tomonitorandmanageconsumerloanrisk,policiesandproceduresaredevelopedandmodified,asneeded.The\nmajority of consumer loans are for relatively small amounts disbursed among many individual borrowers which reduces the\noverallcreditriskforthissegment.Tofurtherreducetherisk,trendreportsarereviewedbymanagementonaregularbasis.\nThe Company also purchased indirect consumer loans.

These borrowers generally have strong to acceptable capital levels and consistent earnings\nanddebtservicecapacity.Loanswiththehighergradeswithinthe“Pass”categorymayincludeborrowerswho\nare experiencing unusual operating difficulties, but have acceptable payment performance to date.

Loans with this grade\nshowsignsofdeterioratingprofitsandcapitalandtheborrowermightnotbestrongenoughtosustainamajor\nsetback. The borrower is typically higher than normally leveraged and outside support might be modest and\nlikely illiquid. The loan is at risk of further credit decline unless active measures are taken to correct the\nsituation.\n• Grade 8:This grade includes “Substandard” (\"SS\") loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines, which the\nCompany has determined have a high credit risk. These loans also have well-defined weaknesses and are\ncharacterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not\ncorrected. The borrower may have shown serious negative trends in financial ratios and performance. Such\nloans may be dependent upon collateral liquidation, a secondary source of repayment or an event outside of\nthenormalcourseofbusiness.\n• Grade9:Thisgradeincludes“Doubtful”loansinaccordancewithregulatoryguidelinesandtheCompanyhas\ndeterminedtheseloanstohaveexcessivecreditrisk.Suchloansareplacedonnonaccrualstatusandmaybe\ndependent upon collateral having a value that is difficult to determine or upon some near-term event which\nlacks certainty.Additionally, these loans generally have been partially charged off for the amount considered\nuncollectible.\n• Grade 10: This grade includes “Loss” loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines and the Company has\ndetermined these loans have the highest risk of loss. Such loans are charged off or charged down when\npaymentisacknowledgedtobeuncertainorwhenthetimingorvalueofpaymentscannotbedetermined.\nNumericalloangradesforloansareestablishedattheoriginationoftheloan.Changestoloangradesareconsideredat\nthe time new information about the performance of a loan becomes available, including the receipt of updated financial\ninformation from the borrower, results of annual term loan reviews and scheduled loan reviews. For consumer loans, the\nCompany follows the FDIC’s Uniform Retail Credit Classification andAccount Management Policy for subsequent classification\nin the event of payment delinquencies or default. Typically, an individual loan grade will not be changed from the prior period\nunless there is a specific indication of credit deterioration or improvement. Credit deterioration is evidenced by delinquency,\ndirect communications with the borrower or other borrower information that becomes known to management.
