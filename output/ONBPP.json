This was the case for Old National in 2023—a year when\nour company, and the team members that drive our success, demonstrated what it means to care for\nour clients, our communities and one another.\nBack in March, when the financial industry\nexperienced liquidity issues at a small number\nof niche banks, the strength and stability of Old\nNational’s franchise became more evident than ever.\nNot only did we continue to passionately serve our\nclients, but we also expanded our commitment to\naddressing the needs of underserved communities\nthrough a new Empowerment Small Business Loan\nProgram (see page 18).\nA month later, a tragic act of violence in Louisville\ntook the lives of five of our team members (see\npage 25 for a tribute to those we lost). During this\nunimaginably difficult time, our Old National family\nwas sustained by an immense outpouring of love and\nsupport from throughout the country. Nearly one year\nlater, we remain incredibly grateful for that support\nas we continue to grieve, heal and remember.\nWhile there is no way to adequately thank all those\nwho stood by our side, our team members did their\nbest to pay that love, care and support forward during\nour September “Better Together Days.” During this\ntwo-day volunteer blitz, our team members donated\nOld National Chairman and CEO Jim Ryan (front left), Louisville Market President\nDennis Heishman (front right) and a group of other Old National team members 7,200+ collective hours of service in partnership with\npause for a selfie during a Better Together Days volunteer event last fall in Louisville. 175 community organizations (see recap on pages 28\nand 29).\nIt’s worth noting that Better Together Days is a microcosm of our year-round approach to supporting\nand sustaining the communities we call home. In 2023 alone, our organizational giving (grants and\nsponsorships) topped $11.8 million while our team members donated 57,369 volunteer hours.\nThis 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report captures the key events of a year\nthat placed a premium on family and culture while proving that our organizational values are not\nmerely words on paper. If it is possible to sum all of this up in a single phrase, that phrase would be\n“Banking with Heart.” This simple yet powerful approach to banking, community sustainability, and\nthe growth and development of our team members, continues to set Old National apart.\nSincerely,\nJim Ryan Becky Skillman\nCHAIRMAN & CEO LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR\nOld National Bancorp 2023 ESG Report | 3\nINTRODUCTION\n1\n• Our Mission, Vision and Values\n• Better Together by the Numbers\n• ESG at a Glance\n• Continued Growth\n• Partnering with Our Stakeholders\nABOUT THIS REPORT\nThis 2023 ESG Report covers a number of topics, We do all of this while striving daily to strengthen and\nincluding governance and ethics; client service; team support the communities in which we live and work.\nmember growth and development; diversity, equity and And we rely on oversight and guidance from a strong,\ninclusion; community engagement; and sustainability. independent Corporate Board to help us achieve these\nWhen viewed together, these topics form the pillars of goals.\nOld National’s corporate social responsibility strategy\nAll data in this report is as of December 31, 2023,\nas a regional bank and help define our community\nunless otherwise noted.
