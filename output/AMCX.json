Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nNovember 8, 2024 at 8:30 AM EST\n\n[Download PDF](/static-files/4f4e7744-f727-455f-90fd-caed391d9faf \"3Q'24_Release_Final.pdf\") 319.2 KB\n\nNEW YORK, Nov. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMC Networks Inc. (\"AMC Networks\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: AMCX) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Chief Executive Officer Kristin Dolan **said: \"As we manage this business within a complex and changing environment, we remain focused on our key strategic pillars - programming, partnerships and profitability. During the quarter, we made significant advancements across all three areas. We have generated $293 million of free cash flow year to date and are well on our way to delivering our stated goal of approximately half a billion dollars in cumulative free cash over two years. We also entered into new and enhanced partnerships with major companies like Charter, Netflix, Amazon and others which are driving our company forward as we continue to provide distinctive, high-quality programming to customers across an expanding array of platforms.\"\n\n**Operational Highlights:**\n\n  * Renewed several major affiliate agreements, including an early renewal with Charter which includes the ad-supported version of AMC+ being bundled to Charter video customers at no additional cost to the customer.\n\n  * Launched prior seasons of 13 AMC series on Netflix. Branded \"The AMC Collection,\" the shows delivered strong initial performance on Netflix and viewership and acquisition gains for new seasons on AMC+.\n\n  * Continued momentum in FAST with launch of 15 AMC Networks' FAST channels on Amazon Platforms.\n\n  * Launched a promotional content sampling arrangement with AMC+ and MGM+, bringing first seasons of nine AMC+ series to MGM+ and first seasons of nine MGM+ series to AMC+, for the next two months.\n\n  * Expanding key AMC Studios franchises including start of production of the third season of _The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon _and the third series in the Anne Rice Immortal Universe, _The Talamasca._\n\n  * Completed a transaction with BBC Studios to acquire the remaining 50.1% of the BBC America joint venture, providing 100% ownership and full operational control of the iconic BBC America network, while maintaining a commercial relationship with BBC Studios to support the continued strength of the brand and programming.\n\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights – Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024:**\n\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities of $62 million; Free Cash Flow(1) of $54 million, with $293 million generated year to date.\n\n  * Operating income of $94 million in the third quarter; Adjusted Operating Income(1) of $131 million, with a margin of 22%.\n\n  * Net revenues of $600 million decreased 6% from the prior year. Excluding $20 million of revenues in the prior year related to 25/7 Media (which we divested on December 29, 2023), net revenues decreased 3%.\n\n    * Streaming revenues of $152 million increased 7% from the prior year.\n\n  * Diluted EPS of $0.76; Adjusted EPS(1) of $0.91.\n\n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n_Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts_| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \n**Net Revenues**| **$**| **599,614**| **$**| **636,954**| **(5.9**| **)%**| **$**| **1,822,009**| **$**| **2,033,029**| **(10.4**| **)%**  \n**Operating Income**| **$**| **93,653**| **$**| **120,850**| **(22.5**| **)%**| **$**| **214,619**| **$**| **399,855**| **(46.3**| **)%**  \n**Adjusted Operating Income**| **$**| **131,476**| **$**| **177,268**| **(25.8**| **)%**| **$**| **433,407**| **$**| **569,808**| **(23.9**| **)%**  \nDiluted Earnings Per Share| $| 0.76| $| 1.44| (47.2| )%| $| 1.21| $| 5.40| (77.6| )%  \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share| $| 0.91| $| 1.85| (50.8| )%| $| 3.27| $| 6.49| (49.6| )%  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| $| 62,235| $| 106,092| (41.3| )%| $| 317,507| $| 131,139| 142.1| %  \nFree Cash Flow| $| 53,941| $| 99,150| (45.6| )%| $| 293,255| $| 102,747| 185.4| %  \n  \n(1)| See page 5 of this earnings release for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures used in this release.

The decrease in Adjusted Operating Income was primarily driven by revenue headwinds in our linear business.\n\n\n\n\n**International**\n\nThird Quarter Results:\n\n  * International revenues decreased 24% from the prior year to $74 million. The prior period included $20 million of content licensing and other revenues related to 25/7 Media, which we divested on December 29, 2023. Excluding revenues related to 25/7 Media, International revenues decreased 6%.\n\n    * Subscription revenues decreased 14% to $49 million, primarily due to the non-renewal of an AMCNI distribution agreement in the U.K. that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n    * Content licensing and other revenues decreased 88% to $3 million due to the sale of our interest in 25/7 Media in December 2023.\n\n    * Advertising revenues increased 16% to $22 million due to new streaming offerings launched in the U.K. and growth in Central and Northern Europe.\n\n  * Operating income increased 9% to $9 million.\n\n  * Adjusted Operating Income increased 4% to $14 million. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income was primarily driven by advertising revenue growth and favorable corporate allocations. 25/7 Media generated $1 million of AOI in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n**Other Matters**\n\n _BBC America Transaction_\n\nOn November 1, 2024, the Company closed a transaction with BBC Studios in which the Company acquired the remaining 50.1% of the BBC America joint-venture that it had not previously owned for $42.0 million in cash. The Company now owns 100% of the BBC America business, with full operational control, and will continue to fully consolidate BBC America.\n\nAssuming the transaction had closed on September 30, 2024, $132.9 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest related to BBC America, and reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, would have been eliminated. Additionally, the Company’s future contractual programming commitments to BBC Studios would have been significantly reduced.\n\nGoing forward, AMC Networks will no longer be making any related cash distributions to non-controlling interests.\n\n_Partial Prepayment of Term Loan A Facility Borrowings_\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repaid $8.1 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility in accordance with the terms of the amended agreement. Additionally, the Company also voluntarily prepaid $35.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility.\n\n_Stock Repurchase Program & Outstanding Shares_\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock (the \"Stock Repurchase Program\"). The Stock Repurchase Program has no pre-established termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $135 million of authorization remaining for repurchase under the Stock Repurchase Program.\n\nAs of November 1, 2024, the Company had 32,636,371 shares of Class A Common Stock and 11,484,408 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding.\n\nPlease see the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024, which will be filed later today, for further details regarding the above matters.\n\n**Description of Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nInternally, the Company uses net revenues, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), and Free Cash Flow measures as the most important indicators of its business performance and evaluates management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before share-based compensation expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other charges (including gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses), restructuring and other related charges, cloud computing amortization, and including the Company’s proportionate share of adjusted operating income (loss) from majority-owned equity method investees. From time to time, we may exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses, or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) from AOI that affect our operating performance. Because it is based upon operating income (loss), Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of the business without regard to the effect of the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.\n\nThe Company believes that Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the business segments and the Company on a consolidated basis. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts, and peers to compare performance in the industry. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Since Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), please see pages 8-9 of this release.\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, all of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes the most comparable GAAP financial measure of its liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of its overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment, investment, and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses. The Company also believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its liquidity with other companies in the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. For a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow, please see page 11 of this release.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (“Adjusted EPS”), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as earnings per diluted share excluding the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; impairment and other charges (including gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses); non-cash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets; restructuring and other related charges; and the impact associated with the modification of debt arrangements, including gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt; as well as the impact of taxes on the aforementioned items. The Company believes the most comparable GAAP financial measure is earnings per diluted share. The Company believes that Adjusted EPS is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although the Company’s measure of Adjusted EPS may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. For a reconciliation of earnings per diluted share to Adjusted EPS, please see pages 12-13 of this release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis earnings release may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The prior period included $20 million of revenues related to the return of rights from Hulu that resulted in the acceleration of revenue previously anticipated to be recognized in 2024. Excluding prior period revenues associated with the return of rights from Hulu, content licensing revenues increased 10%.\n    * Advertising revenues decreased 11% to $149 million due to linear ratings declines and a challenging ad market, partly offset by digital and advanced advertising revenue growth.\n  * Operating income of $103 million included a long-lived asset impairment charge related to our BBCA joint venture of $29 million.\n  * Adjusted Operating Income decreased 16% to $155 million, with a margin of 29%. The decrease in Adjusted Operating Income was primarily driven by a decrease in revenues, partly offset by continued cost management measures.\n\n\n\n**International**\n\nIn 2024, the Company updated the name of its previously titled \"International and Other\" operating segment to \"International\" following the divestiture of the 25/7 Media business on December 29, 2023, which was the sole component of the operating segment that comprised “Other.” This update does not constitute a change in segment reporting, but rather an update in name only. Prior period segment information contained in this release includes the results of the 25/7 Media business through the date of divestiture.\n\nSecond Quarter Results:\n\n  * International revenues decreased 9% from the prior year to $90 million. The prior period included $19 million of content licensing and other revenues related to 25/7 Media, which we divested on December 29, 2023. Additionally, current period advertising revenue included $13 million of revenue related to a one-time adjustment payment. Excluding revenues related to 25/7 Media and the one-time adjustment payment, International revenues decreased 4%. \n    * Subscription revenues decreased 13% to $50 million, primarily due to the non-renewal of an AMCNI distribution agreement in the UK that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n    * Content licensing and other revenues decreased 86% to $3 million due to the sale of our interest in 25/7 Media in December 2023.\n    * Advertising revenues increased 84% to $38 million due to a $13 million one-time adjustment payment and new streaming offerings in the UK. Excluding the one-time adjustment payment, advertising revenues increased 18%.\n  * Operating loss of $44 million included a goodwill impairment change of $68 million related to AMCNI.\n  * Adjusted Operating Income increased 53% to $29 million. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income was primarily driven by the one-time adjustment payment. 25/7 Media generated $1 million of AOI in the second quarter of 2023. Excluding AOI related to the one-time adjustment payment, International AOI was $16 million, with a margin of 21%.\n\n\n\n**Other Matters**\n\n_Open Market Repurchases of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2029_\n\nIn June 2024, the Company repurchased $15 million principal amount of its 4.25% senior notes due 2029 on the open market, at a discount of $4.9 million, and retired the repurchased notes.\n\n_4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029_\n\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company completed an offering of $143.75 million principal amount of its 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the \"Convertible Notes\"). The Convertible Notes may be converted at an initial conversion rate of 78.5083 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $12.74 per share).\n\n_Impairment and Other Charges_\n\nImpairment and other charges of $97 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 primarily consisted of a $68 million goodwill impairment charge at AMCNI and $29 million of long-lived asset impairment charges at BBCA.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we determined that the decline in our stock price was an indicator of potential impairment of goodwill. Accordingly, we performed quantitative assessments for all of our reporting units and concluded that the fair value of the AMCNI reporting unit declined to less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $68 million, which is included in Impairment and other charges in the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). Additionally, the Company performed a recoverability test and determined that the carrying amount of the BBCA asset group exceeded its fair value, therefore an impairment charge of $29 million was recorded for identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, which is included in Impairment and other charges in the condensed consolidated statement of income (loss) within the Domestic Operations operating segment.\n\n_Stock Repurchase Program & Outstanding Shares_\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. The Stock Repurchase Program has no pre-established end date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $135 million of authorization remaining for repurchase under the Stock Repurchase Program.\n\nAs of August 2, 2024, the Company had 32,613,713 shares of Class A Common Stock and 11,484,408 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding.\n\nPlease see the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, which will be filed later today, for further details regarding the above matters.\n\n**Description of Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nInternally, the Company uses net revenues, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), and Free Cash Flow measures as the most important indicators of its business performance and evaluates management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before share-based compensation expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other charges (including gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses), restructuring and other related charges, cloud computing amortization, and including the Company’s proportionate share of adjusted operating income (loss) from majority-owned equity method investees. From time to time, we may exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses, or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) from AOI that affect our operating performance. Because it is based upon operating income (loss), Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of the business without regard to the effect of the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.\n\nThe Company believes that Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the business segments and the Company on a consolidated basis. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts, and peers to compare performance in the industry. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Since Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), please see pages 8-9 of this release.\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, all of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company believes the most comparable GAAP financial measure of its liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of its overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment, investment, and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses. The Company also believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its liquidity with other companies in the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. For a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow, please see page 11 of this release.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (“Adjusted EPS”), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as earnings per diluted share excluding the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; impairment and other charges (including gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses); non-cash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets; restructuring and other related charges; and the impact associated with the modification of debt arrangements, including gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt; as well as the impact of taxes on the aforementioned items. The Company believes the most comparable GAAP financial measure is earnings per diluted share. The Company believes that Adjusted EPS is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although the Company’s measure of Adjusted EPS may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. For a reconciliation of earnings per diluted share to Adjusted EPS, please see pages 12-13 of this release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis earnings release may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
