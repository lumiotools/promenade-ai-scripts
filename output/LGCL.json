We also had a strong growth of our user base: our active registered users reached 702,060 by June 2024, representing 10% growth in 1H 2024, compared to Dec 2023, setting the stage for strong revenue growth for the future, not only within human resource services, but in the areas such as IT outsourcing and information services. In 2024 we have obtained two significant patents that further solidify our technological leads in the AI area with wide applications in such verticals as human resources, insurance and wealth management; signed two strategic agreements with publicly traded financial institutions to port our AI LLM technology into wealth management vertical which significantly increases our TAMs (Total Available Markets); and to partner with a leading AI firm publicly traded in the main board of Hong Kong Stock Exchange to develop AI training courses. As a result, we are confident that these initiatives will have positive impacts on both our top and bottom lines going forward. While the macro-economic environment remains uncertain, Lucas’ ordinary shares are currently trading well below our intrinsic valuation. We believe now is the right time to start implementing the repurchase program. And we will continue to buy back shares from time to time in order to maximize our shareholder values.” said Howard Lee, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Lucas.\n\n**About Lucas GC Limited**\n\nWith 18 granted U.S. and Chinese patents and over 74 registered software copyrights in the AI, data analytics and blockchain technologies, Lucas GC Limited is an AI technology-driven Platform as a Service (PaaS) company with over 702,060 agents working on its platform.
