Our goal is to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years.\"\n\n\"We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. Overall, macroeconomic, policy, and geopolitical challenges, and the underlying momentum of the business, were consistent with the last few quarters with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth,\" said Betsy Rafael, Autodesk interim CFO. \"Given Autodesk's sustained momentum in the third quarter, and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, we are raising the midpoints of our billings, revenue, margins, earnings per share, and free cash flow guidance ranges.\"\n\n**Additional Financial Details**\n\n  * Total billings increased 28 percent to $1.54 billion.\n  * Total revenue was $1.57 billion, an increase of 11 percent as reported, and 12 percent on a constant currency basis.

A reconciliation between the fiscal 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP estimates is provided below or in the tables following this press release.\n\n_Fourth_ _Quarter Fiscal 2025_\n\n**Q4 FY25 Guidance Metrics** |  **Q4 FY25****(ending January 31, 2025)**  \n---|---  \nRevenue (in millions) |  $1,623 - $1,638  \nEPS GAAP |  $1.21 - $1.27  \nEPS non-GAAP (1) |  $2.10 - $2.16  \n  \n____________________  \n---  \n(1) Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share excludes $0.85 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.17 for the amortization of both purchased intangibles and developed technologies, and $0.05 for acquisition-related costs, partially offset by ($0.18) related to GAAP-only tax charges.  \n  \n_Full Year Fiscal 2025_\n\n**FY25 Guidance Metrics** |  **FY25****(ending January 31, 2025)**  \n---|---  \nBillings (in millions)  |  $5,900 - $5,980Up 14% - 15%  \nRevenue (in millions) (1) |  $6,115 - $6,130Up approx. 11%  \nGAAP operating margin |  21.5% - 22%  \nNon-GAAP operating margin (2) |  35.5% - 36%  \nEPS GAAP |  $4.95 - $5.01  \nEPS non-GAAP (3) |  $8.29 - $8.35  \nFree cash flow (in millions) (4) |  $1,470 - $1,500  \n  \n____________________  \n---  \n(1) Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and hedge gains/losses, revenue guidance range would be approximately 1 percentage point higher.  \n(2) Non-GAAP operating margin excludes approximately 11% related to stock-based compensation expense, approximately 2% for the amortization of both purchased intangibles and developed technologies, and approximately 1% related to acquisition-related costs.  \n(3) Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share excludes $3.15 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.61 for the amortization of both purchased intangibles and developed technologies, $0.23 related to acquisition-related costs, and $0.04 related to losses on strategic investments, partially offset by ($0.69) related to GAAP-only tax charges.  \n(4) Free cash flow is cash flow from operating activities less approximately $30 million of capital expenditures.  \n  \nThe fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 outlook assume a projected annual effective tax rate of 20 percent and 19 percent for GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. Shifts in geographic profitability continue to impact the annual effective tax rate due to significant differences in tax rates in various jurisdictions. Therefore, assumptions for the annual effective tax rate are evaluated regularly and may change based on the projected geographic mix of earnings.\n\n**Earnings Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nAutodesk will host its third quarter conference call today at 5 p.m. ET.

These metrics are key performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue. These metrics are not intended to be combined with those items. We use these metrics to monitor the strength of our recurring business. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the long-term health of our business. Our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies. The presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Glossary of Terms**\n\n_Billings:_ Total revenue plus the net change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period.\n\n_Cloud Service Offerings_ : Represents individual term-based offerings deployed through web browser technologies or in a hybrid software and cloud configuration. Cloud service offerings that are bundled with other product offerings are not captured as a separate cloud service offering.\n\n_Constant Currency (CC) Growth Rates:_ We attempt to represent the changes in the underlying business operations by eliminating fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as eliminating hedge gains or losses recorded within the current and comparative periods. We calculate constant currency growth rates by (i) applying the applicable prior period exchange rates to current period results and (ii) excluding any gains or losses from foreign currency hedge contracts that are reported in the current and comparative periods.\n\n_Design Business:_ Represents the combination of maintenance, product subscriptions, and all EBAs. Main products include, but are not limited to, AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, Industry Collections, Revit, Inventor, Maya and 3ds Max. Certain products, such as our computer aided manufacturing solutions, incorporate both Design and Make functionality and are classified as Design.\n\n_Enterprise Business Agreements (EBAs):_ Represents programs providing enterprise customers with token-based access to a broad pool of Autodesk products over a defined contract term.\n\n_Flex:_ A pay-as-you-go consumption option to pre-purchase tokens to access any product available with Flex for a daily rate.\n\n_Free Cash Flow:_ Cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures.\n\n_Industry Collections:_ Autodesk Industry Collections are a combination of products and services that target a specific user objective and support a set of workflows for that objective. Our Industry Collections consist of: Autodesk Architecture, Engineering and Construction Collection, Autodesk Product Design and Manufacturing Collection, and Autodesk Media and Entertainment Collection.\n\n_Maintenance Plan:_ Our maintenance plans provide our customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts. Under our maintenance plans, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, and technical support. We recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the agreements, generally one year. \n\n_Make Business:_ Represents certain cloud-based product subscriptions. Main products include, but are not limited to, Assemble, Autodesk Build, BIM Collaborate Pro, BuildingConnected, Fusion, and Flow Production Tracking. Certain products, such as Fusion, incorporate both Design and Make functionality and are classified as Make. \n\n_Net Revenue Retention Rate (NR3):_ Measures the year-over-year change in Recurring Revenue for the population of customers that existed one year ago (\"base customers\"). Net revenue retention rate is calculated by dividing the current quarter Recurring Revenue related to base customers by the total corresponding quarter Recurring Revenue from one year ago. Recurring Revenue is based on USD reported revenue, and fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hedge gains or losses have not been eliminated. Recurring Revenue related to acquired companies, one year after acquisition, has been captured as existing customers until such data conforms to the calculation methodology. This may cause variability in the comparison. \n\n_Other Revenue:_ Consists of revenue from consulting, and other products and services, and is recognized as the products are delivered and services are performed. \n\n_Product Subscription:_ Provides customers a flexible, cost-effective way to access and manage 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software tools. Our product subscriptions currently represent a hybrid of desktop and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. \n\n_Recurring Revenue:_ Consists of the revenue for the period from our traditional maintenance plans, our subscription plan offerings, and certain Other revenue. It excludes subscription revenue related to third-party products. Recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation. \n\n_Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO):_ The sum of total short-term, long-term, and unbilled deferred revenue. Current remaining performance obligations is the amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the next twelve months. \n\n_Solution Provider_ : Solution Provider is the name of our channel partners who primarily serve our new transaction model customers worldwide. Solution Providers may also be resellers in relation to Autodesk solutions.\n\n_Spend_ : The sum of cost of revenue and operating expenses.\n\n_Subscription Plan:_ Comprises our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and EBAs. Subscriptions represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. With subscription, customers can use our software anytime, anywhere, and get access to the latest updates to previous versions. \n\n_Subscription Revenue:_ Includes our cloud-enabled term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible EBAs. \n\n_Unbilled Deferred Revenue:_ Unbilled deferred revenue represents contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multi-year billing plans for subscription, services, and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not been recognized. Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including quotations from management, statements in the paragraphs under \"Business Outlook\" above statements about our short-term and long-term goals, statements regarding our strategies, market and product positions, performance and results, and all statements that are not historical facts. There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release, including: our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services and to move to platforms and capabilities, exposing us to risks such as limited customer acceptance (both new and existing customers), costs related to product defects, and large expenditures; global economic and political conditions, including changes in monetary and fiscal policy, foreign exchange headwinds, recessionary fears, supply chain disruptions, resulting inflationary pressures and hiring conditions; geopolitical tension and armed conflicts, and extreme weather events; costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments; our ability to successfully implement and expand our transaction model; dependency on international revenue and operations, exposing us to significant international regulatory, economic, intellectual property, collections, currency exchange rate, taxation, political, and other risks, including risks related to the war against Ukraine launched by Russia and our exit from Russia and the current conflict between Israel and Hamas; inability to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results; existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes; fluctuation of our financial results, key metrics and other operating metrics; our transition from up front to annual billings for multi-year contracts; deriving a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of solutions, including our AutoCAD-based software products and collections; any failure to successfully execute and manage initiatives to realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives, including our new transaction model for Flex; net revenue, billings, earnings, cash flow, or new or existing subscriptions shortfalls; social and ethical issues relating to the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings; our ability to maintain security levels and service performance meeting the expectations of our customers, and the resources and costs required to avoid unanticipated downtime and prevent, detect and remediate performance degradation and security breaches; security incidents or other incidents compromising the integrity of our or our customers' offerings, services, data, or intellectual property; reliance on third parties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services as well as software; our highly complex software, which may contain undetected errors, defects, or vulnerabilities; increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws; governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls; protection of our intellectual property rights and intellectual property infringement claims from others; the government procurement process; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; our debt service obligations; and our investment portfolio consisting of a variety of investment vehicles that are subject to interest rate trends, market volatility, and other economic factors. Our estimates as to tax rate are based on current interpretations of existing tax law and could be affected by changing interpretations, further guidance, and additional tax legislation.\n\nFurther information on potential factors that could affect the financial results of Autodesk are included in Autodesk's Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q, which are on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

the quarter ended April 30, 2024, the Company changed its presentation of the amortization of costs capitalized to obtain a contract with a customer in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Amortization of costs capitalized to obtain a contract with a customer were previously presented in \"Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of business combinations\" and are now presented in \"Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities.\" Accordingly, prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications did not impact total net cash provided by operating activities. The effect of the change on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was $97 million.  \n  \n**Autodesk, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures**  \n_(In millions, except per share data)_  \nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures including non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP diluted net income per share, and free cash flow. For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, we use non-GAAP measures to supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our future reported financial results. We use non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. For the reasons set forth below, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. This allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. We also use some of these measures for purposes of determining company-wide incentive compensation.  \nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included in this presentation, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.  \nThe following table shows Autodesk's GAAP results reconciled to non-GAAP results included in this release.  \n**Three Months Ended October 31,** |  **Nine Months Ended October 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** |  **(Unaudited)**  \nGAAP operating margin |  22 % |  24 % |  22 % |  20 %  \nStock-based compensation expense |  12 % |  13 % |  11 % |  13 %  \nAmortization of developed technologies |  1 % |  1 % |  1 % |  1 %  \nAmortization of purchased intangibles |  1 % |  1 % |  1 % |  1 %  \nAcquisition-related costs |  1 % |  1 % |  1 % |  — %  \nNon-GAAP operating margin (1) |  36 % |  39 % |  36 % |  36 %  \nGAAP income from operations |  $ 346 |  $ 334 |  $ 988 |  $ 813  \nStock-based compensation expense |  181 |  181 |  500 |  543  \nAmortization of developed technologies |  22 |  11 |  59 |  31  \nAmortization of purchased intangibles |  13 |  10 |  37 |  30  \nAcquisition-related costs |  11 |  11 |  39 |  16  \nLease-related asset impairments and other charges |  — |  — |  — |  7  \nNon-GAAP income from operations |  $ 573 |  $ 547 |  $ 1,623 |  $ 1,440  \nGAAP diluted net income per share |  $ 1.27 |  $ 1.12 |  $ 3.73 |  $ 2.89  \nStock-based compensation expense |  0.83 |  0.84 |  2.30 |  2.52  \nAmortization of developed technologies |  0.10 |  0.05 |  0.27 |  0.14  \nAmortization of purchased intangibles |  0.06 |  0.05 |  0.17 |  0.14  \nAcquisition-related costs |  0.05 |  0.05 |  0.18 |  0.07  \nLease-related asset impairments and other charges |  — |  — |  — |  0.03  \nLoss on strategic investments and dispositions, net |  0.01 |  0.05 |  0.04 |  0.12  \nEstablishment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets |  — |  — |  0.02 |  —  \nDiscrete GAAP tax items |  0.04 |  0.03 |  (0.02) |  (0.08)  \nIncome tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments |  (0.19) |  (0.12) |  (0.51) |  (0.32)  \nNon-GAAP diluted net income per share |  $ 2.17 |  $ 2.07 |  $ 6.18 |  $ 5.51  \nNet cash provided by operating activities |  $ 209 |  $ 18 |  $ 915 |  $ 876  \nCapital expenditures |  (10) |  (5) |  (26) |  (21)  \nFree cash flow |  $ 199 |  $ 13 |  $ 889 |  $ 855  \n  \n____________________  \n---  \n(1) Totals may not sum due to rounding.  \n  \n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=SF66032&sd=2024-11-26) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/autodesk-inc-announces-fiscal-2025-third-quarter-results-302316794.html>\n\nSOURCE Autodesk, Inc.\n\nInvestors: Simon Mays-Smith, 415-746-0137, simon.mays-smith@autodesk.com; Press: Renée Francis, 628-888-4599, renee.francis@autodesk.com\n\n### Social Nav\n\n  * ##### FOLLOW AUTODESK\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/autodesk)\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/autodesk)\n  * [Autodesk Twitter](https://twitter.com/autodesk)\n  * [IR Twitter](https://twitter.com/AutodeskIR)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/autodesk)\n  * [All social media](https://www.autodesk.com/social-media)\n  * [Worldwide sites](https://www.autodesk.com/site-selector)\n\n\n\n### Legal Nav\n\n[Privacy settings](javascript:;) | [Privacy/Cookies](https://www.autodesk.com/company/legal-notices-trademarks/privacy-statement) | [About our Ads](https://www.autodesk.com/company/legal-notices-trademarks/privacy-statement/autodesk-privacy-statement-2015-english#mixpanel) | [Legal](https://www.autodesk.com/company/legal-notices-trademarks) | [Report Noncompliance](https://www.autodesk.com/genuine/report-piracy) | [Site map](https://www.autodesk.com/sitemap) | © 2024 Autodesk, Inc.

He recently was CFO of Elastic since 2017 and assumed the additional responsibilities of COO in 2022. Prior to Elastic, he served in executive and leadership roles at Infoblox, VMware, Cisco, PTC, and Goldman Sachs.

There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release, including: our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services and to move to platforms and capabilities, exposing us to risks such as limited customer acceptance (both new and existing customers), costs related to product defects, and large expenditures; global economic and political conditions, including changes in monetary and fiscal policy, foreign exchange headwinds, recessionary fears, supply chain disruptions, resulting inflationary pressures and hiring conditions; geopolitical tension and armed conflicts, and extreme weather events; costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments; our ability to successfully implement and expand our transaction model; dependency on international revenue and operations, exposing us to significant international regulatory, economic, intellectual property, collections, currency exchange rate, taxation, political, and other risks, including risks related to the war against Ukraine launched by Russia and our exit from Russia and the current conflict between Israel and Hamas; inability to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results; existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes; fluctuation of our financial results, key metrics and other operating metrics; our transition from up front to annual billings for multi-year contracts; deriving a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of solutions, including our AutoCAD-based software products and collections; any failure to successfully execute and manage initiatives to realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives, including our new transaction model for Flex; net revenue, billings, earnings, cash flow, or new or existing subscriptions shortfalls; social and ethical issues relating to the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings; our ability to maintain security levels and service performance meeting the expectations of our customers, and the resources and costs required to avoid unanticipated downtime and prevent, detect and remediate performance degradation and security breaches; security incidents or other incidents compromising the integrity of our or our customers' offerings, services, data, or intellectual property; reliance on third parties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services as well as software; our highly complex software, which may contain undetected errors, defects, or vulnerabilities; increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws; governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls; protection of our intellectual property rights and intellectual property infringement claims from others; the government procurement process; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; our debt service obligations; and our investment portfolio consisting of a variety of investment vehicles that are subject to interest rate trends, market volatility, and other economic factors.\n\nFurther information on potential factors that could affect the financial results of Autodesk are included in Autodesk's Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q, which are on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
