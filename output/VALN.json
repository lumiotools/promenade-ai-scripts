According to the BMJ article, chikungunya could significantly impact local health systems due to its unpredictable and explosive nature.\n\n**Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Valneva** , said, “Understanding the global burden of chikungunya is critical for informing decision makers and designing effective prevention and control strategies. This landmark analysis is very informative as it provides a comprehensive overview of the chikungunya burden worldwide and until now, estimates of chikungunya’s economic and health impact were limited and potentially underestimated. Due to climate change, mosquito-borne diseases have become a year-round menace and continue spreading, increasing the potential for outbreaks.”\n\nAccording to the article, a total of 18.7 million chikungunya cases were reported in 110 countries between 2011 and 2020, causing 1.95 million disability-adjusted life years (DALY)[[1]](#_ftn1) lost. Long-term chronic illness was the source of most costs and DALYs lost. The total economic burden caused by chikungunya over these ten years was estimated at $2.8 billion in direct costs and $47.1 billion in indirect costs worldwide, primarily in Latin American and the Caribbean.\n\n**About Chikungunya** Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes which causes fever, severe joint and muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.[[2]](#_ftn2)\n\nIn 2004, the disease began to spread quickly, causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus, CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.[[3]](#_ftn3) Between 2013 and 2023, more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas[[4]](#_ftn4) and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such, the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.[[5]](#_ftn5)\n\n**About Valneva SE** We are a specialty vaccine company that develops, manufactures, and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

The results are in line with Valneva’s expectations for this vaccine, confirming a strong and long-lasting antibody persistence across all age groups investigated. The three-year persistence data are also in line with positive twelve-month and two-year persistence data the Company reported in December 2022[[1]](#_ftn1) and 2023[[2]](#_ftn2), respectively.\n\nAmong the 278 healthy adults still enrolled in the trial, 96% maintained neutralizing antibody titers well above the seroresponse threshold[[3]](#_ftn3) three years after the single-dose vaccination. Persistence of antibodies in older adults (age 65+) in terms of geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroresponse rates (SRRs) was comparable to younger adults (18-64 years of age). Hence, the primary endpoint was met.\n\nStudy VLA1553-303, which has received funding support from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the European Union’s (EU) Horizon Europe program, also collected long-term safety data by following any ongoing Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) from the preceding study and collecting new-onset Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). The latest analysis does not include a further safety evaluation since safety data collection was concluded at two years after vaccination according to the Clinical Trial Protocol. No safety concerns were reported or identified during the two-year follow-up and no AESI were ongoing at the time of participant enrollment in the trial.\n\n**Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D., Chief Medical Officer** of Valneva, said, “We are extremely pleased about these three-year data which further highlight IXCHIQ®‘s differentiated product profile and ability to induce a robust, long-lasting antibody response in both younger and older adults with a single vaccination. Whether you’re a traveler or live in an endemic region, the potential for long-term protection against a mosquito-borne disease with a single dose is crucial, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where vaccine access is often limited.”\n\nIXCHIQ® is the world’s first and only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. The vaccine is currently approved in the U.S.[[4]](#_ftn4), Europe[[5]](#_ftn5), and Canada[[6]](#_ftn6) for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. Valneva recently submitted label extensions applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)[[7]](#_ftn7), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Health Canada[[8]](#_ftn8) to potentially extend the use of its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ® to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. In addition to the adolescent data, the U.S. and Canadian label extension applications included IXCHIQ®’s two-year antibody persistence data for potential addition to the product label. These persistence data were already included in the initial EMA filing.\n\nThe vaccine was launched in the U.S. at the beginning of March 2024, following adoption of the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)’s recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and launches in France and Canada are currently underway.\n\nIn addition to ramping up sales, Valneva is focused on expanding the vaccine’s label and access. The Company expects a marketing authorization in Brazil before the end of the year and expanded its partnership with CEPI earlier this year[[9]](#_ftn9) to support broader access to the vaccine in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) including outbreak-affected countries, post-marketing trials and potential label extensions in children and adolescents. CEPI is providing Valneva up to $41.3 million of additional funding over the next five years, with support from the EU’s Horizon Europe program.\n\n**About Chikungunya** Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes which causes fever, severe joint and muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.[[10]](#_ftn10)\n\nIn 2004, the disease began to spread quickly, causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus, CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.[[11]](#_ftn11) Between 2013 and 2023, more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas[[12]](#_ftn12) and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically.

The application also includes adding the two-year antibody persistence data to the product label, which is a key differentiator for IXCHIQ®. This FDA application follows the submission of label extension applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Health Canada two months ago [[1]](#_ftn1).\n\nThese label extension applications are based on positive adolescent Phase 3 data, which the Company reported in May 2024 [[2]](#_ftn2). These data showed that a single-dose vaccination with IXCHIQ® induces a high and sustained immune response in 99.1% of adolescents, and that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. _The Lancet Infectious Diseases,_ a world leading infectious diseases journal, also recently published [an article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\\(24\\)00458-4/abstract) showing that the vaccine was well tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 28 days after a single injection, regardless of previous CHIKV infection.\n\nIn addition to the adolescent data, the U.S. and Canadian label extension applications included IXCHIQ®’s long-term antibody persistence data, which showed that the vaccine’s immune response was sustained by 97% of participants after 24 months and was equally durable in younger and older adults [[3]](#_ftn3). These persistence data were already included in the initial EMA filing. The Company expects to publish 36-month persistence data in the coming weeks.\n\n**Juan Carlos Jaramillo, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Valneva** , commented, “Given the substantial risk that chikungunya presents to individuals residing in or traveling to endemic regions, it’s imperative to ensure the vaccine is available to all age groups. This broader accessibility would certainly help provide protection and mitigate the burden of this debilitating illness which is currently spreading in areas that were previously unaffected. The long-term durability of the immune response from a single shot is also extremely important, especially for endemic countries where access to immunization can be difficult.”\n\nIXCHIQ® is the world’s first and only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this significant unmet medical need. The vaccine is currently approved in the U.S.[[4]](#_ftn4), Europe [[5]](#_ftn5), and Canada[[6]](#_ftn6) for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. It was launched in the U.S. at the beginning of March 2024, following adoption of the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)’s recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and launches in France and Canada are underway.\n\nIn addition to ramping up sales, Valneva is focused on expanding the vaccine’s label and access. The Company expects a marketing authorization in Brazil before the end of the year and expanded its partnership with The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) earlier this year[[7]](#_ftn7) to support broader access to the vaccine in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), post-marketing trials and potential label extensions in children, adolescents and pregnant women. CEPI will provide Valneva up to $41.3 million of additional funding over the next five years, with support from the European Union’s (EU) Horizon Europe program.\n\n**About Chikungunya** Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes which causes fever, severe joint and muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.[[8]](#_ftn8)\n\nIn 2004, the disease began to spread quickly, causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus, CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.[[9]](#_ftn9) Between 2013 and 2023, more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas[[10]](#_ftn10) and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such, the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.[[11]](#_ftn11)\n\n**About Valneva SE**\n\nWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops, manufactures, and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.
