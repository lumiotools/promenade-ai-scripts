All statements, other than statements of historical fact in this\npresentation and the oral statements made in connection therewith regarding AST SpaceMobile, Inc.’s, collectively with its subsidiaries (“SpaceMobile” or the “Company”), financial position,\nbusiness strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “seek,”\n“plan,” “predict,” “potential,” and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a\nstatement is not forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management’s current beliefs, based on information currently\navailable. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For\ninformation identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Risk\nFactors contained in AST SpaceMobile’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The Company’s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC’s\nwebsite at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether\nas a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted operating expense is an alternative financial measure used by management to evaluate our operating performance as a supplement to our most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial\nmeasure. We define Adjusted operating expense as total operating expenses adjusted to exclude amounts of stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expense. We\nbelieve Adjusted operating expenses is a useful measure across time in evaluating the Company's operating performance as we use Adjusted operating expenses to manage the business, including\nin preparing our annual operating budget and financial projections. Adjusted operating expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and\ntherefore has limits in its usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definition, it may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are\npresented solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for\nits most directly comparable GAAP measure of total operating expenses.\nIndustry and Market Data\nThis presentation includes market data and other statistical information from sources believed to be reliable, including independent industry publications, governmental publications or other\npublished independent sources. Although AST SpaceMobile believes these sources are reliable, we have not independently verified the information and cannot guarantee its accuracy and\ncompleteness.\nTrademarks and Trade Names\nAST SpaceMobile owns or has rights to various trademarks, service marks and trade names that they use in connection with the operation of their respective businesses.

Adjusted operating expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and\ntherefore has limits in its usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definition, it may not be comparable to thecalculation of similar measures of other companies and are\npresented solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Thismeasure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for\nits most directly comparable GAAP measure of Total operating expenses.\nIndustry and Market Data\nThis presentation includes market data and other statistical information from sources believed to be reliable, including independent industry publications, governmental publications or other\npublished independent sources.

We have\nadditional liquidity of $51.5 million in gross proceeds available to draw under the Senior Secured Credit\nFacility, subject to certain conditions and approvals\n• Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $63.9 million, including $29.3 million of\ndepreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. This represents an increase of\n$7.9 million as compared to $56.0 million in the first quarter of 2024, due to a $5.6 million increase in\ngeneral and administrative costs, a $1.7 million increase in engineering services costs, a $0.4 million\nincrease in depreciation and amortization expense, and a $0.2 million increase in research and\ndevelopment costs\n• Total Adjusted operating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $34.6 million, an increase of\n$3.5 million as compared to $31.1 million in the first quarter of 2024, due to a $2.0 million increase in\nAdjusted general and administrative costs, a $1.3 million increase in Adjusted engineering services\ncosts and a $0.2 million increase in research and development costs(1)\n• As of June 30, 2024, we have incurred approximately $347.5 million of gross capitalized property and\nequipment costs and accumulated depreciation and amortization of $99.3 million. The capitalized\ncosts include costs of satellite materials for BlueBird satellites, advance launch payments, BlueWalker\n3 satellite, assembly and integration facilities including assembly and test equipment, and ground\nantennas\n(1) See reconciliation of Adjusted operating expenses to Total operating expenses, Adjusted engineering services costs to Engineering services\ncosts and Adjusted general and administrative costs to General and administrative costs in the tables accompanying this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including Adjusted operating expenses,\nAdjusted engineering services costs and Adjusted general and administrative costs. We believe these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are useful measures across time in evaluating our operating performance as we use these\nmeasures to manage the business, including in preparing our annual operating budget and financial projections.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and therefore\nhave limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, these measures may\nnot be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented solely to provide\ninvestors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance. These\nmeasures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for their most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are\nincluded in the tables accompanying this press release.\nConference Call Information\nAST SpaceMobile will hold a quarterly business update conference call at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on\nWednesday, August 14, 2024.

Organization and Nature of Operations\nAST SpaceMobile, Inc., collectively with its subsidiaries (“SpaceMobile” or the “Company”), is currently designing and developing the constellation of\nBlueBird (“BB”) satellites in advance of launching its planned space-based Cellular Broadband network distributed through a constellation of Low Earth\nOrbit (“LEO”) satellites. Once deployed and operational, the BB satellites are designed to provide connectivity directly to off-the-shelf and unmodified\ndevices at broadband speeds (the “SpaceMobile Service”). At that point, the Company intends to offer the SpaceMobile Service to cellular subscribers and\nothers through wholesale commercial agreements with cellular service providers. The Company is headquartered in Texas where it operates 185,000 square\nfeet satellite assembly, integrating and testing (“AIT”) facilities. The Company’s intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio is diverse, containing numerous and\nvarious innovations of the direct-to-cell satellite ecosystem from space to Earth. The Company’s IP portfolio consists of 36 patent families worldwide. As\nof June 30, 2024, the Company has more than 3,400 patent and patent pending claims worldwide, of which approximately 1,240 have been officially\ngranted or allowed.\nThe Company launched its BlueWalker 3 (“BW3”) test satellite on September 10, 2022, and announced the completion of the deployment of the\ncommunication phased array antenna of the BW3 test satellite in orbit on November 14, 2022. On April 25, 2023, the Company announced that it had\nsuccessfully completed two-way voice calls directly to standard unmodified smartphones using the BW3 test satellite. On June 21, 2023, the Company\nannounced that it had achieved repeated successful 4G download speeds of above 10 megabits per second (“Mbps”) to standard unmodified smartphones\nusing the BW3 test satellite. On September 19, 2023, the Company announced it had achieved repeated successful two-way voice calls directly to standard\nunmodified smartphones using 5G connectivity and successful download speeds of approximately 14 Mbps utilizing 5 megahertz (“Mhz”) of low band\nspectrum via the BW3 test satellite. The Company intends to continue testing capabilities of the BW3 test satellite, including further testing with cellular\nservice providers and devices.\nOn April 6, 2021, the Company completed a business combination (the “Business Combination”) with AST & Science, LLC (“AST LLC”). Following the\nconsummation of the Business Combination, the combined company was organized in an “Up-C” structure in which the business is operated by AST LLC\nand its subsidiaries and in which the Company's only direct assets consist of equity interests in AST LLC. As the managing member of AST LLC, the\nCompany has full discretion to manage and control the business of AST LLC and to take all action it deems necessary to accomplish the purposes of AST\nLLC. The Company’s Class A Common Stock and publicly issued warrants (“Public Warrants”) are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols\n“ASTS” and “ASTSW”, respectively.\nThe Company operates from multiple locations that include its corporate headquarters and 185,000 square feet AIT facilities in Texas where the final AIT\nis performed, and engineering and development centers elsewhere in the United States, and in India, Scotland, Spain, and Israel.\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified\nby the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and the Company may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting\nrequirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to\ncomply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in the Company's periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on\nexecutive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared by the Company in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, AST LLC, and its subsidiaries. Intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period\npresentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contain all adjustments\n6\n(consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly state the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe financial statements of AST LLC and its subsidiaries have been prepared on a consolidated basis with the Company as the Company is the sole\nmanaging member of AST LLC and has full discretion to manage and control the business of AST LLC and to take all action it deems necessary to\naccomplish the purposes of AST LLC.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with\nthe SEC on April 1, 2024 (the “2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”). The results of operations for the periods presented are not indicative of the results to\nbe expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any other interim period or other future year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on\nhistorical experience when available and on other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions reflected in these financial statements include, but are not limited to, useful lives assigned to property and\nequipment, the fair values of warrant liabilities, potential impairment of long-lived assets, and equity-based compensation expense. The Company assesses\nestimates on an ongoing basis; however, actual results could materially differ from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including the continued\nuncertainty surrounding rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to geopolitical conflicts, and macroeconomic conditions including changes\nin inflation and interest rates.\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K, and there have been no significant changes in these significant accounting policies as compared to those described therein.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue generated from sales of goods and services is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in accordance with ASC\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The Company recognizes revenue for services provided over time as customers simultaneously\nreceive and consume the benefits provided by the Company’s performance. For performance obligations that do not meet the criteria for over time\nrecognition, the Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of the performance obligation to the customer. The Company defers revenue and\nrecognizes contract liabilities in the event the performance obligations are not satisfied for which compensation has been received.\nTo date, the Company has not generated any revenues from its SpaceMobile Service or from the resale of gateway equipment and associated services to\nmobile network operators and other third parties. During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized $0.9 million and\n$1.4 million of revenue from performance obligations completed to date under an agreement with a prime contractor for a U.S. Government contract.\nAs of June 30, 2024, $21.8 million of contract liabilities were recorded for advance payments received but associated performance obligations not yet\nsatisfied related to the Company’s SpaceMobile Service and resale of gateway equipment and associated services to customers. There were no contract\nliabilities or contract assets as of December 31, 2023.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, that requires a\npublic entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures\nabout a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. It requires a public entity to also disclose the title and position of\nthe Chief Operating Decision Maker. A public entity should apply the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial\nstatements. The ASU was effective for the Company on January 1, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025. The adoption\nof this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n7\nFuture Adoption of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 requires a public\nbusiness entity (PBE) to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified\ncategories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all\nentities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the\namount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. The ASU is effective for the Company on January 1, 2025. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nAll other new accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective or adopted, have been deemed to be not relevant to the Company and, accordingly,\nare not expected to have a material impact once adopted.\n3. Fair Value Measurement\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in thousands):\nAs of June 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents $ 259,430 $ - $ -\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 259,430 $ - $ -\nLiabilities:\nPublic warrant liability $ 53,598 $ - $ -\nPrivate placement warrant liability - 24,288 -\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 53,598 $ 24,288 $ -\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents $ 69,661 $ - $ -\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 69,661 $ - $ -\nLiabilities:\nPublic warrant liability $ 18,707 $ - $ -\nPrivate placement warrant liability - 11,253 -\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 18,707 $ 11,253 $ -\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $287.6 million and $88.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash,\nrespectively, of which $259.4 million and $69.7 million, respectively, is classified as cash equivalents, which consists principally of short-term money\nmarket funds with original maturities of 90 days or less. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, restricted cash of $2.5 million represents a deposit\ninto an interest reserve escrow account for the senior secured credit facility, and a deposit against the bank guaranty issued to the landlord for lease of a\nproperty. For certain instruments, including cash, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, it was estimated that the carrying amount approximated fair\nvalue because of the short maturities of these instruments.\nWarrant liabilities are comprised of both Public Warrants and private placement warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”), exercisable for shares of Class A\nCommon Stock. Warrant liabilities are described in detail at Note 6: Warrant Liabilities. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Public Warrants\nare classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market under the ticker “ASTSW”.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes-Merton Model. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Private Placement\nWarrants are classified as Level 2 as the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone outside of a small group of individuals who are permitted\ntransferees would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants. For this reason, the Company\ndetermined that the volatility of each Private Placement Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant.\n8\nThe Company’s Black-Scholes-Merton model to value Private Placement Warrants required the use of the following subjective assumption inputs:\n• As of June 30, 2024, the risk-free rate assumption was based on the one- and two-year U.S. Treasury rates as the estimated time to expire was\n1.77 years compared to an estimated time to expire of 2.26 years as of December 31, 2023 based on the two- and three year U.S. Treasury\nrates. An increase in the risk-free interest rate, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities\nand vice versa.\n• The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility of the Company’s Public Warrants, which as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 was 78.0% and 80.4%, respectively.\n4. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\n\u0003 \u0003 As of\n\u0003 \u0003 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLand $ 1,350 $ 1,350\nBuildings 15,208 14,555\nLeasehold improvements 9,071 9,111\nSatellite in orbit 92,464 92,464\nLab, assembly, and integration equipment 37,317 31,957\nSatellite antenna 7,219 7,188\nComputer hardware and software 14,434 11,112\nOther \u0003 1,395 \u0003 1,230\nConstruction in progress\nSatellite materials, satellites under construction, and advance launch payments 164,436 125,428\nOther 4,596 5,256\nTotal property and equipment, gross $ 347,490 $ 299,651\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (99,328) (61,173)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 248,162 $ 238,478\nDepreciation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $40.3 million and $15.8 million, respectively. Depreciation\nexpense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $20.4 million and $14.1 million, respectively.\n5. Long-Term Debt\nLong-term debt consists of the following, (in thousands):\n\u0003 \u0003 As of\nJune 30, 2024 \u0003 December 31, 2023\nConvertible notes $ 147,959 \u0003 $ -\nSenior secured credit facility(1) 52,023 \u0003 52,023\nCapital equipment loan 15,000 \u0003 15,000\nTerm loan 4,634 4,758\nTotal debt $ 219,616 $ 71,781\nLess: current portion of long-term debt (258) (252)\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs(1) (19,812) (12,277)\nLong-term debt, net of issuance costs $ 199,546 $ 59,252\n(1) Includes estimated exit fee of $3.5 million due at maturity.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the aggregate fair value of the Company’s debt was $379.0 million, which included the fair value of the Company’s convertible notes\nof $310.8 million. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of the Company’s debt was $68.7 million. The fair value of the convertible notes has\nbeen determined based on a lattice-based binomial model using significant inputs derived from,\n9\nor corroborated by, observable market data (Level 2 inputs). The fair value of remaining debt has been determined under the discounted cash flow method\nusing significant inputs derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data (Level 2 inputs).\nDebt issuance costs are comprised of costs incurred in connection with debt issuance and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a deduction to\nthe carrying amount of the debt and amortized using the effective interest method to interest expense over the term of the debt. During the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized $4.9 million and $9.3 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the debt noted above. The\ninterest expense included amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.0 million and $1.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,\nrespectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $0.1 million in interest expense in each period.\nInterest expense is included in interest (expense) income, net in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants requirements.\nConvertible Notes\nPursuant to the Convertible Security Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) which the Company entered into with certain investors, the\nCompany issued subordinated convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”) for an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million on January 16, 2024 to\nAT&T Venture Investments, LLC (“AT&T”), Google LLC (“Google”) and Vodafone Ventures Limited (“Vodafone”), and for an aggregate principal\namount of $35.0 million on May 23, 2024 to Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”). The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $9.3 million upon\nclosing of the Convertible Notes. As of June 30, 2024, $4.3 million of debt issuance cost remains due and is included in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, beginning on\nJune 30, 2024. The Company has the option to pay interest on the Convertible Notes in cash or in kind. The Company has elected to pay interest on the\nConvertible Notes in kind on June 30, 2024, resulting in the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being increased by approximately $3.0 million.\nInterest will accrue on such increased principal amount in subsequent interest periods. The AT&T, Google and Vodafone Convertible Notes have a 10-year\nterm unless earlier converted and the Verizon Convertible Notes have a 9 years and 9 months term unless earlier converted.\nThe holders of the Convertible Notes (the “Holders”) may convert the Convertible Notes (subject to certain exceptions) at an initial conversion rate of\n173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $5.75 per share\nof Class A Common Stock). The Holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option at any time 12 months after date of issuance (“Conversion\nDate”), which is on or after January 16, 2025. The Holders will also have the right to convert the Convertible Notes prior to the Conversion Date in the\nevent that the Company undergoes a fundamental change (defined to include change of control, certain mergers of the Company with another company, the\nsale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, and liquidation). The conversion rate is also subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments if\ncertain events occur.\nOn or after the Conversion Date, the Company may require the Holders to convert the Convertible Notes (subject to certain exceptions), at an initial\nconversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price\nof $5.75 per share of Class A Common Stock) at its option, if the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then\nin effect for 30 consecutive trading days, on the immediately succeeding trading day after the last trading day of such 30 day period.\nThe Convertible Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default and fundamental change. In the case of an event of default with\nrespect to the Convertible Notes arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, 100% of the principal of, and accrued and\nunpaid interest on, the Convertible Notes will automatically become due and payable. If any other event of default with respect to the Convertible Notes\noccurs or is continuing (which include customary events of default, including the failure to pay principal or interest when due and the failure to comply\nwith other covenants contained in the Investment Agreement), the Holders of at least 60% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding\nSubordinated Obligations (as defined in the Investment Agreement to include the obligations under the Convertible Notes) may declare the principal\namount of the Convertible Notes to be immediately due and payable. In the case of fundamental change as defined in the Investment Agreement prior to the\nconversion or maturity of the Convertible Notes, the Company is required to repay the Convertible Notes immediately prior to the consummation of such\nfundamental change in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Convertible Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\nOther than as described above, there were no new debt issuances or significant changes related to the above listed debt during the six months ended June\n30, 2024. See Note 8: Debt to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in its 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation regarding the debt listed above.\n10\n6. Warrant Liabilities\nWarrant liabilities are comprised of both Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the registered holder to\npurchase one whole share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a holder of Public Warrants may\nexercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A Common Stock.\nThis means that only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. The Public Warrants expire on April 6, 2026, five years after\nthe Business Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants\nunder the following conditions:\n• In whole and not in part;\n• At a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n• Upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; and\n• If, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a\n30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.\nThe redemption criteria discussed above prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price.\nIf the foregoing conditions are satisfied and the Company issues a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise its\nwarrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A Common Stock may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price (as\nadjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption\nnotice is issued.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and are\nnon-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone\nother than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such\nholders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, no Public Warrants were exercised. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, 1,123,437 Private\nPlacement Warrants were converted to Public Warrants. There were no Private Placement Warrants converted to Public Warrants during the six months\nended June 30, 2023. At June 30, 2024, there were 12,671,037 Public Warrants and 4,926,563 Private Placement Warrants outstanding. At December 31,\n2023, there were 11,547,600 Public Warrants and 6,050,000 Private Placement Warrants outstanding.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded warrant liabilities of $77.9 million and $30.0 million in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a loss of $66.1 million and $47.9\nmillion, respectively, on the change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized a gain of $6.5 million and $14.0 million, respectively, on the change in the fair value\nof the warrant liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n7. Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had contractual commitments with third parties of approximately $100.5 million, primarily related to procurement of\nBB satellite components, R&D programs, capital improvements and future launch payments for Block 2 Bluebird satellite.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully\nadjudicated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss\nin excess of any recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although\nmanagement considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of\n11\nthese legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nDelaware Class Action Litigations\nFollowing books and records demands pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220, two stockholders filed putative class action complaints in the Delaware Court of\nChancery against the Company, certain current and former directors and officers of the Company and its predecessor entity and manager, New Providence\nAcquisition Corp. and New Providence Management LLC, and Abel Avellan, alleging claims of breach of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting such\nbreaches, and unjust enrichment, relating to the de-SPAC merger. The first of those complaints, Taylor v. Coleman, et al. (C.A. No. 2023-1292), was filed\non December 27, 2023, and the second, Drulias v. New Providence Management LLC, et al., was filed on March 29, 2024 (collectively, the “Delaware\nStockholder Class Actions”). On March 15, 2024, prior to the filing of the Drulias action, the defendants had moved to dismiss the Taylor action. On April\n29, 2024, the court entered a stipulation by the parties to both actions to be consolidated under the caption In re AST SpaceMobile, Inc. Stockholders\nLitigation (C.A. No. 2023-1292), and for the plaintiffs to file a consolidated amended complaint by May 29, 2024. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint\non May 29, 2024, which asserts the same claims and seeks the same damages—equitable relief and unspecified monetary damages. On July 15, 2024, the\ndefendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint.\nFederal Class Action Litigations\nThe Company and certain of its current executive officers have been named as defendants in a putative stockholder class action lawsuit pending in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The action is styled Klarkowski v. AST SpaceMobile, Inc., No. 7:24-cv-00102-DC-RCG\n(W.D. Tex.) (the “Securities Class Action”). The complaint in the Securities Class Action, which was filed on April 17, 2024, alleges that defendants\nviolated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and\nmisleading statements and omissions relating to the status and timeline of satellite production, and that the current executive officers named as defendants\nare control persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint is filed on behalf of shareholders who purchased shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock between November 14, 2023 and April 1, 2024 (“Class Period”), and seeks monetary damages on behalf of the purported class. On July 9,\n2024, the Court appointed a Lead Plaintiff for the putative class and approved his choice of Lead Counsel. The deadline for Lead Plaintiff to file his\nconsolidated amended complaint is September 9, 2024, and the deadline for defendants to move to dismiss, answer, or otherwise respond to the\nconsolidated amended complaint is November 8, 2024.\nThe Company has been named as a nominal defendant and certain of its current and former executive officers and directors have been named as defendants\nin a derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The action is styled Hanna v. Avellan, et al., No. 7:24-\ncv-00171-DC-RCG (W.D. Tex.) (the “Derivative Action”). The complaint in the Derivative Action, which was filed on July 23, 2024, asserts claims for\nbreach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and violations of the Exchange Act against all defendants and\nclaims for contribution under the federal securities laws against certain of the defendants. The deadline for the defendants to move to dismiss, answer, or\notherwise respond to the complaint in the Derivative Action is September 30, 2024.\n8. Stockholders’ Equity\nClass A Common Stock\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 148,751,110 shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding. Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to\none vote for each share. The Company is authorized to issue 800,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nClass B Common Stock\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 39,747,447 shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. Shares of Class B Common Stock were issued to\nthen existing equity holders of AST LLC (other than Abel Avellan, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“Mr. Avellan”)) at the time of\nBusiness Combination and are noneconomic, but entitle the holder to one vote per share. The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of Class\nB Common Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nThe existing equity holders of AST LLC (other than Mr. Avellan) at the time of Business Combination own economic interests in AST LLC which are\nredeemable into either shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis or cash at the option of the Redemption Election Committee. Upon\nredemption of the AST LLC Common Units by the existing equity holders (other than Mr. Avellan), a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common\nStock held by such existing equity holders will be cancelled. During the six months\n12\nended June 30, 2024, the existing equity holders redeemed 10,294,310 AST LLC Common Units into Class A Common Stock and subsequently\n10,294,310 Class B Common Stock held by such existing equity holders were cancelled.\nClass C Common Stock\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 78,163,078 shares of Class C Common Stock issued and outstanding. Shares of Class C Common Stock were issued to Mr.\nAvellan in connection with the Business Combination and are non-economic, but entitle the holder to the lesser of 10 votes per share and the Class C Share\nVoting Amount, the latter of which is a number of votes per share equal to (1) (x) an amount of votes equal to 88.3% of the total voting power of the\noutstanding voting stock, minus (y) the total voting power of the outstanding capital stock (other than Class C Common Stock) owned or controlled by Mr.\nAvellan and his permitted transferees, divided by (2) the number of shares of Class C Common Stock then outstanding (the “Super-Voting Rights”). The\nCompany is authorized to issue 125,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nMr. Avellan owns economic interests in AST LLC which are redeemable into either shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis or cash at the\noption of the Redemption Election Committee. Upon redemption of the AST LLC Common Units by Mr. Avellan, a corresponding number of shares of\nClass C Common Stock held by Mr. Avellan will be cancelled. Correspondingly, the Super-Voting Rights associated with the shares of Class C Common\nStock cancelled will be terminated. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, Mr. Avellan did not redeem any AST LLC Common Units.\nPreferred Stock\nAt June 30, 2024 there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock\nwith a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of\nDirectors.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe noncontrolling interests primarily represent the equity interest in AST LLC held by members other than the Company. Changes in the Company’s\nownership interest in AST LLC while retaining control of AST LLC are accounted for as equity transactions. Income or loss is attributed to the\nnoncontrolling interests based on their contractual distribution rights, and the relative percentages of equity interest held by the Company and the other\nmembers during the period.\nAs the sole managing member of AST LLC controlling the operating decisions of AST LLC, the Company consolidates the financial position and results of\noperations of AST LLC and its subsidiaries. The Company reports equity interests in AST LLC held by members other than the Company as\nnoncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling interest is classified as permanent equity within the consolidated balance\nsheets as the Company may only elect to settle a redemption request in cash if the cash delivered in the exchange is limited to the amount of net proceeds\nfrom the issuance and sale of a Class A Common Stock from a new permanent equity offering.\nEach issuance of the Company's Class A Common Stock is accompanied by a corresponding issuance of AST LLC Common Units to the Company, which\nresults in changes in ownership and reduction in noncontrolling interest. As of June 30, 2024, there were 12,671,037 Public Warrants and 4,926,563 Private\nPlacement Warrants outstanding (see Note 6: Warrant Liabilities for further details), each of which entitles the holder to purchase one whole share of Class\nA Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Each warrant exercise is accompanied by a corresponding issuance of AST LLC Common Units to the\nCompany, which results in a change in ownership and reduces the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increases additional paid-in capital.\nIn addition, the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of AST LLC permits the noncontrolling interest holders of\nAST LLC Common Units to exchange AST LLC Common Units, together with related shares of the Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock,\nfor shares of the Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis or, at the election of the Company, for cash (a “Cash Exchange”). A Cash Exchange is\nlimited to the amount of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of Class A Common Stock. Future redemptions or direct exchanges of AST LLC Common\nUnits by the noncontrolling interest holders will result in a change in ownership and reduce the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increase\nadditional paid-in capital. Certain members of AST LLC also hold incentive stock options that are subject to service or performance conditions (see Note 9:\nStock-Based Compensation for further details), that are exercisable for AST LLC Common Units which will simultaneously be redeemed for Class A\nCommon Stock. The exercise of the options results in a change in ownership and decreases the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increases\nadditional paid-in capital.\nThe Company grants service-based and performance-based restricted stock units and service-based options that are exercisable for Class A Common Stock\nunder the 2020 Incentive Award Plan (see Note 9: Stock-Based Compensation for further details). The vesting of the\n13\nrestricted stock units and the exercise of the options result in a change in ownership and decrease the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and\nincrease additional paid-in capital.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the noncontrolling interest in AST LLC was approximately 44.2% and 58.7%, respectively. The decrease in\nnoncontrolling interest percentage during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was a result of the issuance of Class A Common Stock under the January\n2024 Common Stock Offering and the Equity Distribution Agreement, the redemption of AST LLC Common Units in exchange for Class A Common\nStock, the exercise of options for Class A Common Stock, and the vesting of the Company’s restricted stock units.\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreement\nOn May 6, 2022, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement (collectively referred to as the\n“Common Stock Purchase Agreement”) with B. Riley Principal Capital, LLC (“B. Riley”). Pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the\nCompany had the right, in its sole discretion, to sell to B. Riley up to $75.0 million of shares of the Class A Common Stock at 97% of the volume weighted\naverage price (“VWAP”) of the Class A Common Stock calculated in accordance with the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, over a period of 24 months\nsubject to certain limitations and conditions contained in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. Sales and timing of any sales of Class A Common Stock\nwere solely at the election of the Company, and the Company was under no obligation to sell any securities to B. Riley under the Common Stock Purchase\nAgreement.\nUnder the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company had issued 1,756,993 shares of its Class A Common Stock as of December 31, 2023,\naggregating to net proceeds of $13.4 million. The Company did not issue any shares of its Class A Common Stock under the Common Stock Purchase\nAgreement during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Proceeds from the sale of the Class A Common Stock under the Common Stock Purchase\nAgreement were used for general corporate purposes. The Common Stock Purchase Agreement expired on August 1, 2024.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nOn September 8, 2022, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Sales Agreement” or “At The Market Equity Program”) with\nEvercore Group L.L.C. and B. Riley Securities, Inc. (collectively, the “agents”) to sell shares of the Class A Common Stock having an aggregate sale price\nof up to $150.0 million through an “at the market offering” program under which the agents act as sales agents. The sales of the shares made under the\nSales Agreement may be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The agents sell the Class A Common Stock based upon the Company’s instructions (including\nany price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions the Company may impose). Under the Sales Agreement, the agents are entitled to\ntotal compensation at a commission rate of up to 3.0% of the gross sales price per share sold.\nUnder the Sales Agreement, the Company had issued 4,225,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock as of December 31, 2023, aggregating to proceeds of\n$27.2 million, net of commissions paid to the agents and transaction costs. The Company issued an additional 9,725,157 shares of its Class A Common\nStock (including 653,903 shares settled on July 1, 2024) under the Sales Agreement during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and received\nproceeds of $79.4 million, net of commissions paid to the agents and transaction costs for the shares settled during the three and six months ended June 30,\n2024. Proceeds from the sale of the Class A Common Stock under the Sales Agreement were and are expected to continue to be used for general corporate\npurposes.\nJanuary 2024 Common Stock Offering\nOn January 23, 2024, the Company issued 32,258,064 shares of Class A Common Stock in a public offering and received proceeds of $93.6 million, net of\nunderwriting commissions of $6.0 million and transaction costs of $0.4 million. The Company provided a 30-day option to the underwriting agent to\npurchase up to an additional 4,838,709 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Option Shares”) from us on the same terms and conditions. On January 25,\n2024, the Option Shares were exercised in full. The offering of the Option Shares closed on January 29, 2024 for proceeds of $14.1 million, net of\nunderwriting commissions of $0.9 million. Proceeds from the sale of our Class A Common Stock under the January 2024 Common Stock Offering were\nused for general corporate purposes.\n14\n9. Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation, measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, is typically recognized ratably over the requisite services\nperiod, using the straight-line method of expense attribution. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in the following categories of its\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\n\u0003 \u0003 For the Three Months Ended June 30, For the Six Months Ended June 30,\n\u0003 \u0003 2024 2023 2024 2023\nEngineering services costs $ 2,032 $ 4,458 $ 3,639 $ 5,850\nGeneral and administrative costs 6,842 1,074 10,168 2,156\nTotal $ 8,874 $ 5,532 $ 13,807 $ 8,006\nThe Company estimates the fair value of the stock option awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which\nrequires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected volatility of the Company's stock, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-\nfree interest rate, and (iv) any expected dividends. Due to the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company based the\nestimate of expected volatility on the estimated and expected volatilities of a representative group of publicly traded companies. For these analyses, the\nCompany selects companies with comparable characteristics including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share\nprice information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The Company computes the historical volatility data using the daily\nclosing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. The Company will\ncontinue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of the Company’s stock price becomes available.\nFor awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options, the Company estimates the expected life of the employee stock options using the “simplified” method,\nwhereby the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The expected term of stock options granted\nto non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve\nin effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the\nfact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company elects to\naccount for forfeitures as they occur rather than apply an estimated forfeiture rate to stock-based compensation expense.\nThe fair value of restricted stock units granted to employees, non-employees, and non-employee members of the Board of Directors is based on the fair\nvalue of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The Company elects to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than apply an estimated forfeiture rate to\nstock-based compensation expense.\nAST LLC 2019 Equity Incentive Plan\nPrior to the Business Combination, under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“AST LLC Incentive Plan”), AST LLC was authorized to issue ordinary shares,\nas well as options exercisable for ordinary shares, as incentives to its employees, non-employees, and non-employee members of its Board of Directors.\nFollowing the Business Combination, no further grants were made or will be made under the AST LLC Incentive Plan. In connection with the Business\nCombination, the existing AST LLC options were reclassified into options to acquire AST LLC Incentive Equity Units, and there was no incremental\ncompensation cost and the terms of the outstanding awards, including fair value, vesting conditions and classification, were unchanged. Each AST LLC\nIncentive Equity Unit is convertible into one AST LLC Common Unit and each AST LLC Common Unit is redeemable for one share of Class A Common\nStock on the later of the (i) 24-month anniversary of the consummation of the Business Combination and (ii) six-month anniversary from the vesting date.\nThe AST LLC Incentive Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted under it, except that in lieu of ordinary\nshares, holders of options under the AST LLC Incentive Plan have the right to exercise for AST LLC Incentive Units, which may then be converted into\nAST LLC Common Units, which may further be converted into shares of the Class A Common Stock.\nThere were two types of options granted under the AST LLC Incentive Plan: (1) service-based options and (2) performance-based options. Service-based\noptions typically vest over a five year service period with 20% of the award vesting on the first anniversary of the employee’s commencement date, and the\nbalance thereafter in 48 equal monthly installments. Certain service-based options also provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control or\nother performance condition as defined by the AST LLC Incentive Plan. Performance-based options typically vest on the earliest date that any of the\nfollowing occurs: (i) AST LLC effects an initial public offering and becomes a reporting company, (ii) AST LLC experiences a change of control, or (iii)\nother specified performance conditions. Both service-based and performance-based options typically expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.\n15\nAs of June 30, 2024, AST LLC was authorized to issue a total of 12,812,959 Incentive Equity Units under a reserve set aside for equity awards. As of June\n30, 2024, there were options to acquire 7,103,410 Incentive Equity Units outstanding under the AST LLC Incentive Plan.\nThe following table summarizes AST LLC’s option activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted-Average\nRemaining\nWeighted-Average Contractual Term\nOptions Exercise Price (years)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 7,770,421 $ 1.11 5.76\nGranted - -\nExercised (652,388) 0.11\nCancelled or forfeited (14,623) 7.67\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 7,103,410 $ 1.18 5.26\nOptions exercisable as of June 30, 2024 5,974,864 $ 1.07 5.17\nVested and expected to vest at June 30, 2024 6,231,544 $ 1.29 5.21\nThe following table summarizes the AST LLC’s unvested option activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted-Average Grant\nNumber of Shares Date Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 1,809,555 $ 0.80\nGranted - -\nVested (666,386) 7.63\nForfeited (14,623) 3.20\nUnvested at June 30, 2024 1,128,546 $ 0.81\nThere were no stock options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested stock options was $0.7 million, which is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted average period of 1.10 years.\nSpaceMobile 2020 Incentive Award Plan\nIn connection with the Business Combination, the Company adopted the 2020 Incentive Award Plan (the “2020 Plan”). Awards may be made under the\n2020 Plan covering an aggregate number of Class A Common Stock shares equal to 10,800,000. Any shares distributed pursuant to an award may consist,\nin whole or in part, of authorized and unissued common stock, treasury common stock or common stock purchased on the open market. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, restricted stock units, incentive unit awards, stock appreciation rights, and\nother stock or cash-based awards. Each incentive unit issued pursuant to an award, if any, shall count as one share for purposes of calculating the aggregate\nnumber of shares available for issuance under the 2020 Plan.\nTwo types of equity awards have been granted under the 2020 Plan: (1) service-based options and (2) service-based and performance-based restricted stock\nunits. Service-based options typically vest over a four year service period with 25% of the award vesting on the first anniversary of the employee’s\ncommencement date, and the balance thereafter in 36 equal monthly installments. Service-based restricted stock units typically vest over a four year service\nperiod with 25% of the award vesting on each anniversary of the employee’s vesting commencement date. Performance-based restricted stock units\ntypically vest on the earliest date that any of the following occurs: (i) the Company attains an incremental capital investment, or (ii) other specified\nperformance conditions. Options typically expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.\nStock Options\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 4,059,043 service-based options outstanding under the 2020 Plan.\n16\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s option activity under the 2020 Plan for the six months ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted-Average\nRemaining\nWeighted-Average Contractual Term\nOptions Exercise Price (years)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 3,313,080 $ 9.27 8.29\nGranted 999,500 5.04\nExercised (6,044) 8.94\nCancelled or forfeited (247,493) 8.95\nOutstanding as of June 30, 2024 4,059,043 $ 8.26 8.26\nOptions exercisable as of June 30, 2024 1,918,290 $ 9.41 7.43\nVested and expected to vest as of June 30, 2024 4,059,043 $ 8.26 8.26\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s unvested option activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted-Average Grant\nNumber of Shares Date Fair Value\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023 1,729,909 $ 3.96\nGranted 999,500 2.66\nVested (459,973) 3.71\nForfeited (128,683) 3.71\nUnvested at June 30, 2024 2,140,753 $ 3.42\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 under the 2020 Plan\nwas $2.66 and $2.53, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested stock options was $7.1 million, which is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted average period of 2.61 years.\nRestricted Stock Units\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 3,368,859 restricted stock units outstanding under the 2020 Plan.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s unvested restricted stock unit activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date Fair\nNumber of Shares Value\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023 2,879,418 $ 8.51\nGranted 1,919,799 4.52\nVested (1,045,983) 7.02\nForfeited (384,375) 6.11\nUnvested at June 30, 2024 3,368,859 $ 6.97\nAs of June 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested restricted stock units was $16.4 million, which is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted average period of 2.31 years.\nSpaceMobile 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn connection with the Business Combination, the Company adopted the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The aggregate number of\ncommon stock shares that may be issued pursuant to rights granted under the ESPP is 2,000,000 shares. If any right granted under the ESPP terminates for\nany reason without having been exercised, the shares not purchased under such right become available again for issuance under the ESPP. As of June 30,\n2024, the Company had not issued any awards under this plan.\n17\n10. Income Taxes\nThe Company, organized as a C corporation, owns an equity interest in AST LLC in what is commonly referred to as an “Up-C” structure. For U.S. federal\nand state income tax purposes, AST LLC has elected to be treated as a partnership and does not pay any income taxes since its income and losses are\nincluded in the returns of the members. The portion of the Company’s taxable income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests of AST LLC is\ntaxed directly to such members. Consequently, no provision for income taxes has been included in the financial statements related to this portion of taxable\nincome. Certain foreign wholly-owned entities are taxed as corporations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, and accruals for such taxes are included\nin the consolidated financial statements. The Company has operations in India, Scotland, Spain, and Israel, with tax filings in each foreign jurisdiction.\nThe consolidated effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was (0.18)% and (0.31)%, respectively, and the consolidated effective\ntax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was 1.57% and 0.70%, respectively. The difference between the federal statutory tax rate of 21%\nand the effective tax rate is primarily driven by the Company’s Up-C organizational structure and allocation of AST LLC results to noncontrolling interest\nholders and the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company recorded a net deferred tax asset for the difference between the book value and tax basis of the Company’s investment in AST LLC at the\ntime of the Business Combination. The Company has assessed the realizability of their deferred tax assets and in that analysis has considered the relevant\npositive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nAs a result, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset resulting from the Business Combination. As of June 30,\n2024, there is no valuation allowance recorded against the foreign deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the foreign deferred tax assets will be\nfully realized. The foreign deferred tax assets are subject to foreign exchange risk, which could reduce the amount the Company may ultimately realize.\nThe Company had no uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nIn conjunction with the Business Combination, the Company also entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) with AST LLC. Pursuant to the\nTRA, the Company is required to pay TRA holders (as defined in the TRA) (i) 85% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign\nincome tax that the Company actually realizes as a result of (A) existing tax basis of certain assets of AST LLC and its subsidiaries attributable to the AST\nLLC Common Units, (B) tax basis adjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of AST LLC Common Units acquired by the Company, (C) tax\ndeductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the TRA, and (D) certain tax attributes that are acquired directly or indirectly by the\nCompany pursuant to a reorganization transaction. All such payments to the TRA holders (as defined in the TRA) are the obligations of the Company, and\nnot those of AST LLC. As of June 30, 2024, there have been no TRA liabilities recorded.\n11. Net Loss per Share\nBasic and diluted net loss per share attributable to the holders of Class A Common Stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding during the period.\nThe following table sets forth reconciliations of the numerators and denominators used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share of Class A Common\nStock (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nNumerator\nNet loss before allocation to noncontrolling interest $ (131,350) $ (171,154)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (58,800) (78,874)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders - basic and diluted $ (72,550) $ (92,280)\nDenominator\nWeighted-average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding -\nbasic and diluted 141,185,500 131,316,319\nNet loss per share attributable to holders of Class A Common Stock -\nbasic and diluted $ (0.51) $ (0.70)\n18\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2023\nNumerator\nNet loss before allocation to noncontrolling interest $ (49,589) $ (94,805)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (31,181) (60,079)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders - basic and diluted $ (18,408) $ (34,726)\nDenominator\nWeighted-average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding -\nbasic and diluted 75,640,650 73,753,412\nNet loss per share attributable to holders of Class A Common Stock -\nbasic and diluted $ (0.24) $ (0.47)\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share 39,747,447 shares of Class B Common Stock, 78,163,078\nshares of Class C Common Stock, 12,671,037 Public Warrants, 4,926,563 Private Placement Warrants, 862,625 unvested performance-based restricted\nstock units, and 25,732,053 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes (on an as-converted basis) as their effect\nwould have been to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding used to\ncalculate both basic and diluted net loss per share of Class A Common Stock is the same.\nShares of the Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock do not participate in the earnings or losses of the Company and are therefore not\nparticipating securities. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock under\nthe two-class method has not been presented.\n12. Related Parties\nVodafone\nAST LLC and Vodafone have agreed to enter into one or more definitive agreements for a commercial partnership that is anticipated to use the\nSpaceMobile Service (the “Vodafone Commercial Agreements”). In connection with the commercial agreement, AST LLC, its subsidiaries, and affiliates\nhave agreed not to enter into any agreement, term sheet, or letter of intent that grants another party the rights related to the provision of mobile services in\nthe Vodafone markets or Vodafone partner markets prior to the execution of the Vodafone Commercial Agreements.\nThe Vodafone Commercial Agreements are to include mutual exclusivity, conditioned upon Vodafone making the SpaceMobile Service available to all of\nits customers and certain promotional efforts, within all Vodafone markets for five years commencing on the launch of a commercial service in all of the\nVodafone markets; preferential commercial terms in Vodafone partner markets; 50/50 revenue share for the SpaceMobile Service in Vodafone exclusivity\nmarkets; and the procurement, building and operating of mobile network ground stations at a mutually agreed cost by Vodafone. No payments have been\nmade to date between AST LLC and Vodafone pursuant to the anticipated Vodafone Commercial Agreements. Vodafone has the right to designate one\nindividual to the Company’s Board of Directors. Currently, Vodafone’s designee is Luke Ibbetson, Head of Group Research & Development, Vodafone.\nAST LLC entered into a side letter with Vodafone dated December 15, 2020, under which AST LLC has agreed (i) not to enter into any material corporate\nstrategic relationship or material commercial agreement with a party other than Vodafone and its affiliates that would be reasonably expected to materially\nfrustrate AST LLC’s ability to satisfy the obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements with certain exceptions; (ii) to allocate sufficient funds\nin the capital budget to facilitate compliance with the obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements; and (iii) not to alter the business plan in a\nmanner that is materially detrimental to AST LLC’s ability to satisfy the obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements.\nOn January 16, 2024, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with Vodafone, among others. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Vodafone\npurchased the Company’s Convertible Notes for an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million. In connection with the investment, Vodafone Group\nServices Limited (“Vodafone Group Services”) entered into a letter agreement with AST LLC and the Company (the “Letter Agreement”). The Letter\nAgreement between Vodafone Group Services and AST LLC provides, among other things, for an initial revenue commitment of $25.0 million to AST\nLLC to be paid by Vodafone Group Services over a two and a half year period to be defined in a future definitive agreement for AST LLC to provide\nconnectivity services. Also, Vodafone submitted a purchase order for network equipment from AST LLC to support planned commercial service.\n19\nAmerican Tower\nAST LLC and American Tower have entered into a side letter agreement which was subsequently amended and restated on December 15, 2020. The side\nletter contemplates that AST LLC and American Tower will enter into commercial agreements to use American Tower facilities for the terrestrial gateway\nfacilities in certain markets. The term of the operational agreement with American Tower is for an anticipated five years after the initial launch of\ncommercial mobile services by AST LLC.\nOn March 22, 2022, AST LLC and American Tower entered into a non-binding term sheet reflecting the terms and conditions for the deployment of AST\nLLC gateway satellite technology equipment on property owned and operated by American Tower. Under the agreement, American Tower will provide\nAST LLC leased space and managed services at its current and future tower sites and data centers under the global master lease agreement to be entered\ninto by the parties.\nThe usage of any American Tower services in a Vodafone market will be memorialized in a commercial agreement among all three parties. In markets\nwhere Vodafone does not operate (“Carrier Neutral Markets”), AST LLC and American Tower may enter into an agreement for American Tower to manage\nthe operation of our deployed gateway facility in such market. In Carrier Neutral Markets where the Company requires a third party to provide a gateway\nfacility or services, AST LLC agrees to not accept any bid\nthat is inferior to American Tower’s best and final proposal for such gateway facility or services. AST LLC also agrees to use commercially reasonable\nefforts to utilize American Tower facilities in (i) Vodafone markets where Vodafone decides to not use its facilities, (ii) in Carrier Neutral Markets, and (iii)\ninstances where the Company requires a third-party vendor.\nAdditionally, AST LLC will work with American Tower to evaluate and plan gateway facility and radio access network data center deployments with\npreferred vendor status to offer carrier-neutral hosting facilities in certain equatorial markets. American Tower will serve as the preferred vendor for carrier\nneutral hosting facilities. AST LLC will pay American Tower a monthly connection fee for use of a carrier neutral hosting facility, which AST LLC expects\nwill be charged back to each applicable Mobile Network Operator (“MNO”). If AST LLC and American Tower agree to construct a new carrier neutral\nhosting facility or improve an existing one and American Tower elects to fund all such capital expenditures, American Tower will provide AST LLC with a\nfair-market, long-term lease to such facility. No payments have been made to date between AST LLC and American Tower under the amended and restated\nletter agreement. American Tower has the right to designate one individual to the Company’s Board of Directors. Currently, American Tower's designee is\nEd Knapp, Chief Technology Officer, American Tower.\nRakuten\nOn February 4, 2020, AST LLC entered into a commercial agreement with Rakuten for the development of exclusive network capabilities in Japan\ncompatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates, which agreement was amended and restated as of December 15, 2020 (the “Rakuten\nAgreement”). Under the terms of the Rakuten Agreement, AST LLC agreed to make investments in building network capabilities in Japan that are\ncompatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates. Furthermore, AST LLC will collaborate with Rakuten to ensure network capability with\nRakuten’s licensed frequencies, including full coverage in Japan with 3GPP Band 3 frequencies with multiple input multiple output (“MIMO”) capability.\nUpon the launch of such coverage, Rakuten will receive unlimited, exclusive rights and usage capacity in Japan in exchange for a $0.5 million annual\nmaintenance fee payable to AST LLC or our successors. Furthermore, AST LLC will make $5.0 million (or such lesser amount as mutually agreed upon\nthe parties) in capital investments towards the design, assembly, acquisition and implementation of ground communication assets. AST LLC and Rakuten\nwill receive unlimited rights and usage of the ground assets for their respective operations, including, but not limited to, satellite and other\ntelecommunication communications. The term of the Rakuten Agreement shall remain in effect until AST LLC fulfills obligations under the Rakuten\nAgreement. Rakuten has the right to designate two individuals to the Company’s Board of Directors. Currently, Rakuten has designated Hiroshi Mikitani,\nFounder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rakuten, Inc. as a director and has the right to designate another individual.\nThe Rakuten Agreement includes key performance indicators (“KPIs”) associated with the number of satellites launched, timing and coverage of the\nSpaceMobile Service in Japan in a phased manner that AST LLC was obligated to meet by June 2023. In connection with AST LLC’s inability to meet the\napplicable KPIs stated in the Rakuten Agreement by the deadline, the Company recognized an expense of $10.0 million recorded in Other (expense)\nincome, net in the first quarter of 2023 and paid the amount in the third quarter of 2023.\nInvesat and Antares Technologies\nOn March 4, 2024, the Company and Invesat LLC (“Invesat”), which is part of the Cisneros Group of Companies, of which Ms. Adriana Cisneros, a\nmember of the Company's Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer, completed a series of transactions (including a Blocker Merger Transaction as\ndefined in the A&R Operating Agreement, the “Antares Transactions”) resulting in the acquisition by Antares Technologies LLC (“Antares”) of\n10,445,200 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. As part of the Antares\n20\nTransactions, Invesat exercised 319,033 AST Incentive Equity Options and 9,932,541 shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and 200,000 shares\nof the Company’s Class A Common Stock previously held by Invesat were cancelled. In addition, the Company received 10,245,200 AST LLC Common\nUnits held by Invesat prior to the Antares Transactions. After giving effect to the Antares Transactions, the separate limited liability company existence of\nInvesat ceased.\nIn connection with the Antares Transactions, the Stockholders’ Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement were amended to add an affiliate of\nInvesat, Antares, and remove Invesat as a party thereto to allow Antares to benefit from all of the rights previously held by Invesat thereunder. Antares has\nthe right to designate one individual to our Board. Currently, Antares has designated Ms. Adriana Cisneros as a director.\n13.

Our SpaceMobile\nService is being designed to provide cost-effective, high-speed Cellular Broadband services to end-users who are out of terrestrial cellular coverage using\nexisting mobile devices. The SpaceMobile Service currently is planned to be provided by a constellation of high-powered, large phased-array satellites in\nLow Earth Orbit (“LEO”) using low band and middle band spectrum controlled by Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”). We are headquartered in Texas\nwhere we operate 185,000 square feet satellite assembly, integrating and testing (“AIT”) facilities. Our IP portfolio is diverse, containing numerous and\nvarious innovations of the direct-to-cell satellite ecosystem from space to Earth. Our IP portfolio consists of 36 patent families worldwide. As of June 30,\n2024, we had more than 3,400 patent and patent pending claims worldwide, of which approximately 1,240 have been officially granted or allowed.\nWe intend to work with MNOs to offer the SpaceMobile Service to the MNOs’ end-user customers. Our vision is that users will not need to subscribe to the\nSpaceMobile Service directly through us, nor will they need to purchase any new or additional equipment. Instead, users will be able to access the\nSpaceMobile Service when prompted on their mobile device that they are no longer within range of the land-based facilities of the MNO operator or will be\nable to purchase a plan directly with their existing mobile provider. We intend to seek to use a revenue-sharing business model for SpaceMobile Service in\nour agreements with MNOs.\nThe SpaceMobile Service is expected to be highly attractive to MNOs as it will enable them to improve and differentiate their service offering without\nsignificant incremental capital investments. The SpaceMobile Service is expected to enable MNOs to augment and extend their coverage without building\ntowers or other land-based infrastructure, including where it is not cost-justified or is difficult due to geographical challenges. As a result of the incremental\ncoverage created by the planned SpaceMobile Service, we believe that MNOs will have the opportunity to increase subscribers’ average revenue per user\n(“ARPU”).\nOn April 1, 2019, we launched our first test satellite, BW1, which was used to validate our satellite to cellular architecture and was capable of managing\ncommunications delays from LEO and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol.\n22\nWe launched our BlueWalker 3 (“BW3”) test satellite on September 10, 2022, and announced the completion of the deployment of the communication\nphased array antenna of the BW3 test satellite in orbit on November 14, 2022. On April 25, 2023, we announced that we had successfully completed two-\nway voice calls directly to standard unmodified smartphones using the BW3 test satellite. On June 21, 2023, we announced that we had achieved repeated\nsuccessful 4G download speeds of above 10 megabits per second (“Mbps”) to standard unmodified smartphones using the BW3 test satellite. On\nSeptember 19, 2023, we announced that we had achieved repeated successful two-way voice calls directly to standard unmodified smartphones using 5G\nconnectivity and successful download speeds of approximately 14 Mbps utilizing 5 megahertz (“Mhz”) of low band spectrum via the BW3 test satellite.\nSince then, we have achieved successful download speeds above 21 Mbps, spectral efficiency of approximately 3 bits per hertz, and have also successfully\ncompleted initial in-orbit and ground testing for non-communication government applications. We intend to continue testing capabilities of the BW3 test\nsatellite, including further testing with cellular service providers and the government.\nIn July 2024, we completed the final assembly, integration and testing of five of our first generation commercial BB satellites (“Block 1 BB satellites”).\nThe Block 1 BB satellites are of similar size and weight to the BW3 test satellite, include our own designed array solar panels and battery systems, and are\nexpected to have ten times higher throughput than the BW3 test satellite. The five Block 1 BB satellites are currently at the launch site awaiting an orbital\nlaunch in a 7-day launch window in September 2024. The exact timing of the launch is contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely\ncompletion of integration of the satellites with the launch vehicle, confirmation of the launch slot timing by the launch provider, weather conditions, and\nother factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe SpaceMobile Service has not been launched and therefore has not yet generated any revenue. Following the launch and deployment of five Block 1 BB\nsatellites, we currently plan to initiate a limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service in targeted geographical areas, including in the United States, and\nseek to generate revenue from such service. Prior to initiating SpaceMobile Service in each jurisdiction, we will need to obtain regulatory approvals in each\njurisdiction where we would provide such service and would need to enter into commercial agreements with MNOs relating to the offering of such service\nin each jurisdiction. We have received an initial license from the United States Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to launch and operate V, S\nand UHF frequencies to support gateway, feeder link and telemetry, tracking, and control operations for the first five Block 1 BB satellites in the United\nStates. We have entered into a space-based wireless connectivity agreement with AT&T Services, Inc. (“AT&T Services”) to provide SpaceMobile Service\nto AT&T Services’ end users for use within the continental United States (excluding Alaska) and Hawaii. We also plan to enter into similar commercial\nagreements with Verizon in the United States. Before we begin providing full commercial SpaceMobile Service in the United States, we will need to obtain\nadditional approvals from the FCC. We are expanding our efforts on ground infrastructure development for commercial readiness and integrating our\nSpaceMobile Service into the MNOs’ infrastructure to enable us to initiate commercial services.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, we have recognized revenue from completion of performance obligations under an agreement with a prime\ncontractor for the U.S. Government and expect to continue to recognize revenue throughout 2024 as and when we complete the remaining performance\nobligations under the agreement. In 2024, we expect to begin generating revenue from the resale of gateway equipment and associated services to MNOs\nand other third parties. We believe initiation of limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service, as well as completing the milestones under the agreement\nwith a prime contractor for the U.S. Government, will help to demonstrate the advantages of our satellite-based Cellular Broadband service in the market.\nThese market activities will commence while we continue the development and testing of the next generation of commercial BB satellites.\nOur next generation of commercial BB satellites (“Block 2 BB satellites”) are expected to derive greater performance through the introduction of our own\nAST5000 Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”) chip, which we believe will enable materially greater throughput capacity of up to 40 MHz per\nbeam to support 120 Mbps peak data rates and up to 10,000 MHz of processing bandwidth per Block 2 BB satellite, require less power and offer a lower\noverall unit cost. As of the date of this report, we have completed the design and tape-out of our ASIC chip. Until the qualification and assembly of our\nASIC chip is complete, we expect to continue to manufacture and launch Block 2 BB satellites that are based on a FPGA (“Field Programmable Gate\nArrays”) chip. The Block 2 BB satellites are expected to be approximately 2,400 square feet in size, almost 3.5 times bigger than the Block 1 BB satellites,\nand will have the largest phased array ever deployed in a LEO for commercial use exceeding the phased array of the BW3 test satellite and the Block 1 BB\nsatellites. We believe the larger aperture array is expected to provide greater spectrum reuse, enhanced signal strength and increased capacity, thereby\nreducing the necessary number of satellites to achieve service coverage as compared to smaller apertures.\nWe continue to make progress towards the completion of the design and development of our Block 2 BB satellites. We believe we will benefit from the\nskills, technological expertise, and manufacturing know-how derived from the assembly and testing of our Block 1 BB satellite in the development and\nassembly of our Block 2 BB satellites. We are vertically integrated for manufacturing of satellite components and subsystems to reduce our dependency on\nsuppliers, ensure timely supply of satellite components and subsystems to meet our launch timeline, and lower the overall cost of BB satellites. We own or\nlicense the IP and control the manufacturing process, either internally or with contract manufacturers, for approximately 95% of the sub-systems planned to\nbe used in our Block 2 BB satellites. We began the design and development of the Block 2 BB satellites prior to the design and development of Block 1 BB\n23\nsatellites. We have secured agreements and placed orders for procurement of components and subsystems required for manufacturing of Block 2 BB\nsatellites. We have commenced manufacturing the components and subsystems for Block 2 BB satellites. We have entered into an agreement with a launch\nservice provider to launch the first Block 2 BB satellite. While the agreement has a preliminary launch window in the first quarter of 2025, the agreement\nallows us to alter the launch window, at our option and at no additional cost, subject to the launch vehicle provider’s launch schedule availability. The exact\ntiming of the launch has not been determined and is contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of the design,\nassembly and testing of the Block 2 BB satellite, regulatory approvals, availability of launch windows by the launch providers, logistics, and other factors,\nmany of which are beyond our control.\nWe are developing a phased satellite deployment plan and corresponding commercial launch plan of the SpaceMobile Service based on targeted\ngeographical areas to provide the SpaceMobile Service to the most commercially attractive MNO markets. This prioritization of coverage is designed to\nminimize the capital required to initiate and operate commercial service that generates cash flows from operating activities sooner. We expect that such a\nsuccessful commercial service would enable us to attract additional capital to continue to assemble and launch additional BB satellites to expand our\ncapacity and geographic coverage area, although there can be no assurance that such capital would be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe plan to achieve service in the selected, targeted geographical areas with the launch and operation of 25 BB satellites and achieve substantial service in\nall targeted geographical areas to meet our long term business goals with the launch and operation of approximately 95 BB satellites. We anticipate\nlaunching and deploying additional satellites beyond the initial 95 satellites in order to enhance coverage and system capacity in response to incremental\nmarket demand. Our current plan is subject to numerous uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including timely supply of materials and\ncomponents, satisfactory and timely completion of design, assembly and testing of the satellites, availability of launch vehicles aligned with our timeline,\navailability of launch windows by the launch providers, proposed orbits and resulting satellite coverage, launch costs, ability to enter into agreements with\nMNOs, regulatory approvals, our ability to raise capital, and other factors. We may adopt a strategy for commercial launch of the SpaceMobile Service,\nincluding the nature and type of services offered and the geographic areas where we may launch such services, that may differ materially from our current\nplan.\nWe are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth\ncompanies. Please refer to Risk Factors contained in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nRecent Developments\nVerizon Investment and Memorandum of Understanding\nOn May 23, 2024, we and Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) entered into a Convertible Note and Memorandum of Understanding for an\ninvestment and commercial prepayment commitment totaling $100.0 million (the “Verizon Investment”). In connection with the Verizon Investment,\nVerizon purchased Convertible Notes (as described below) for an aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million, made an initial $20.0 million commercial\npayment that is creditable against future service revenue of AST & Science LLC (“AST LLC”), and will make a second $45.0 million commercial payment\nwhen we receive certain regulatory approvals for our SpaceMobile Service and enter into a definitive commercial agreement with Verizon. The second\ncommercial payment will be creditable against future service revenue of AST LLC.\nAT&T Commercial Agreement\nOn May 10, 2024, AST LLC and AT&T Services entered into a space-based wireless connectivity agreement (the “AT&T Commercial Agreement”) for\nAST LLC to provide, and AT&T Services to purchase access to and utilize our network and satellite services to provide service offerings to AT&T\nServices’ end users enabled by the satellite services for use within the continental United States (excluding Alaska) and Hawaii. AT&T Services will pay to\nAST LLC a percentage of the gross monthly revenue AT&T Services bills to its end users for the services enabled by the satellite services. In addition,\nAT&T Services will make a non-refundable commercial payment to AST LLC after the launch and successful initial operation of the five Block 1 BB\nsatellites, which will be credited against AST LLC’s future share of gross monthly revenue. The AT&T Commercial Agreement expires on December 31,\n2030, subject to auto-renewal for successive two-year periods unless either party terminates in accordance with the terms of the AT&T Commercial\nAgreement.\n24\nImpact of Global Macroeconomic Conditions and Geopolitical Conflicts\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including heightened inflation, changes to fiscal and monetary policies, higher\ninterest rates, volatility in the capital markets, supply chain challenges, and geopolitical conflicts on all aspects of our business across geographies,\nincluding how it has and may continue to impact our operations, workforce, suppliers, and our ability to raise additional capital to fund operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nChanges in the prices of satellite materials due to inflation, supply chain challenges, and other macroeconomic factors, as well as changes in the launch\ncosts, may affect our capital costs estimates to build and launch the satellite constellation and adversely affect our financial condition. The extent of impact\nof these factors on our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time. To date,\nthese factors have not had a material impact to our technology development efforts or results of our operations. However, if macroeconomic conditions\ndeteriorate or there are unforeseen developments, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe operate from multiple locations that include our corporate headquarters and 185,000 square feet AIT facilities in Texas where the final AIT is\nperformed, and engineering and development centers elsewhere in the United States, India, Scotland, Spain and Israel. Our operations in Israel constitute\napproximately 2% of our total assets as of June 30, 2024 and approximately 9% and 10%, respectively, of total operating expenses for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024. To date, our operations in Israel have not been materially impacted by the geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. We\ncurrently do not expect potential interruptions to our operations in Israel to have a material impact on the Company.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Our Future Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations\nOur historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by our ability to execute on our strategy.\nWe believe that our future results of operations could differ materially from the historical results of operations as we launch the five Block 1 BB satellites\nand initiate the limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service in certain targeted geographical areas, fulfill our obligations under an agreement with a prime\ncontractor of a U.S. Government contract, complete the tape-out and qualification of our ASIC chip, complete the development of the Block 2 BB\nsatellites, increase our capacity and scale to manufacture BB satellites, launch the first Block 2 BB satellite, and enter into commercial arrangements with\nMNOs.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from our SpaceMobile Service and do not expect to generate revenue until we launch the SpaceMobile\nService. All revenues recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were generated from completion of performance obligations under\nan agreement with a prime contractor for the U.S. Government. We expect to continue to recognize revenue under this agreement throughout 2024 as and\nwhen we complete the remaining performance obligations under the agreement. We also expect to generate revenue from the resale of gateway equipment\nand associated services to the MNOs and third parties as and when we complete our performance obligations under these contracts with the customers.\nEngineering Services Costs\nEngineering services costs are charged to expense as incurred. Engineering services costs consist primarily of the cost of employees and consultants\ninvolved in the design and development of the BB satellites and fulfillment of performance obligations under contracts with the customers, managing the\nnetwork and satellite operations centers, indirect costs related to the assembly, integration and testing of the BB satellites, license cost, and general\nexpenses related to AIT facilities and engineering development centers.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs include the costs of insurance, cost of non-engineering personnel and personnel related expenses, software licensing and\nsubscriptions, office and facilities expenses, investor relations, and professional services, including public relations, accounting and legal fees.\nResearch and Development Costs\nR&D costs are charged to expense as incurred. R&D costs consist principally of development activities in which we typically engage third-party vendors\nand are largely driven by the achievement of milestones that trigger payments. It also includes costs of materials and supplies consumed in the R&D\nactivities such as development of prototype components and subsystems, and production of engineering\n25\nmodels to support assembly, integration and testing of the BB satellites. R&D costs are expected to fluctuate quarter over quarter depending on\nachievement of milestones.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation expense related to property and equipment including the BW3 test satellite, as well as definite\nlived intangible assets. We began depreciating the BW3 test satellite as of April 25, 2023 over its expected remaining useful life of approximately 16\nmonths. We expect the BW3 test satellite to be fully depreciated by the end of August 2024.\nGain (Loss) on Remeasurement of Warrant Liabilities\nPublic Warrants and Private Placement Warrants issued by us are accounted for as liability-classified instruments at their initial fair value on the date of\nissuance. They are remeasured on each balance sheet date and changes in the estimated fair value are recognized as an unrealized gain or loss in the\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest (expense) income, net consists of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our debt arrangements, including\nconvertible notes, net of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing demand deposit accounts.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of non-operating expense and income, including foreign exchange gains or losses.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nAST LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, all income, losses, and other tax attributes pass through to\nthe members’ income tax returns, and no U.S. federal and state and local provision for income taxes has been recorded for AST LLC in the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. Certain foreign wholly-owned entities are taxed as corporations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, and\naccruals for such taxes are included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nNoncontrolling interest primarily represents the equity interest in AST LLC held by members other than us. As of June 30, 2024, noncontrolling interest in\nAST LLC was approximately 44.2%. We attribute a portion of net income or loss generated at AST LLC to the noncontrolling interest based on their\nownership interests.\n26\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023\nWe report our results of operations under one operating segment. The following table sets forth a summary of our unaudited condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands), and the discussion that follows compares the three months\nended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nFor the Three Months Ended June 30,\n(unaudited)\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenues $ 900 $ - $ 900 $ 100 %\nOperating expenses:\nEngineering services costs 21,202 22,813 (1,611) (7)\nGeneral and administrative costs 17,839 10,221 7,618 75\nResearch and development costs 4,460 10,921 (6,461) (59)\nDepreciation and amortization 20,392 14,115 6,277 44\nTotal operating expenses 63,893 58,070 5,823 10\nOther income (expense):\n(Loss) gain on remeasurement of warrant liabilities (66,140) 6,475 (72,615) (1,121)\nInterest (expense) income, net (2,238) 1,724 (3,962) (230)\nOther income (expense), net 252 (507) 759 150\nTotal other income (expense), net (68,126) 7,692 (75,818) (986)\nLoss before income tax (expense) benefit (131,119) (50,378) (80,741) (160)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (231) 789 (1,020) (129)\nNet loss before allocation to noncontrolling interest (131,350) (49,589) (81,761) (165)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (58,800) (31,181) (27,619) (89)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (72,550) $ (18,408) $ (54,142) (294) %\nRevenues\nRevenues for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were attributable to completion of performance obligations under an agreement with a prime contractor\nfor a U.S. Government contract, which was entered into in the first quarter of 2024. We had no such agreements in the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nEngineering Services Costs\nTotal engineering services costs decreased by $1.6 million, or 7%, to $21.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $3.1 million in payroll and employee related costs, and partially\noffset by an increase of $0.8 million in AIT facilities and engineering development centers costs, including managing mission operations and ground\ninfrastructure, and an increase of $0.7 million in travel expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nTotal general and administrative costs increased by $7.6 million, or 75%, to $17.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a $6.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and other employee\nrelated costs, a $0.4 million increase in professional services fees, a $0.3 million increase in travel expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in office and\nfacilities expenses.\nResearch and Development Costs\nTotal R&D costs decreased by $6.5 million, or 59%, to $4.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to three months ended June 30,\n2023. The decrease in R&D costs were driven by completion of design and development of certain sub systems for the Block 2 BB satellites, completion of\ncertain milestones related to the development of ground infrastructure programs for commercial readiness, completion of design and development for Block\n1 BB satellites, and completion of the design phase of our ASIC chip.\n27\nDepreciation and Amortization\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense increased by $6.3 million, or 44%, to $20.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to\nthe three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the commencement of the BW3 test satellite depreciation from April 25, 2023.\n(Loss) gain on Remeasurement of Warrant Liabilities\nThe increase in fair value of warrant liabilities resulted in a loss of $66.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 largely due to a significant\nincrease in our share price as compared to a gain of $6.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense, net was $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to interest income, net of $1.7 million for the three months\nended June 30, 2023. The net change of $3.9 million was primarily attributed to an increase of $4.8 million in interest expense and amortization of debt\nissuance costs incurred in connection with our debt arrangements, partially offset by an $0.8 million increase in interest income earned on cash and cash\nequivalents held in interest bearing demand deposit accounts.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net was $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to other expense, net of $0.5 million for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023. The net change of $0.8 million was primarily due to a $2.6 million increase in other non-operating income and a $0.3 million decrease in\nforeign exchange loss, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in loss on disposal of fixed assets.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nThe provision for income taxes was $(0.2) million and $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The consolidated\neffective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was (0.18)% and 1.57%, respectively. Refer to Note 10: Income Taxes in the\naccompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.\nNet Loss attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $58.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $31.2 million in the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. This increase in net loss correlates with the increase in net loss generated at AST LLC given the noncontrolling interest\nrepresents a portion of such net loss.\n28\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023\nWe report our results of operations under one operating segment. The following table sets forth a summary of our unaudited condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands), and the discussion that follows compares the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nFor the Six Months Ended June 30,\n(unaudited)\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenues $ 1,400 $ - $ 1,400 100 %\nOperating expenses:\nEngineering services costs 40,719 39,296 1,423 4\nGeneral and administrative costs 30,126 20,078 10,048 50\nResearch and development costs 8,711 27,302 (18,591) (68)\nDepreciation and amortization 40,336 15,848 24,488 155\nTotal operating expenses 119,892 102,524 17,368 17\nOther income (expense):\n(Loss) gain on remeasurement of warrant liabilities (47,926) 13,973 (61,899) (443)\nInterest (expense) income, net (4,460) 3,816 (8,276) (217)\nOther income (expense), net 250 (10,743) 10,993 102\nTotal other income (expense), net (52,136) 7,046 (59,182) (840)\nLoss before income tax (expense) benefit (170,628) (95,478) (75,150) (79)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (526) 673 (1,199) (178)\nNet loss before allocation to noncontrolling interest (171,154) (94,805) (76,349) (81)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (78,874) (60,079) (18,795) (31)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (92,280) $ (34,726) $ (57,554) (166) %\nRevenues\nRevenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were attributable to completion of performance obligations under an agreement with a prime contractor\nfor a U.S. Government contract, which was entered into in the first quarter of 2024. We had no such agreements in the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nEngineering Services Costs\nTotal engineering services costs increased by $1.4 million, or 4%, to $40.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the six months\nended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.3 million in AIT facilities and engineering development centers costs\nincluding managing mission operations and ground infrastructure and an increase of $1.1 million in travel expenses, partially offset by a $3.0 million\ndecrease in payroll and employee related costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nTotal general and administrative costs increased by $10.0 million, or 50%, to $30.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a $9.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and other employee\nrelated costs, a $0.6 million increase in travel expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in office and facilities expenses, partially offset by a $0.3 million\ndecrease in professional services fees.\nResearch and Development Costs\nTotal R&D costs decreased by $18.6 million, or 68%, to $8.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended June 30,\n2023. The decrease in R&D costs were driven by completion of design and development of certain sub systems for the Block 2 BB satellites, completion of\ncertain milestones related to the development of ground infrastructure programs for commercial readiness, completion of design and development for Block\n1 BB satellites, and completion of the design phase of our ASIC chip.\n29\nDepreciation and Amortization\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense increased by $24.5 million, or 155%, to $40.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to\nthe six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the commencement of the BW3 test satellite depreciation from April 25, 2023.\n(Loss) Gain on Remeasurement of Warrant Liabilities\nThe increase in fair value of warrant liabilities resulted in a loss of $47.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 largely due to a significant\nincrease in our share price as compared to a gain of $14.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nInterest (Expense) Income, Net\nInterest expense, net was $4.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the interest income, net of $3.8 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023. The net change of $8.3 million was primarily attributed to an increase of $9.2 million in interest expense and amortization of debt\nissuance costs incurred in connection with our debt arrangements, partially offset by an $0.9 million increase in interest income earned on cash and cash\nequivalents held in interest bearing demand deposit accounts.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income, net was $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to other expense, net of $10.7 million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023. The net change of $11.0 million was primarily due to a nonrecurring $10.0 million payment due to a related party recognized in the first\nquarter of 2023, a $2.6 million increase in other non-operating income, and a $0.4 million decrease in foreign exchange loss, partially offset by a $2.2\nmillion increase in loss on disposal of fixed assets.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nThe income tax expense was $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the income tax benefit of $0.7 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023. The consolidated effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was (0.31%) and 0.70%, respectively. Refer to\nNote 10: Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $78.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $60.1 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023. This increase in net loss correlates with the increase in net loss generated at AST LLC given the noncontrolling interest represents a\nportion of such net loss.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur current sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of June 30, 2024, we had $287.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand,\nwhich included $2.5 million of restricted cash, which reflects proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes (as described below), the sale of shares\nof our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Equity Program (as described below) and the January 2024 Common Stock Offering (as described below).\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs, planned operating expenses and capital\nexpenditures for a period of 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report.\nThe design, assembly, integration, testing and launch of satellites and related ground infrastructure is capital intensive. We currently estimate the capital\nexpenditure, primarily direct materials and launch costs, for the assembly, integration, testing and launch of the five Block 1 BB satellites to not materially\nexceed $115.0 million. We expect to leverage our experience of Block 1 manufacturing to improve and optimize the manufacturing costs for our Block 2\nsatellites. We have fully paid the Block 1 estimated cost as of the date of this Quarterly Report.\nWe believe we need to launch and operate 25 BB satellites (five Block 1 BB satellites and 20 Block 2 BB satellites) in order to provide coverage to the\nmost commercially attractive MNO markets. In addition to the cash and cash equivalents we had on hand as of June 30, 2024, we currently estimate we\nwill need to raise approximately $275.0 million to $325.0 million to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures necessary to design, assemble and\nlaunch 20 Block 2 BB satellites and operate a constellation of 25 BB satellites.\n30\nWe evaluate our market, product and coverage plans based upon the attractiveness of certain markets, our technology, regulatory concerns and our access to\ncapital and other resources. We believe we can develop satellite configurations which target delivering service to certain attractive markets without the\nnecessity of building a constellation which covers the entire globe. This modularity of our satellite configuration enables us to alter the timing and size of\nour satellite roll out and provides us flexibility to dynamically change our market plans and capital requirements. As a result, we believe we have the ability\nto accelerate or slow down our business plan depending upon the availability of capital to support our strategies.\nWe plan to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities (secured or unsecured), secured or unsecured loans or\nother debt facilities, and credit from government or financial institutions or commercial partners. We also intend to seek to draw the remaining available\ncredit under the Senior Secured Credit Facility (as described below). Our ability to access the capital markets during this period of volatility may require us\nto modify our current expectations. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise\nadditional funds when needed in the future, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nCommitments\nPursuant to the Convertible Security Investment Agreement (as described below) which we entered into with certain investors, we issued subordinated\nconvertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”) for an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million on January 16, 2024 to AT&T Venture Investments, LLC\n(“AT&T”), Google LLC (“Google”) and Vodafone Ventures Limited (“Vodafone”), and for an aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million on May 23,\n2024 to Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”). The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on\nJune 30 and December 30 of each year, beginning on June 30, 2024. The AT&T, Google and Vodafone Convertible Notes have a 10-year term and the\nVerizon Convertible Notes have a 9 years and 9 months term unless earlier converted into Class A Common Stock at the option of the holder or us in\naccordance with the terms of the Convertible Security Investment Agreement.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no material changes in the contractual minimum principal and interest payments required on all of\nour outstanding debt, other than above, and operating leases described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had contractual commitments with third parties in the aggregate amount of $100.5 million related to the procurement of BB\nsatellite components, R&D programs, capital improvements, and future launch payments for Block 2 BB satellites. We expect these commitments will\ncontinue to increase as we make progress to assemble, integrate and test Block 2 BB satellites, and enter into launch agreements for the launch of Block 2\nBB satellites.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nOn September 8, 2022, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Sales Agreement” or “ATM Equity Program”) with Evercore Group L.L.C.\nand B. Riley Securities, Inc. (collectively, the “agents”) to sell shares of our Class A Common Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $150.0 million\nthrough an “at the market offering” program under which the agents acted as sales agents. The agents were entitled to total compensation at a commission\nrate of up to 3.0% of the gross sales price per share sold. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have sold shares of our Class A Common Stock up to\nthe authorized amount under the Sales Agreement; accordingly, the Sales Agreement has terminated pursuant to its terms. Proceeds from the sale of our\nClass A Common Stock under the Sales Agreement were and will continue to be used for general corporate purposes.\nTerm Loan\nIn December 2021, concurrent with the purchase of real property and equipment in Midland, Texas, our wholly-owned subsidiary, AST & Science Texas,\nLLC (“AST Texas”), entered into a credit agreement with Lone Star State Bank of West Texas (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) providing for a $5.0\nmillion term loan secured by the property. Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 4.20% per annum until December 7, 2026,\nand from December 8, 2026 until December 8, 2028 at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.20% plus adjustment if the index rate as defined in the Term Loan\nCredit Agreement is greater than 4.20%, subject to a maximum interest rate of 4.90% per annum. Refer to Note 5: Long-Term Debt in the accompanying\nnotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default, and certain covenants that limit AST Texas’ ability to, among other things,\ncreate liens on collateral, consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets, and enter into certain transactions with their\naffiliates. If AST Texas fails to perform its obligations under these and other covenants, or should any event of default occur, the term loan may be\nterminated and any outstanding borrowings, together with unpaid accrued interest, could be declared immediately due and payable, and the lender will be\nauthorized to take possession of the collateral.\n31\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn August 14, 2023, we entered into a senior secured term loan credit agreement with ACP Post Oak Credit II LLC as administrative agent and collateral\nagent and Atlas Credit Partners, LLC (“Atlas”) as lender, providing for a principal loan commitment of up to $100.0 million (the “Atlas Credit\nAgreement”), of which $48.5 million was borrowed upon closing. In addition, a two-year collateral protection insurance policy was issued to the lenders\nand a cash premium based on a single digit percentage of the amount drawn was paid to the insurance provider thereunder (the “Cash Premium”). An\nadditional amount of $51.5 million may be borrowed only to the extent we raise additional capital through equity raises and receive additional insurance\ncoverage such that we have insurance coverage equal to at least the amount of borrowings under the credit facility.\nThe initial borrowings of $48.5 million accrue interest at a fixed rate equal to three-month secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) as of the closing date\nplus 9.625% per annum equal to 14.75% (the “Atlas Fixed Rate”), payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. The borrowing amounts are\npayable at maturity on August 14, 2026 and are subject to mandatory prepayments upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\nBorrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets other than the assets of certain excluded subsidiaries. The Atlas Credit Agreement contains\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants, requires us to maintain certain levels of liquidity, limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make\nrestricted payments (including cash dividends on common stock), and sell or otherwise dispose of our assets, among other restrictions.\nUpon closing, we received net proceeds of $37.2 million, net of debt issuance costs of $9.5 million and deposit of $1.8 million into an interest reserve\nescrow account. Debt issuance costs of $9.5 million consist of agent fees, offering expenses, and two years of cash premium coverage. The net proceeds\nwere used for general corporate purposes as permitted under the Atlas Credit Agreement.\nCapital Equipment Loan\nOn August 14, 2023, we entered into a loan agreement with Lone Star as lender, providing for a $15.0 million principal term loan commitment secured by\ncertain real property fixtures and equipment in one of our Texas facilities (the “Lone Star Loan Agreement”).\nBorrowings accrue interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.75%, subject to a ceiling rate. Interest payments are due and payable on a monthly basis. Interest\npayments began in September 2023 and principal payments will begin in April 2025. Principal repayments are thereafter due in 48 equal monthly\ninstallments until January 2029, the maturity date of the loan. In connection with the Lone Star Loan Agreement, we deposited a cash balance of $15.0\nmillion in the Lone Star Bank Money Market Fund. This cash balance will be converted to restricted cash if we fail to maintain a consolidated balance of\ncash and cash equivalents of at least $75.0 million. This restricted cash will be used to offset against the term loan obligations if we fail to maintain a\nconsolidated balance of cash and cash equivalents of at least $50.0 million. In addition, the Lone Star Loan Agreement includes certain customary\naffirmative and negative covenants.\nWe drew the entire $15.0 million facility on September 19, 2023 and incurred $0.1 million of transaction costs. The net proceeds were used for general\ncorporate purposes.\nConvertible Security Investment Agreement\nPursuant to the Convertible Security Investment Agreement which we entered into with certain investors, we issued Convertible Notes for an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $110.0 million on January 16, 2024 to AT&T, Google, and Vodafone, and for an aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million on May\n23, 2024 to Verizon. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each\nyear, beginning on June 30, 2024. We have the option to pay interest on the Convertible Notes in cash or in kind. We elected to pay interest on the\nConvertible Notes in kind on June 30, 2024, resulting in the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being increased by approximately $3.0 million.\nInterest will accrue on such increased principal amount in subsequent interest periods. The AT&T, Google and Vodafone Convertible Notes have a 10-year\nterm unless earlier converted and the Verizon Convertible Notes have a 9 years and 9 months term unless earlier converted. The net proceeds of the\nConvertible Notes were and will continue to be used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert the Convertible Notes (subject to certain exceptions) at an initial conversion rate of 173.9130 shares of\nClass A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $5.75 per share of Class A Common\nStock). The Holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option on the Conversion Date, which is on or after January 16, 2025. On or after the\nConversion Date, we may require the Holders to convert the Convertible Notes (subject to certain exceptions), at an initial conversion rate of 173.9130\nshares of Class A Common Stock per\n32\n$1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $5.75 per share of Class A Common Stock) at our option, if the\nVWAP of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for 30 consecutive trading days, on the immediately\nsucceeding trading day after the last trading day of such 30 day period. The Convertible Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of\ndefault and fundamental change.\nJanuary 2024 Common Stock Offering\nOn January 23, 2024, we issued 32,258,064 shares of Class A Common Stock in a public offering and received proceeds of $93.6 million, net of\nunderwriting commissions of $6.0 million and transaction costs of $0.4 million. We provided a 30-day option to the underwriting agent to purchase up to\nan additional 4,838,709 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Option Shares”) from us on the same terms and conditions. On January 25, 2024, the\nOption Shares were exercised in full. The offering of the Option Shares closed on January 29, 2024 for proceeds of $14.1 million, net of underwriting\ncommissions of $0.9 million. Proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock under the January 2024 Common Stock Offering were used for general\ncorporate purposes.\nCommercial Prepayments\nOn May 23, 2024, in connection with the Verizon Investment, Cellco Partnership, a Delaware general partnership doing business as Verizon Wireless, on\nbehalf of itself and its controlled and/or managed affiliates (“Verizon Wireless”), entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with AST LLC and us (the\n“MOU”). The MOU provides, among other things, that Verizon Wireless will make (i) an initial $20.0 million commercial payment for prepaid service\nrevenue, creditable against future service revenue of AST LLC and (ii) a second $45.0 million commercial payment for prepaid service revenue, creditable\nagainst future service revenue of AST LLC, subject to us receiving certain regulatory approvals for our SpaceMobile Service and entry into a definitive\ncommercial agreement. We have received the initial $20.0 million prepayment from Verizon and recognized it as contract liabilities. Refer to Note 2:\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further\ninformation.\nOn May 10, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement dated January 16, 2024 by and among us, AST LLC and AT&T Services, AST LLC and\nAT&T Services entered into the AT&T Commercial Agreement for AST LLC to provide, and AT&T Services to purchase access to and utilize our network\nand satellite services to provide service offerings to AT&T Services’ end users enabled by the satellite services for use within the continental United States\n(excluding Alaska) and Hawaii. AT&T Services will pay to AST LLC a percentage of the gross monthly revenue AT&T Services bills to its end users for\nthe services enabled by the satellite services. In addition, AT&T Services will make a non-refundable commercial payment of $20.0 million to AST LLC\nafter the launch and successful initial operation of the five Block 1 BB satellites, which will be credited against AST LLC’s future share of gross monthly\nrevenue. The AT&T Commercial Agreement expires on December 31, 2030, subject to auto-renewal for successive two-year periods unless either party\nterminates in accordance with the terms of the AT&T Commercial Agreement.\nCash Flows\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands) (unaudited):\nFor the Six Months ended June 30,\n(unaudited)\n2024 2023\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 287,567 $ 191,471\nCash used in operating activities $ (64,274) $ (87,989)\nCash used in investing activities (61,770) (22,972)\nCash provided by financing activities 325,743 63,627\nOperating activities\nCash used in operating activities was $64.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to cash used in operating activities of $88.0\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The $23.7 million decrease was attributable to a decrease of $22.5 million in expenses to support\noperations during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and a decrease of $1.2 million in working capital.\n33\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities was $61.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $23.0\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The $38.8 million increase in cash used in investing activities was attributable to an increase in purchases\nof property and equipment, including procurement of BB satellite materials.\nFinancing activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $325.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to cash provided by financing activities\nof $63.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The $262.1 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was attributable to an\nadditional $139.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Convertible Notes, a $51.2 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of Class A\nCommon Stock from public offerings, a $72.3 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of Class A Common Stock under the ATM Equity Program,\noffset by a $1.2 million increase in taxes paid for stock-based compensation awards.\nImpact of inflation\nWhile inflation may impact our capital and operating expenditures, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial\ncondition have not been significant. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially\nimpacted by inflation in the future, including by heightened levels of inflation experienced globally as a consequence of the rapidly changing market and\neconomic conditions.\nFunding Requirements\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months from the date\nhereof. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward-looking\nstatement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be\nwrong, and we could expend capital resources sooner than we expect.\nFuture capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n• Establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and quality,\nproducts and services to support our satellite development;\n• Technological or manufacturing difficulties, design issues or other unforeseen matters;\n• Negotiation of launch agreements (including launch costs), launch delays or failures, deployment failures, or in-orbit satellite failures;\n• Seeking and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n• Timing of the launch of our satellites and subsequent initiation of service in various markets, delays in which will result in increased\noperating expenses;\n• Addressing any competing technological and market developments;\n• Ability to adjust our expenditures and contractual commitments based on capital availability;\n• Ability to operate under the covenants in our debt agreements; and\n• Attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance cash needs through a combination of\nequity offerings, debt financings, commercial and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or\nconvertible debt securities, the ownership interest of stockholders will be, or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or\nother preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that\ninclude covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring\ndividends.\nIf we raise funds through commercial agreements, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our\ntechnologies and/or future revenue streams, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock.\nAlso, our ability to raise necessary financing could be impacted by recent geopolitical events, higher interest rates and inflationary economic conditions and\ntheir effects on the market conditions. If we are unable to raise additional funds\n34\nthrough equity offerings, debt financings or commercial arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our\ncommercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market other services even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market these services\nourselves or potentially discontinue operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates (U.S. GAAP). Preparation of the financial statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the\nreported amount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment,\nestimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of\ndifferent judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. For a\ndiscussion of our critical accounting policies, see “Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2024.\n35\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and are not\nrequired to provide the information otherwise required under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange\nAct Rule 13a–15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded\nthat the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n36\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated. In\nthe opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of any\nrecorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management\nconsiders the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for\namounts in excess of management’s expectations, our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely\naffected. Refer to Note 7: Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nfor further information.\nDelaware Class Action Litigations\nFollowing books and records demands pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220, two stockholders filed putative class action complaints in the Delaware Court of\nChancery against the Company, certain current and former directors and officers of the Company and its predecessor entity and manager, New\nProvidence Acquisition Corp. and New Providence Management LLC, and Abel Avellan, alleging claims of breach of fiduciary duties, aiding and\nabetting such breaches, and unjust enrichment, relating to the de-SPAC merger. The first of those complaints, Taylor v. Coleman, et al. (C.A. No.\n2023-1292), was filed on December 27, 2023, and the second, Drulias v. New Providence Management LLC, et al., was filed on March 29, 2024\n(collectively, the “Delaware Stockholder Class Actions”). On March 15, 2024, prior to the filing of the Drulias action, the defendants had moved to\ndismiss the Taylor action. On April 29, 2024, the court entered a stipulation by the parties to both actions to be consolidated under the caption In re\nAST SpaceMobile, Inc. Stockholders Litigation (C.A. No. 2023-1292), and for the plaintiffs to file a consolidated amended complaint by May 29,\n2024. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on May 29, 2024, which asserts the same claims and seeks the same damages—equitable relief and\nunspecified monetary damages. On July 15, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint.\nFederal Class Action Litigations\nThe Company and certain of its current executive officers have been named as defendants in a putative stockholder class action lawsuit pending in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The action is styled Klarkowski v. AST SpaceMobile, Inc., No. 7:24-cv-00102-DC-\nRCG (W.D. Tex.) (the “Securities Class Action”). The complaint in the Securities Class Action, which was filed on April 17, 2024, alleges that\ndefendants violated the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and misleading statements and omissions relating\nto the status and timeline of satellite production, and that the current executive officers named as defendants are control persons under Section 20(a) of\nthe Exchange Act. The complaint is filed on behalf of shareholders who purchased shares of the Company’s common stock between November 14,\n2023 and April 1, 2024 (“Class Period”), and seeks monetary damages on behalf of the purported class. On July 9, 2024, the Court appointed a Lead\nPlaintiff for the putative class and approved his choice of Lead Counsel. The deadline for Lead Plaintiff to file his consolidated amended complaint is\nSeptember 9, 2024, and the deadline for defendants to move to dismiss, answer, or otherwise respond to the consolidated amended complaint is\nNovember 8, 2024.\nThe Company has been named as a nominal defendant and certain of its current and former executive officers and directors have been named as\ndefendants in a derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The action is styled Hanna v. Avellan,\net al., No. 7:24-cv-00171-DC-RCG (W.D. Tex.) (the “Derivative Action”). The complaint in the Derivative Action, which was filed on July 23, 2024,\nasserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and violations of the Exchange Act\nagainst all defendants and claims for contribution under the federal securities laws against certain of the defendants. The deadline for the defendants to\nmove to dismiss, answer, or otherwise respond to the complaint in the Derivative Action is September 30, 2024.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nAs of June 30, 2024, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nPursuant to the Convertible Security Investment Agreement which we entered into with certain investors, we issued Convertible Notes for an\naggregate principal amount of $110.0 million on January 16, 2024 to AT&T, Google, and Vodafone, and for an aggregate principal amount of $35.0\nmillion on May 23, 2024 to Verizon. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50%\n37\nper year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, beginning on June 30, 2024. We have the option to pay interest\non the Convertible Notes in cash or in kind. We have elected to pay interest on the Convertible Notes in kind on June 30, 2024, resulting in the\nprincipal amount of the Convertible Notes being increased by approximately $3.0 million. Interest will accrue on such increased principal amount in\nsubsequent interest periods. The AT&T, Google and Vodafone Convertible Notes have a ten-year term unless earlier converted and the Verizon\nConvertible Notes have a 9 years and 9 months term unless earlier converted. The net proceeds of the Convertible Notes are expected to be used for\ngeneral corporate purposes.\nThe Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert the Convertible Notes (subject to certain exceptions) at an initial conversion rate of 173.9130\nshares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $5.75 per share of\nClass A Common Stock). The Holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option on the Conversion Date, which is on or after January 16,\n2025. On or after the Conversion Date, we may require the Holders to convert the Convertible Notes (subject to certain exceptions), at an initial\nconversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion\nprice of $5.75 per share of Class A Common Stock) at our option, if the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130% of the\nconversion price then in effect for 30 consecutive trading days, on the immediately succeeding trading day after the last trading day of such 30 day\nperiod. The Convertible Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default and fundamental change.\nThe Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot Applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nIn the quarter ended June 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated a plan for\nthe purchase or sale of our securities intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement for the purchase or sale of our securities, within the meaning of Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\n38\nItem 6.

          "content": "Transforming how\nthe world connects\nNASDAQ: ASTS\nBusiness Update – Fourth Quarter 2023\nApril 1, 2024\nast-science.com\nForward Looking Statements\nThe information in this presentation and the oral statements made in connection therewith includes “forward-looking statements” for the purposes of federal securities laws\nthat are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other\nthan statements of historical fact in this presentation and the oral statements made in connection therewith regarding AST SpaceMobile, Inc.’s, collectively with its\nsubsidiaries (“SpaceMobile” or the “Company”), financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking\nstatements. Words such as “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “seek” and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such\nforward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management’s current beliefs, based on information\ncurrently available. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the\nforward-looking statements. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking\nstatements, please refer to the Risk Factors contained in AST SpaceMobile’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The Company’s securities filings\ncan be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or\nobligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted operating expense is an alternative financial measure used by management to evaluate our operating performance as a supplement to our most directly\ncomparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted operating expense as Total operating expenses adjusted to exclude amounts of stock-based compensation\nexpense and depreciation and amortization expense. We believe Adjusted operating expenses is a useful measure across time in evaluating the Company's operating\nperformance as we use Adjusted operating expenses to manage the business, including in preparing our annual operating budget and financial projections. Adjusted\noperating expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and therefore has limits in its usefulness to investors.\nBecause of the non-standardized definition, it may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented solely to provide\ninvestors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for its\nmost directly comparable GAAP measure of Total operating expenses.\nIndustry and Market Data\nThis presentation includes market data and other statistical information from sources believed to be reliable, including independent industry publications, governmental\npublications or other published independent sources. Although AST SpaceMobile believes these sources are reliable, we have not independently verified the information\nand cannot guarantee its accuracy and completeness.\nTrademarks and Trade Names\nAST SpaceMobile owns or has rights to various trademarks, service marks and trade names that they use in connection with the operation of their respective businesses.

These non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning\nprescribed by U.S. GAAP, and therefore have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-\nstandardized definitions, these measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of\nother companies and are presented solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully\nunderstand how management assesses performance. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as,\na substitute for their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables\naccompanying this press release.\nConference Call Information\nAST SpaceMobile will hold a quarterly business update conference call at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on\nMonday, April 1, 2024.

Business\nOur Company\nWe are building the first and only global Cellular Broadband network in space designed to be accessible directly by everyday smartphones (2G/4G-\nLTE/5G devices) for commercial use, and other applications for government use utilizing our extensive intellectual property (“IP”) and patent\nportfolio. Our SpaceMobile Service is being designed to provide cost-effective, high-speed Cellular Broadband services to end-users who are out of\nterrestrial cellular coverage using existing mobile devices. The SpaceMobile Service currently is planned to be provided by a constellation of high-\npowered, large phased-array satellites in LEO using low band and middle band spectrum controlled by MNOs.\nWe intend to work with MNOs to offer the SpaceMobile Service to the MNOs’ end-user customers. Our vision is that users will not need to\nsubscribe to the SpaceMobile Service directly through us, nor will they need to purchase any new or additional equipment or mobile device. Instead,\nusers will be able to access the SpaceMobile Service when prompted on their mobile device that they are no longer within range of the land-based\nfacilities of the MNO operator and will be able to purchase a plan directly with their existing mobile provider. We intend to seek to use a revenue-\nsharing business model for SpaceMobile Service in our agreements with MNOs.\nThe SpaceMobile Service is expected to be highly attractive to MNOs as it will enable them to improve and differentiate their service offering\nwithout significant incremental capital investments. The SpaceMobile Service is expected to enable MNOs to augment and extend their coverage\nwithout building towers or other land-based infrastructure, including where it is not cost-justified or is difficult due to geographical challenges. As a\nresult of the incremental coverage created by the planned SpaceMobile Service, we believe that MNOs will have the opportunity to increase\nsubscribers’ average revenue per user (“ARPU”) and enhance their return on invested capital.\nOn April 1, 2019, we launched our first test satellite, BlueWalker 1 (“BW1”), which was used to validate our satellite to cellular architecture and\nwas capable of managing communications delays from LEO and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-\nLTE protocol.\nWe launched our BlueWalker 3 (“BW3”) test satellite on September 10, 2022, and announced the completion of the deployment of the\ncommunication phased array antenna of the BW3 test satellite in orbit on November 14, 2022. On April 25, 2023, we announced that we had\nsuccessfully completed two-way voice calls directly to standard unmodified smartphones using the BW3 test satellite. On June 21, 2023, we\nannounced that we had achieved repeated successful 4G download speeds of above 10 megabits per second (“Mbps”) to standard unmodified\nsmartphones using the BW3 test satellite. On September 19, 2023, we announced that we had achieved repeated successful two-way voice calls\ndirectly to standard unmodified smartphones using 5G connectivity and successful download speeds of approximately 14 Mbps utilizing 5\nmegahertz (“Mhz”) of low band spectrum via the BW3 test satellite. We intend to continue testing capabilities of the BW3 test satellite, including\nfurther testing with cellular service providers and devices.\nWe are currently in the advanced stages of assembling and testing our first generation of commercial BB satellites (“Block 1 BB satellites”). We are\nleveraging skills, know-how and technological expertise derived from the design and assembly of our BW3 test satellite in the development and\nassembly of our BB satellite platform. The Block 1 BB satellites will be of similar size and weight to the BW3 test satellite, includes our own\ndesigned array solar panels and battery systems, and will have ten times higher throughput than the BW3 test satellite.\nWe currently estimate we will transport the five Block 1 BB satellites from our assembly facilities to the launch site between July and August of\n2024 to await a launch window. This launch window will be disclosed once a window can be agreed upon. The exact timing of the new launch\nschedule will be contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of assembly, integrating and testing of the\nsatellites, regulatory approvals, launch provider availability, logistics, weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe have a contractual right under the launch services agreement to reschedule the date of our dedicated launch, subject to the launch vehicle\nprovider’s launch schedule availability and payment of a change fee.\n1\nWe have commenced planning and procurement activities to begin the assembly, integration and testing of our second generation of commercial BB\nsatellites (“Block 2 BB satellites). The Block 2 BB satellites are expected to be approximately 2,400 square feet in size, almost 3.5 times bigger than\nthe Block 1 BB satellites, and will have the largest phased array ever deployed in a LEO for commercial use exceeding the phased array of the BW3\ntest satellite and planned Block 1 BB satellites. We expect that the Block 2 BB satellites will benefit from the advantages of a larger aperture array\nand our own AST 5000 Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”) chip. We believe the larger aperture array is expected to provide greater\nspectrum reuse, enhanced signal strength and increased capacity while ASIC chip is expected to enable materially greater throughput capacity of up\nto 40 MHz per beam to support up to 120 Mbps peak data rates and up to 10,000 MHz of processing bandwidth per Block 2 BB satellite, require\nless power and offer a lower overall unit cost. We have completed the design and have commenced the tape-out of our ASIC chip in March 2024.\nThe first Block 2 BB satellite will be based on a field-programmable gate array (“FPGA”) chip and future Block 2 BB satellites will use the ASIC\nchip. We have entered into an agreement with a launch service provider to launch the first Block 2 BB satellite. The agreement has a launch window\nof December 15, 2024 to March 31, 2025. The exact timing of this launch is contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely\ncompletion of the design, assembly and testing of the Block 2 BB satellite, regulatory approvals, availability of launch windows by the launch\nproviders, logistics, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We have a contractual right under the launch services agreement to\nreschedule the date of our dedicated launch, subject to the launch vehicle provider’s launch schedule availability.\nWe are headquartered in Texas where we operate 185,000 square feet of satellite assembly, integrating and testing (“AIT”) facilities and operate\nfrom multiple locations that include AIT and engineering and development locations elsewhere in the United States, India, Scotland, Spain and\nIsrael.\nCompetitive Advantage\nWe believe our planned SpaceMobile Service will have the following competitive advantages:\nLarge Addressable Market: Our planned SpaceMobile Service is aimed at providing Cellular Broadband to mobile subscribers who are constantly\nmoving in and out of coverage or live or work outside coverage, have no Cellular Broadband coverage, and have no connectivity or mobile cellular\ncoverage. According to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (“GSMA”), as of December 31, 2023, approximately 5.6 billion mobile subscribers are\nconstantly moving in and out of coverage, approximately 3.4 billion people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately 400.0 million\npeople have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage.\nDelivery of Cellular Broadband Coverage at a Competitive Cost: We believe MNOs and wireless infrastructure providers will integrate our\nCellular Broadband coverage capabilities to more cost effectively deliver wireless services in hard to reach areas and other areas that experience\ncoverage gaps as compared to existing technology. We also believe the SpaceMobile Service could be used as a back up in the event of a disruption\nof service to the MNO’s terrestrial infrastructure due to a natural disaster such as a hurricane, civil unrest or a cyberattack.\nCellular Broadband Directly to Unmodified Devices: Our large phased array, based on our innovative technology, is designed to provide high speed\nCellular Broadband including voice, text, data and video services directly to any off-the-shelf and unmodified 2G/4G-LTE/5G mobile device using\nlow and middle band cellular spectrum currently used by MNOs. This technology eliminates the need to purchase expensive, specialized equipment\nor new mobile device or to carry antennas.\nSatellites Designed for Great Functionality, Power and Redundancy: Our satellites are designed to have the largest commercial phased array ever\ndeployed in low earth orbit to provide high speed Cellular Broadband for commercial use. Our large phased array aperture is expected to provide\ngreater spectrum reuse, enhanced signal strength and increased capacity, thereby reducing the number of satellites required to achieve service\ncoverage as compared to smaller aperture satellites. Our custom developed ASIC chip is expected to enable materially greater throughput capacity,\nincluding peak data rates of up to 120 Mbps per individual spot beam when utilizing 40 MHz of spectrum and two-way back haul capacity which\ncould utilize up to 10,000 MHz of spectrum per satellite, require less power and offer a significantly lower overall unit cost. We believe our large\nphased array design and custom ASIC chip together with our expansive and technologically diverse intellectual property portfolio consisting of\n3,350 patent and patent pending claims, including innovations in the direct-to-cell satellite ecosystem from space to Earth, provide significant\ntechnological advantages to provide superior coverage and deliver high speed Cellular Broadband versus other direct to device satellite services.\nCost Advantages due to Greater Control of our Manufacturing: We believe that our significant investments in our manufacturing facilities and\nequipment, testing facilities including vibration and environment testing facilities, manufacturing processes, and supply chain provide us with a\ngreater degree of control to manufacture our satellites in a timely manner and lower the overall\n2\ncosts of our satellites. We own the IP and control the manufacturing process either internally or through third-party contract manufacturers for\napproximately 95% of all the sub-systems that will be used in our Block 2 BB satellites. We believe that having these intellectual property rights for\nthe production of sub-systems significantly reduces our dependency on individual suppliers, better secures our supply chain, and lowers the overall\ncost of our satellites.\nCapability to Support Both Commercial and Government Applications on the Same Satellite or on a Singular Infrastructure: We believe our\nsatellites will be capable of supporting both SpaceMobile Service to end users of the MNOs and a variety of applications in the government sector.\nWe believe that having satellites to support both commercial and governmental applications will enable us to better optimize and monetize the\ncapacity and capabilities of our satellites.\nOur Strategy\nWe intend to build a SpaceMobile Service which leverages our technology to provide Cellular Broadband services to MNO end-user customers\naround the world using existing mobile devices, and for government use. The principal components of our strategy include the following:\nDevelop Complementary Relationships with Mobile Network Operators. We intend on partnering with MNOs to offer the SpaceMobile Service to\ntheir end-user customers. We believe the strategy will enable our MNO partners to expand the coverage areas of their operations and increase their\ntotal addressable market with limited incremental capital investment.\nFocus on Providing Wholesale Services to Mobile Network Operators. In addition to seeking complementary relationships with MNOs, we will\nalso seek to sell our services on a wholesale basis to MNOs who then offer this capability directly to their customer base. We believe this focus will\nenable us to avoid competing with existing incumbent MNOs and reduce the complexity of our operations, thereby significantly reducing our\noverhead, marketing costs, customer acquisition costs, billing infrastructure and other customer support operations.\nModular Deployment Schedule. We plan to construct and launch satellites in phases to focus our constellation’s initial coverage on targeted\ngeographical areas that provide the most attractive opportunities. This prioritization of coverage is designed to minimize the capital required to\ninitiate commercial service and generate revenue sooner. Focusing on targeted geographical areas will also enable us to concentrate our resources on\nfewer regulatory and ground infrastructure initiatives.\nContinuing to Build and Leverage Relationships with Wireless Infrastructure Providers. We have entered into agreements with wireless\ninfrastructure partners and intend to leverage these relationships to provide the in-country ground infrastructure and telecom facilities necessary for\nour MNO partners to deliver the SpaceMobile Service to their customers. We also believe that these wireless infrastructure providers will assist us in\ndeveloping innovative financing techniques to support our infrastructure roll out and help us identify and partner with MNOs around the world.\nMaintaining our Focus on Technology and Innovation. We continue to focus on research and development to bring our SpaceMobile Service to\nmarket for commercial service to end user customers of the MNOs and for certain government applications. Our continued innovation in the\ndevelopment of our satellite system, components and related technologies and services are supported by a global engineering team of space\nscientists and consultants. We are also making steady progress in industrializing our component manufacturing and satellite assembly process to\nautomate the assembly, installation and testing of satellites. We are continuing to invest in our supply chain and expand our supplier base, increase\nthe level of vertical integration for manufacturing our BB satellites to reduce dependency on any single supplier, secure the timely supply of\nmaterials to meet the production volume of our satellites, and control costs. We protect our innovations by filing numerous patent applications and\nintellectual property registrations in the United States (“U.S.”) and worldwide. We own most of the intellectual property we use. We also\nsystematically monitor and review potential infringements on our intellectual property.\nFocus on United States Manufacturing and Intellectual Property Development Activities. Our strategy is to manufacture, assemble, integrate and\ntest our satellites primarily in our facilities in the United States. Our development of intellectual property portfolio and flight software are driven by\nour engineering and development centers in the United States. We intend upon continuing to expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio\nand register these patents in the United States. We own the IP and control the manufacturing process, either internally or with contract\nmanufacturers, for approximately 95% of the sub-systems planned to be used in our Block 2 BB satellites.\nDeveloping Relationships with Multiple Launch Vehicle Providers. We are working on developing strategic relationships with multiple launch\nvehicle providers both in the United States and outside the United States to secure launch contracts that would meet both our target launch cost and\nour planned launch timelines for the BB constellation. Our BB satellites are designed to be launched in a variety of launch vehicles.\n3\nExplore opportunities for variety of applications in government sector. We intend to leverage our patented technology, including large phased array\nand high power capability of our BB satellites, for a variety of applications in the government sector. To this end, we have entered into an agreement\nwith a prime contractor for the U.S. government to perform certain tasks and intend to seek to enter into other similar agreements with the U.S.\ngovernment or prime contractors for the U.S government.\nTechnology Development Activities\nThe industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer requirements and\ncontinuing developments in the communications and networking environment area. We believe our ability to adapt to these changes and to develop\nthe SpaceMobile Service will be an important factor in our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe conduct a majority of our engineering development activities by utilizing our global engineering team of space scientists and consultants to work\nwith us on various aspects of our satellite system development efforts. Our engineering development activities primarily take place at development\noffices located in Maryland, Scotland, Spain, India and Israel as well as at our Texas assembly and testing facilities. In addition, we utilize third-\nparty technology partners to assist in the development of our certain satellite technology.\nSatellite design\nAs part of our strategy, we aim to own and control the IP of all major sub systems of our BB satellites, and design and assemble our own\nconstellation of BB satellites. We are leveraging skills, know-how and technological expertise derived from the design and assembly of our BW3\ntest satellite in the development and assembly of our BB satellite platform. Our first generation of commercial BB satellites, Block 1 BB satellites,\nwill be of similar size and weight to the BW3 test satellite, includes our own designed array solar panels and battery systems, and will have ten times\nhigher throughput than the BW3 test satellite. Following the planned launch and deployment of five Block 1 BB satellites in 2024, we currently plan\nto initiate a limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service in targeted geographical areas, including in the United States, and seek to generate revenue\nfrom such service. Prior to initiating such service, we will need to obtain regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we would provide such\nservice and would need to enter into definitive agreements with MNOs relating to the offering of such service in each jurisdiction.\nWe believe the deployment of Block 1 BB satellites and subsequent initiation of a limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service will help to\ndemonstrate the advantages of a satellite-based Cellular Broadband service in the marketplace. This market activity may commence while we\ncontinue the development and testing of the next generation of our BB satellites.\nOur next generation of commercial BB satellites, Block 2 BB satellites, are expected to be approximately 2,400 square feet in size, almost 3.5 times\nbigger than the Block 1 BB satellites, and will have the largest phased array ever deployed in a LEO for commercial use exceeding the phased array\nof the BW3 test satellite and planned Block 1 BB satellites. We expect that the Block 2 BB satellites will benefit from the advantages of a larger\naperture array and our own ASIC chip. We believe the larger aperture array of the Block 2 BB satellites is expected to provide greater spectrum\nreuse, enhanced signal strength and increased capacity thereby reducing the number of satellites required to achieve service coverage as compared to\nsmaller aperture. We believe our ASIC chip will enable materially greater throughput capacity of up to 40 MHz per beam to support up to 120 Mbps\npeak data rates and up to 10,000 MHz of processing bandwidth per Block 2 BB satellite, require less power and offer a significantly lower overall\nunit cost. The Block 2 BB satellites are designed to provide SpaceMobile Service using both low band and middle band spectrum controlled by\nMNOs, however, the initial Block 2 BB satellites are designed to support low band spectrum only. We have entered into an agreement with a launch\nservice provider to launch the first Block 2 BB satellite during the launch window of December 15, 2024 to March 31, 2025. Pending the\ncompletion of the fabrication of our own ASIC chip, the first Block 2 BB satellite will be based on a FPGA chip. The exact timing of this launch is\ncontingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of the design, assembly and testing of the Block 2 BB satellite,\nregulatory approvals, availability of launch windows by the launch providers, logistics, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We\nhave a contractual right under the launch services agreement to reschedule the date of our dedicated launch, subject to the launch vehicle provider’s\nlaunch schedule availability.\nSatellite deployment and coverage plans\nWe are developing a phased satellite deployment plan and corresponding commercial launch plan of the SpaceMobile Service based on targeted\ngeographical areas to provide the SpaceMobile Service to the most commercially attractive MNO markets. This prioritization of coverage is\ndesigned to minimize the capital required to initiate and operate commercial service that generates\n4\ncash flows from operating activities sooner. We expect that such a successful commercial service would enable us to attract additional capital to\ncontinue to assemble and launch additional BB satellites to expand our capacity and geographic coverage area, although there can be no assurance\nthat such capital would be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe plan to achieve substantial service in the selected, targeted geographical areas with the launch and operation of 25 BB satellites and achieve\nsubstantial service in all targeted geographical areas to meet our long term business goals with the launch and operation of approximately 95 BB\nsatellites. We anticipate launching and deploying additional satellites beyond the initial 95 satellites in order to enhance coverage and system\ncapacity in response to incremental market demand. Continuous coverage is not expected to be available at all times in certain areas due to\nnumerous factors, including number of active satellites in the region, latitude coverage range, and other factors. Our current plan is subject to\nnumerous uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including satisfactory and timely completion of assembly and testing of the\nsatellites, availability of launch windows by the launch providers, our ability to raise additional capital, proposed orbits and resulting satellite\ncoverage, launch costs, ability to enter into agreements with MNOs, regulatory approvals, and other factors. We may adopt a strategy for\ncommercial launch of the SpaceMobile Service, including the nature and type of services offered and the geographic areas where we may launch\nsuch services, that may differ materially from our current plan.\nCustomers, Sales and Marketing\nWe have developed relationships with companies, such as Vodafone, Rakuten, AT&T, Google, American Tower, and others that have innovative\ntechnologies and products, skilled personnel, and potential end-user customers that complement our strategy. We believe that our business model is\nattractive to MNOs who will be able to augment and extend their Cellular Broadband coverage to customers without having to build additional\ntowers, infrastructure, or purchase additional spectrum. In addition, we believe that the SpaceMobile Service will provide MNOs the opportunity to\nincrease monthly ARPU through the sales of additional services.\nWe believe our patented technology leveraging our large phased array antenna could also be used in certain mission-critical communication\ncapabilities in the government sector. We have entered into an agreement with a prime contractor for the U.S. government to perform certain tasks\non our BW3 test satellite in orbit today and our planned next five Block 1 BB satellites.\nThe SpaceMobile Service is being designed to offer Cellular Broadband under our wholesale business model with MNOs. We expect the MNOs will\nmarket our SpaceMobile Service to their existing customers, who will be the ultimate end-users. We generally seek to negotiate a revenue-sharing\nmodel in our agreements with MNOs. To date, we have entered into over 45 preliminary agreements and understandings with MNOs. Many of these\npreliminary agreements and understandings will need to be renewed as their terms will end before we expect to launch the SpaceMobile Service.\nAlso, we will need to execute definitive commercial agreements with MNOs that will supersede these preliminary agreements and understandings\nbefore we can offer our SpaceMobile Service.\nWe expect that the MNOs will market and sell the enhanced coverage of the SpaceMobile Service directly to their customers and offer the service at\na differentiated price to the current terrestrial coverage using the following illustrative service offerings, among others.\nService Offering Service Offering Details\nDay Pass (Ad-Hoc) ● Upon leaving the terrestrial cellular coverage area, mobile subscribers will receive a\ntext on their phone asking if they would like to turn on the SpaceMobile Service.\nMonthly Add-on Subscription (Consumer) ● Subscribers can pay a fixed monthly fee to add the SpaceMobile Service as a\nsupplemental service to their current wireless plan.\n● Roaming onto the SpaceMobile Service’s network upon entering an area without cell\ntower coverage.\nMonthly Add-on Subscription (Enterprise) ● Same as monthly add-on for consumers, but with more data targeting commercial\nenterprises.\nStandalone Get Connected Plan ● In areas without cellular coverage today, subscribers will use and pay for the\nSpaceMobile Service as their primary network through an MNO partner.\nAeronautical and Maritime ● Connect end users travelling in aircraft and vessels for Cellular Broadband service.\nMilitary and Government ● Service for military and governmental operations\n5\nWe expect that the majority of our revenue will be generated from SpaceMobile Service offerings similar to those described above through revenue-\nsharing arrangements with MNOs; however, the ultimate offerings and pricing will be subject to mutual agreement with the MNOs and there can be\nno assurance as to what model any MNO ultimately offers its customers and the level of customer acceptance of these models.\nThe operation of SpaceMobile Service will require mobile traffic to be transmitted by our BB constellation and connected via high-throughput Q/V-\nband links to ground station gateways which will be collocated with the MNOs’ cellular network infrastructure. We also expect to generate revenue\nfrom the resale of gateway equipment for ground stations, installation and maintenance of ground stations, and other associated services to MNOs\nand other third parties.\nManufacturing, Assembly and Launch\nOur strategy is to control the manufacturing and supply chain of the components used in our BB satellites, and assemble, integrate and test BB\nsatellites primarily in our AIT facilities in Texas. We believe this strategy will result in a faster turn to market, greater control and lower overall\ncosts. Our primary AIT facilities include approximately 185,000 square feet facilities in Texas for assembly and testing of our BB satellites, as well\nas an approximately 10,500 square foot facility in Spain for assembly and testing of avionics components and an approximately 33,000 square foot\nfacility in Israel for assembly and testing of electronic components. We have made significant capital investments in buildings and equipment at our\nAIT facilities to manufacture satellite components at our facilities; streamline the assembly, integration and testing processes for BB satellites; and\nconduct various testing of satellites including vibration and environment testing at our facilities.\nWe utilize a range of domestic and international contract manufacturers and vendors to manufacture specific components, subsystems, software and\nother electronic components used in our BB satellites. Some components, subsystems and services necessary for the assembly of our satellites are\ncurrently obtained from a sole source supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have made investments in the design, development, and\nmanufacturing processes and own the IP design of many of these satellite components and subsystems that are either manufactured by us at our AIT\nfacilities or manufactured by third party manufacturers. In certain cases where we have invested or co-invested in the design and development of\nsatellite components and subsystems but do not own the IP design, we generally have contractual restrictions on the third party manufacturers\nprohibiting the use of these design, development, and manufacturing processes for certain number of years to supply the same or similar satellite\ncomponents and subsystems to any other third parties. We continuously aim to increase, where feasible, vertical integration for manufacturing of\nsatellite components and subsystems at our AIT facilities to reduce our dependency on suppliers, ensure timely supply of satellite components and\nsubsystems to meet our launch timeline, and lower the overall cost of BB satellites. We own the IP and control the manufacturing process, either\ninternally or with contract manufacturers, for approximately 95% of the sub-systems planned to be used in our Block 2 BB satellites.\nWe are currently in the advanced stages of assembling and testing our five Block 1 BB satellites. The completion of five Block 1 BB satellites has\nbeen delayed as compared to our target completion timeline due to a delay in the commencement of integration and testing of five Block 1 BB\nsatellites. The failure by suppliers of two key subsystems to meet their contractual delivery timelines contributed to this delay. To mitigate such risks\nin the future and reduce our dependency on these suppliers, we have reached an agreement with the supplier of one of the subsystems and obtained a\nnon-exclusive and worldwide license of the design and manufacturing rights of this subsystem for use in our Block 2 BB satellites. We have also\nreplaced the supplier of the other subsystem with a new supplier with whom we have completed a new design and own the IP of this subsystem. The\nnew supplier will manufacture and supply this subsystem for use in our Block 2 BB satellites at a cost that is expected to be materially lower than\nthe current cost of this subsystem. We expect these subsystems to not delay the timely completion of future BB satellites.\nWe currently estimate we will transport the five Block 1 BB satellites from our assembly facilities to the launch site between July and August of\n2024 to await a launch window. This launch window will be disclosed once a window can be agreed upon. The exact timing of the new launch\nschedule will be contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of assembly, integrating and testing of the\nsatellites, regulatory approvals, launch provider availability, logistics, weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe have a contractual right under the launch services agreement to reschedule the date of our dedicated launch, subject to the launch vehicle\nprovider’s launch schedule availability and payment of a change fee.\nWe are also designing and developing our own ASIC chip. We believe the introduction of ASIC chip in our Block 2 BB satellites will enable\nmaterially greater throughput capacity of up to 40 MHz per beam to support 120 Mbps peak data rates and up to 10,000 MHz of processing\nbandwidth per Block 2 BB satellite, require less power and offer a lower overall unit cost. We have invested a substantial amount in completing the\ndesign of the ASIC chip and we own the IP of our ASIC chip. We have entered into an agreement with a leading semiconductor manufacturer for\ntape-out and fabrication of our ASIC chip. The tape-out of our ASIC chip commenced in March 2024.\n6\nWe continue to make progress towards the completion of the design and development of our Block 2 BB satellites. We believe we will benefit from\nthe skills, technological expertise, and manufacturing know-how derived from the assembly and testing of our Block 1 BB satellite in the\ndevelopment and assembly of our Block 2 BB satellites. We began the design and development of the Block 2 BB satellites prior to the design and\ndevelopment of Block 1 BB satellites. We have commenced planning and procurement activities to begin the assembly, integration and testing of the\nBlock 2 BB satellites and have entered into agreements and placed orders for procurement of materials required for manufacturing the satellite\ncomponents, and subsystems required for the assembly of Block 2 BB satellites. We plan to continue to manufacture the satellite components and\nsubsystems for Block 2 BB satellites as soon as the assembly and testing of Block 1 BB satellites are complete.\nWe are actively involved in discussions with various launch vehicle providers both in the U.S and outside the U.S to secure dedicated launch for our\nBB satellites. We are working with multiple launch vehicle providers for technical assessment of accommodating maximum number of BB satellites\nin their launch vehicles. The five Block 1 BB satellites are scheduled to be launched in a dedicated launch vehicle from within the U.S. We have\nentered into an agreement with a launch service provider to launch the first Block 2 BB satellite. The agreement has a launch window of December\n15, 2024 to March 31, 2025. We generally have contractual rights in our launch agreements to reschedule the launch window or the date of the\ndedicated launch, subject to the launch vehicle provider’s launch schedule availability and payment of a change fee. The exact timing of our\nlaunches is contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of the design, assembly and testing of the BB satellites,\nregulatory approvals, availability of launch windows by the launch providers, logistics, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nGovernment Regulations\nWe are required to comply with the laws and regulations of, and often obtain approvals from, national and local authorities in connection with our\nservices. As we launch service to additional countries and regions, we will become subject to additional governmental approvals and regulations. We\nwill provide a number of services that rely on the use of radio-frequency spectrum, and the provision of such services is highly regulated. Satellites\nmust be operated in a manner consistent with the regulations and procedures of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”), a specialized\nagency of the United Nations, which require the coordination of the operation of satellite systems in certain circumstances, and more generally are\nintended to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference among different users of the radio spectrum.\nOur business is subject to extensive rules, regulations, statutes, orders and policies imposed by the government in the United States and in foreign\njurisdictions. For example, in the U.S. commercial use of radio-frequency spectrum is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications\nCommission (“FCC”) under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The FCC is responsible for authorizing the operation of commercial\nspacecraft, and also authorizes non-U.S. licensed spacecraft to be used to serve the United States. The FCC also licenses the operation of satellite\nearth stations and regulates the technical and other aspects of the operation of these facilities.\nThe SpaceMobile Service in the United States is subject to a pending Amendment to Petition for Declaratory Ruling and accompanying application\n(“Amendment Application”) before the FCC, requesting authority to launch and permit the commercial operation of a United States Non-\nGeostationary Orbit (“NGSO”) satellite system employing V-band frequencies. The Amendment Application seeks authority to utilize 248 satellites\noperating in 17 orbital planes of which 243 satellites will operate at an approximate 730-740 kilometers and the remaining five satellites will operate\nfrom a lower altitude of approximately 515-525 kilometers. The Amendment Application for satellite space station authorization is under\nconsideration by the FCC. We expect that, if approved, the FCC will apply routine conditions to a license grant authorizing launch and operation\nmilestones for the NGSO satellite system that we must comply with. If we change the operational parameters of our satellites, we will need to file a\nsupplemental application to modify our license with the FCC and obtain affirmative consent before undertaking such modifications. If we do not\nmeet the launch and operation milestones set out in our grant, once obtained, we risk losing a portion of our surety bond for failure to meet all\nmilestones.\nBecause the SpaceMobile Service will communicate with end users using satellites transmitting on spectrum traditionally licensed to MNOs, in the\nU.S. we also will need the approval of the FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, which handles terrestrial wireless licensing. We have a lease\nagreement with AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”) and complementary application to provide Supplemental Coverage from Space (“SCS”) services pending\nbefore the FCC to authorize service links to end users and anticipate that the FCC will process this application in due course after addressing the\npending Amendment Application. Other parties have indicated that they may oppose this approval on procedural and substantive grounds.\nWe have experimental licenses with the FCC that permit the testing of the BW3 test satellite in LTE frequencies in multiple locations in the United\nStates and permits the testing of V-band ground stations in Texas and Hawaii in connection therewith. We\n7\nare required to comply with operational and coordination requirements set forth as conditions to the experimental license grant. Material changes to\nthe experimental license testing parameters would require prior approval by the FCC.\nWe also will need to secure FCC authority in the future for the ground segment of the SpaceMobile Service, consisting of approximately four fixed\nearth stations located in the United States. Earth station licenses generally are granted for 15-year terms, and typically are renewed in the ordinary\ncourse. Material changes in earth station operations would require prior approval by the FCC. The operation of our earth stations is subject to\nvarious license conditions, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the FCC’s rules and regulations.\nWe are also seeking regulatory approval for fixed earth stations in other jurisdictions around the world to operate satellite earth stations in\nconnection with our service, including in connection with BW3 testing. Also, we are seeking regulatory approval to permit the commercial\noperation of our satellites using V-band and cellular frequencies in foreign jurisdictions where we intend to operate. If we are unable to obtain such\nregulatory approvals, we would not be able to operate in those jurisdictions. With respect to the BW3 test satellite, we have contracted with third\nparties to permit the usage of UHF and S-band frequencies for telemetry, tracking and control (“TT&C”) in jurisdictions outside of the United\nStates. We intend to contract with third parties for the usage of UHF and S-band frequencies in jurisdictions outside of the United States in\nconnection with the commercial operation of the SpaceMobile Service.\nThe SpaceMobile Service will also operate under filings made by the United States with the ITU to enable us to operate our satellite system. The\norbital location and frequencies for our satellites are subject to the ITU’s regulations, including its frequency registration and coordination\nprocedures, and its various provisions on spectrum usage. Those procedures are specified in the ITU Radio Regulations and seek to facilitate shared\ninternational use of limited spectrum and orbital resources in a manner that avoids harmful interference. Among other things, the ITU regulations set\nforth procedures for establishing international priority with respect to the use of such resources, deadlines for bringing satellite networks into use in\norder to maintain such priority, and coordination rights and obligations with respect to other networks, which vary depending on whether such\nnetworks have higher or lower ITU priority. Further licensing by the United States may be required if material changes to the SpaceMobile Service\nare made. We expect to register each of our satellites after launch with the United Nations Register of Objects Launched Into Outer Space.\nGovernment regulators, including the FCC, have adopted expansive views of the scope of their regulatory authority over common carriers providing\nCellular Broadband and are increasingly focused on the quality of service, customer disclosures, customer privacy, and the customer support that\nwireless carriers provide. These include, but are not limited to, common carrier obligations; universal service obligations; rules governing billing\nand the pass through of third party charges, regulations governing subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; access to E911\nand location accuracy requirements; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate\nelectronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; emergency warning requirements; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing;\noutage reporting; open Internet and Net neutrality requirements; cybersecurity and rules requiring the offering of equipment and services that are\naccessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. Although we do not currently expect that SpaceMobile will be subject to\ncommon carrier obligations and regulations, SpaceMobile’s MNO partners may be subject to the conditions described above.\nOn March 14, 2024, the FCC adopted a First Report & Order to implement a regulatory framework for SCS, which allows satellite operators to\ncollaborate with terrestrial service providers to expand coverage to terrestrial licensee subscribers. We view the initial SCS rules as creating a\nfavorable regulatory framework for the satellite-to-device services industry.\nIntellectual Property\nOur intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio is expansive and technologically diverse, containing numerous and various innovations of the direct-to-cell\nsatellite ecosystem from space to Earth. Our IP portfolio consists of 36 patent families worldwide. To date, we have secured 31 granted United\nStates patents, one of which is exclusively licensed to us, and at least 4 United States patent applications that have been indicated as allowable and\nready for issue pending completion of patent office formalities. We also have approximately 31 currently pending United States patent applications.\nMoreover, we have secured 9 granted international patents providing protection in 17 different countries, including Europe, Australia, Canada, India,\nJapan, and South Korea, and 4 patent applications in Australia and South Korea that have been indicated as allowable and ready for issue pending\ncompletion of patent office formalities. We have approximately 72 pending international patent applications in the countries noted above as well as\nunder the Patent Cooperation Treaty. In total, as of April 1, 2024, we have more than 3,350 patent and patent pending claims worldwide, of which\napproximately 1,050 have been officially granted or allowed.\n8\nWe seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks,\ntrade secrets and contractual rights. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information through nondisclosure policies, the use\nof appropriate confidentiality agreements and other security measures. We maintain IP infringement enforcement and defense insurance (current\ncoverage of $7.0 million for defending infringement claims and $10.0 million to bring offensive infringement claims). We have filed or registered a\nnumber of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries and have a number of patent filings pending. There can be no\nassurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced against competitors or competitive products in any particular jurisdiction.\nAlthough we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contracts has incredible value, the rapidly\nchanging technology in the satellite and wireless communications industries and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success\ndependent on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees.\nCertain of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or\nrenew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses\ngenerally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be\navailable on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and related litigation regarding patent\nand other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or\ncircumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant, or that our rights will give us a competitive\nadvantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nCompetition\nThe mobile satellite services industry at-large is highly competitive but has significant barriers to entry, including the cost and difficulty associated\nwith successfully developing, building and launching a satellite network and obtaining various governmental and regulatory approvals. In addition\nto cost, there is a significant amount of lead time associated with obtaining the required licenses, building and launching the satellite constellation,\nand developing and deploying the ground network technology. We currently face competition from other service providers that offer a range of\nmobile and fixed communications options. There are also a number of competitors working to develop innovative solutions to compete in this\nindustry, many of which are more established providers or have significantly greater resources than we do. In addition, while we view our services\nas largely complementary to terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks through our MNO partnerships, we also compete with them\nindirectly.\nWe face competition from existing service providers such as Inmarsat, Globalstar, ORBCOMM, Thuraya Telecommunications Co. and Iridium\nCommunications that offer a range of mobile and fixed communications options. In the case of fixed broadband operators, a VSAT end-user\nterminal is used to provide service while with mobile satellite service providers a special purpose satellite phone is required. In addition, we face\ncompetition from companies developing new LEO networks such as SpaceX’s Starlink, OneWeb and Amazon’s Kuiper. In 2023, Apple introduced a\nnew service supported by Globalstar which provides SOS Emergency Service capabilities to its latest generation iPhones. In September 2022,\nSpaceX and T-Mobile US announced that they plan to offer a text based service from a constellation that will be built in the future. We believe the\nplanned SpaceMobile Service will compete with the direct to device segment of the mobile satellite service sector by providing the ability to support\nCellular Broadband data rates, utilize existing unmodified handsets and operate in virtually all of the low to mid band spectrums used by MNOs\ntoday. In comparison, the mobile satellite service LEOs are designed to support low data rate applications such as SOS, texting and in some\ninstances, voice.\nWe also compete with regional mobile satellite communications services in several geographic markets. In these cases, the majority of our\ncompetitors’ customers require regional, not global, mobile voice and data services, so competitors may present a viable alternative to the\nSpaceMobile Service. These regional competitors operate or plan to operate geostationary satellites. In some markets, we compete directly or\nindirectly with very small aperture terminal operators that offer communications services through private networks using very small aperture\nterminals or hybrid systems to target business users. We also compete indirectly with terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks and\nto the extent that terrestrial communications companies invest in underdeveloped areas, we may face increased competition in those areas.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those governing\nthe management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, such as fuels and batteries, which may contain hazardous materials. Certain\nenvironmental laws, such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and\n9\nLiability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on persons who\ndisposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment, including at third-party sites or offsite disposal locations, or those who currently\nown or operate (or formerly owned or operated) sites where such a release occurred. In addition to clean-up actions brought by federal, state, local\nand foreign governmental entities, private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or exposure to,\nhazardous materials on, from or otherwise relating to such a property.\nAlso, our operation of satellites will be regulated by various jurisdictions over which our satellites will travel, as well as those jurisdictions in which\nwe enter or return to the earth’s atmosphere and land (including through unintentional landings), though complete destructive atmosphere reentry of\neach satellite is anticipated. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of violations\nof or in connection with liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 489 employees and consultants worldwide, which included approximately 272 employees and\nconsultants in the U.S. and approximately 217 in other jurisdictions, primarily Scotland, Spain, India and Israel. We view the strength of our\nleadership team and our talented colleagues around the world as a critical component of our future success. In certain countries in which we operate,\nwe are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements, which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective\nbargaining agreements. None of our U.S. employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreement. Generally, each employee is required to sign\na confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-use agreement with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our\nemployees to be good.\nWe consider our talent to be very important to our operations and execution of our business strategy as well as the overall success of our business.\nOur key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent, while integrating diversity, equity\nand inclusion principles and practices into our core values. As such, we invest significant management attention, time and resources to attract,\nengage, develop and retain our talent. Our talent strategy focuses on our employee training and development, diversity and inclusion and the overall\nwell-being and safety of our talent.\nWe have ongoing training and development programs to enable employees to further refine and develop their skills. We provide access and make\ntraining and development programs available to our employees which include technical programs, regulatory and compliance, business\ncommunications and leadership development.\nWe seek to attract a diverse population of employees by using a wide variety of recruiting platforms, such as online job portals, recruiters, in-person\njob fairs, local university training and recruitment programs, and employee referrals. We encourage training and development of our employees and\nprovide on-the-job training and online platforms and mandate training for all our employees on topics of diversity, equity and inclusion.\nOur success depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train, develop, and maintain our employees’ well-being. Our ability\nto hire, attract and retain employees depends on our ability to provide competitive total compensation. Our compensation and benefit packages are\ndesigned to attract and retain employees and align the employees’ interests with our long-term success. We seek to align the interests of our\nemployees and stockholders by providing long-term incentive programs such as awards of stock-based compensation to most of our employees. We\ngenerally make available the following benefits for our employees, including, but not limited to, a 401(k) retirement savings plan for our United\nStates based employees, health insurance, flexible spending accounts, life insurance, long- and short-term disability, paid vacation, paid time off for\nholidays, sick time, and parental leave.\nWe are committed to providing a safe working environment for our employees. Our engineering and manufacturing facilities have injury prevention\nprograms, and our procedures emphasize the need for the cause of injuries to be investigated and for action plans to be implemented to mitigate\npotential recurrence.\nKey Wireless Infrastructure Provider Relationships\nWe have relationships with various wireless infrastructure providers. A summary of certain commercial relationships with wireless infrastructure\nproviders is below.\n10\nVodafone\nWe and Vodafone have agreed to enter into one or more definitive agreements for a commercial partnership that is anticipated to use the\nSpaceMobile Service (the “Vodafone Commercial Agreements”). In connection with the commercial agreements, we have agreed that we, our\nsubsidiaries, and affiliates would not enter into any agreement, term sheet, or letter of intent that grants another party the rights related to the\nprovision of mobile services in the Vodafone markets or Vodafone partner markets prior to the execution of the Vodafone Commercial Agreements.\nThe Vodafone Commercial Agreements are expected to include mutual exclusivity, conditioned upon Vodafone making the SpaceMobile Service\navailable to all of its customers and certain promotional efforts, within all specified Vodafone markets for five years commencing on the launch of a\ncommercial service in all of the specified Vodafone markets; preferential commercial terms in Vodafone partner markets; 50/50 revenue share for\nthe SpaceMobile Service in Vodafone exclusivity markets; and the procurement, building and operating of mobile network ground stations at a\nmutually agreed cost by Vodafone. No payments have been made to date between us and Vodafone pursuant to the anticipated Vodafone\nCommercial Agreements. Vodafone has the right to designate one individual to our Board of Directors. Currently, Vodafone’s designee is Luke\nIbbetson, Head of Group Research & Development, Vodafone.\nWe entered into a side letter with Vodafone dated December 15, 2020, under which we have agreed (i) not to enter into any material corporate\nstrategic relationship or material commercial agreement with a party other than Vodafone and its affiliates that would be reasonably expected to\nmaterially frustrate our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements with certain exceptions; (ii) to allocate\nsufficient funds in the capital budget to facilitate compliance with our obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements; and (iii) not to alter\nour business plan in a manner that is materially detrimental to our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements.\nThe letter agreement entered into on January 16, 2024 between Vodafone and us provides, among other things, for an initial revenue commitment of\n$25.0 million to us to be paid by Vodafone over a two and a half year period to be defined in a future definitive agreement for us to provide\nconnectivity services. Also, Vodafone submitted a purchase order for network equipment from us to support planned commercial service.\nAmerican Tower\nWe and American Tower have entered into a side letter agreement that was subsequently amended and restated on December 15, 2020 to reflect the\ntransactions and agreements contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement between us and New Providence Acquisition Corp. (“NPA”) (the\n“Amended and Restated Letter Agreement”). The Amended and Restated Letter Agreement contemplates that we and American Tower will enter\ninto commercial agreements to allow us to use American Tower facilities for our terrestrial gateway facilities in certain markets. The term of the\noperational agreement between us and American Tower is for an anticipated five years after the initial launch of commercial mobile services by us.\nOn March 22, 2022, we and American Tower entered into a non-binding term sheet reflecting the terms and conditions for the deployment of our\ngateway satellite technology equipment on property owned and operated by American Tower. Under the agreement, American Tower will provide us\nleased space and managed services at its current and future tower sites and data centers under the global master lease agreements to be entered into\nby the parties.\nThe usage of any American Tower services in a Vodafone market will be memorialized in a commercial agreement among all three parties. In\nmarkets where Vodafone does not operate (“Carrier Neutral Markets”), we and American Tower may enter into an agreement for American Tower to\nmanage the operation of our deployed gateway facility in such market. In Carrier Neutral Markets where we require a third party to provide a\ngateway facility or services, we agree to not accept any bid that is inferior to American Tower’s best and final proposal for such gateway facility or\nservices. We also agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to utilize American Tower facilities in (i) Vodafone markets where Vodafone decides\nto not use its facilities, (ii) in Carrier Neutral Markets, and (iii) instances where we require a third-party vendor.\nAdditionally, we will work with American Tower to evaluate and plan gateway facility and radio access network data center deployments with\npreferred vendor status to offer carrier-neutral hosting facilities in certain equatorial markets. American Tower will serve as the preferred vendor for\ncarrier neutral hosting facilities. We will pay American Tower a monthly connection fee for use of a carrier neutral hosting facility, which we expect\nwill be charged back to each applicable MNO. If we and American Tower agree to construct a new carrier neutral hosting facility or improve an\nexisting one and American Tower elects to fund all such capital expenditures, American Tower will provide AST with a fair-market, long-term lease\nto such facility. No payments have been made to date between us and American Tower under the Amended and Restated Letter Agreement.\nAmerican Tower has the\n11\nright to designate one individual to our Board of Directors. Currently, American Tower’s designee is Ed Knapp, Chief Technology Officer,\nAmerican Tower.\nRakuten\nOn February 4, 2020, we entered into a commercial agreement with Rakuten, for the development of exclusive network capabilities in Japan\ncompatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates, which agreement was amended and restated as of December 15, 2020 (the\n“Rakuten Agreement”). Under the terms of the Rakuten Agreement, we agreed to make investments in building network capabilities in Japan that\nare compatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates. Furthermore, we will collaborate with Rakuten to ensure network capability\nwith Rakuten’s licensed frequencies, including full coverage in Japan with 3GPP Band 3 frequencies with MIMO capability. Upon the launch of\nsuch coverage, Rakuten will receive unlimited, exclusive rights and usage capacity in Japan in exchange for a $0.5 million annual maintenance fee\npayable to us or our successors. Furthermore, we will make $5.0 million (or such lesser amount as mutually agreed upon the parties) in capital\ninvestments towards the design, assembly, acquisition and implementation of ground communication assets. We and Rakuten will receive unlimited\nrights and usage of the ground assets for their respective operations, including, but not limited to, satellite and other telecommunication\ncommunications. The term of the Rakuten Agreement shall remain in effect until we fulfil our obligations under the Rakuten Agreement. Rakuten\nhas the right to designate two individuals to our Board of Directors. Currently, Rakuten has designated Hiroshi Mikitani, Founder, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, Rakuten, Inc. as a director and has the right to designate another individual.\nAT&T\nWe and AT&T entered into a letter agreement on January 16, 2024, pursuant to which AT&T will make a non-refundable $20.0 million commercial\npayment for prepaid service revenue, creditable against future service revenue of AST LLC, due after the launch and successful initial operation of\nthe first five commercial satellites. AT&T also submitted a purchase order under a separate agreement for purchase of network equipment from AST\nLLC to support planned commercial service.\nUnder the letter agreement, we are required to use reasonable best efforts to cause our Stockholders’ Agreement, dated April 6, 2021 to be amended\nsuch that AT&T Services shall have the right to nominate, and the parties to such Stockholders’ Agreement agree to vote for and cause the\nappointment of, a representative of AT&T Services that it determines in its sole discretion to (i) serve as a non-voting observer to our board of\ndirectors or (ii) serve as a director to our board of directors, subject to the director nominee satisfying any established standards for direct\nqualification and selection, including compliance with applicable laws.\nGoogle\nAST LLC has entered into a letter agreement on January 16, 2024 with Google, LLC (“Google”) whereby the parties will negotiate and execute a\ndefinitive agreement to provide, among other things, certain services to each other and have agreed to collaborate on product development, testing\nand implementation plans for SpaceMobile network connectivity on Android devices.\n12\nAvailable Information\nOur Company's internet website address is www.ast-science.com. We file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual\nReports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the\nSEC. We also make available on that website, and in print, if any stockholder or other person so requests, our “Code of Business Conduct and\nEthics” applicable to all employees and Directors. Any changes to our Code of Ethics will be posted on that website. In addition, the SEC maintains\na website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.\n13\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks that are not\ncurrently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur SpaceMobile Service is in development and may not be completed on time or at all and the costs associated with it may be greater than\nexpected.\nCosts of the design, assembly, integration, testing and launch of satellites and related components and ground infrastructure, as well as operating\ncosts, are substantial. There can be no assurance that we will complete the SpaceMobile Service and related infrastructure, products and services on\na timely basis, on budget or at all. Design, assembly and launch of satellite systems are highly complex and historically have been subject to\nfrequent delays and cost over-runs. For example, the BW3 launch was delayed, the BW3 development costs exceeded initial estimates and BW3\ntesting took longer than expected; launch of Block 1 BB satellites was delayed. Development of the SpaceMobile Service, which is utilizing new\ntechnology, may continue to suffer from delays, interruptions or increased costs due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control,\nincluding:\n• the failure of the SpaceMobile Service to work as expected as a result of technological or manufacturing and assembling difficulties, design\nissues or other unforeseen matters;\n• lower than anticipated demand and acceptance for the SpaceMobile Service and mobile satellite services in general;\n• the inability to obtain capital in the public and private markets to finance the SpaceMobile Service and related infrastructure, products and\nservices on acceptable terms or at all;\n• engineering and/or manufacturing performance failing or falling below expected levels of output or efficiency;\n• denial or delays in receipt of regulatory approvals or non-compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities;\n• the breakdown or failure of equipment or systems;\n• the inability to reach commercially viable agreements with launch providers that can accommodate the technical specifications of our\nsatellites, proposed orbits and resulting satellite coverage, and proposed launch timing;\n• launch costs which may exceed our estimates;\n• non-performance by third-party contractors or suppliers;\n• the inability to develop or license necessary technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n• launch delays or failures or deployment failures or in-orbit satellite failures once launched;\n• the inability to reach commercially viable cooperative agreements to license spectrum with one or more MNOs;\n• the inability to negotiate agreements with mobile network operators relating to the SpaceMobile Service that would supersede memoranda of\nunderstanding;\n• labor disputes or disruptions in labor productivity or the unavailability of skilled labor;\n• increases in the costs of materials or services, including due to inflation;\n• changes in project scope;\n• increased competition including competitors who may have more resources than we do;\n• additional requirements imposed by changes in laws or regulations;\n• geopolitical events, such as the outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as related sanctions and other trade restrictions;\n• pandemics, epidemics or other global public health events; or\n14\n• severe weather or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, storms (including space storms and adverse weather in space) or explosions.\nIf any of the above events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to develop the SpaceMobile Service and related\ninfrastructure, products and services, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will need to raise additional funds for continued operations and to initiate our planned SpaceMobile Service. These funds may not be\navailable to us when we need them on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when needed, our operations and prospects\nwill be negatively affected.\nWe currently estimate we will need to raise additional capital of approximately $350.0 million to $400.0 million for operating and capital\nexpenditures to design, assemble and launch 20 Block 2 BB satellites and operate a constellation of 25 BB satellites. We intend to seek to raise\nadditional capital prior to the commencement of the commercial services through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities (secured or\nunsecured), secured or unsecured loans or other debt facilities, and credit from government or financial institutions or commercial partners,\nincluding through our existing Equity Line of Credit and the ATM Equity Program (as defined in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources”). We also intend to seek to draw the remaining available credit\nunder the Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-\nLiquidity and Capital Resources”). Our ability to access the capital markets during this period of volatility may require us to modify our current\nexpectations. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds\nwhen needed in the future, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will incur significant expenses and capital expenditures in the future to execute our business plan and develop the SpaceMobile Service, and\nwe may be unable to adequately forecast or control our expenses.\nWe will incur significant expenses and capital expenditures in the future to further our business plan and develop the SpaceMobile Service,\nincluding expenses to:\n• design, develop, assemble and launch our satellites;\n• design and develop the components of the SpaceMobile Service;\n• conduct research and development;\n• purchase raw materials and components;\n• launch and test our systems;\n• expand our design, development, maintenance and repair capabilities;\n• costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights; and\n• increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.\nBecause we will incur much of the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any revenues with respect thereto, our losses in future\nperiods will be significant. Also, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in\nrevenues, which would further increase our losses. Our ability to become profitable in the future will not only depend on our ability to successfully\nlaunch satellites and build the SpaceMobile Service, but also to control costs. If we are unable to efficiently design, assemble, launch and service our\nsatellites or experience significant delays during such development, our potential margins, potential profitability and prospects would be materially\nand adversely affected.\nWe are an early stage company with a history of losses and may never become profitable.\nWe incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and have incurred net losses\nattributable to common stockholders of approximately $189.7 million from our inception through December 31, 2023. To date, we have not\ngenerated any revenues from our SpaceMobile Service. All past revenues were generated from sales and services by our former subsidiary,\nNanoAvionika UAB (“Nano”). Following the completion of the sale of Nano on September 6, 2022, we did not generate any revenue.\n15\nWe will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin generating revenue as a result of planned launches of\nour commercial satellites and may continue to incur operating or net losses even after we begin generating revenue. The likelihood of success of our\nbusiness plan must be considered in light of the substantial challenges, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in\nconnection with developing and expanding early-stage businesses and the competitive environment in which we operate. The development of a\nsatellite-based Cellular Broadband network and related intellectual property is a speculative undertaking, involves a substantial degree of risk, is a\ncapital-intensive business and may ultimately fail. If we cannot successfully execute our plan to develop a Cellular Broadband network from LEO\nsatellites, referred to as SpaceMobile Service, our business will not succeed.\nOur potential profitability is dependent upon the successful development and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of SpaceMobile\nService, which may not occur. Even if we are able to successfully develop our SpaceMobile Service, there can be no assurance that it will be\ncommercially successful and become profitable on a sustained basis, if at all. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in expenses and\ncapital expenditures, some of which could be significant, due to research, development, manufacturing and assembly expenses and the investments\nrequired to design, assemble and launch the SpaceMobile Service constellation.\nWe will rely on MNOs and require regulatory approvals to access the spectrum the SpaceMobile Service needs to operate.\nUnlike traditional mobile satellite services, the SpaceMobile Service is not being designed to deliver service over spectrum allocated for mobile\nsatellite use. Rather, the SpaceMobile Service is being designed to deliver service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use. To do so,\nregulators in each country where we will offer the SpaceMobile Service will need to approve the SpaceMobile Service’s use of spectrum in this\nmanner. We cannot be sure that these regulatory approvals will be forthcoming or, if received, that they will be issued in a timely manner and on\nterms and conditions that will allow us to meet our business plan. We will also need to reach commercial agreements with MNOs under which they\nwill agree to provide us with access to their licensed spectrum on suitable terms and conditions. We cannot be sure that such agreements can be\nreached or that the terms of such agreements will allow us to provide the SpaceMobile Service for a sufficient period of time or on terms and\nconditions that will allow us to meet our business plan.\nWe have a limited operating history and operate in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future\nprospects and increases the risk of your investment.\nFormed in May 2017, we have a limited operating history in the satellite communications industry, which is rapidly evolving. As a result, there is\nlimited information on which investors can base an evaluation of our business, strategy, operating plan, results and prospects. We intend to derive\nsubstantially all of our revenues from the SpaceMobile Service, which is still in the beginning stages of development. There are also no assurances\nthat we will be able to secure future business with, or to convert existing memoranda of understanding into definitive commercial agreements with,\nMNOs, who are in turn expected to market and sell the SpaceMobile Service to their existing customers as the end-user.\nIt is difficult to predict future revenues and expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. We are a pre-\nrevenue company facing substantial business and operational risks, including a relatively untested market strategy, all of which makes forecasting\nfuture business results particularly difficult and results in a significant level of execution risk.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan will depend on a number of factors outside of our control.\nThe success of our business plan is dependent on a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n• the ability to maintain the functionality, capacity and control of the SpaceMobile Service and satellite network once launched;\n• the ability to access MNO or other spectrum on suitable terms to us;\n• the level of market acceptance and demand for our products and services from MNOs and their end-user customers;\n• the ability to introduce products and services that satisfy market demand;\n• the ability to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements in the countries in which we plan to operate;\n• the effectiveness of competitors in developing and offering similar services and products;\n• consumer acceptance of initial phases of the SpaceMobile Service which is not expected to provide continuous service;\n16\n• the ability to find third parties to successfully launch our satellites; and\n• the ability to maintain competitive prices for our products and services and to control our expenses.\nAlso, if the experience of the SpaceMobile Service’s end-users is not reasonably equivalent to the experience they have using a terrestrial network,\nwe may not achieve widespread consumer acceptance.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Abel Avellan, our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and if we are unable to retain Mr.\nAvellan, attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical and engineering personnel, our ability to compete could be\nharmed.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel. We are highly dependent on the services of Abel Avellan, our founder,\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Avellan is the source of many of the unique technology and development of our business. If Mr. Avellan\nwere to discontinue his employment with the Company due to death, disability or any other reason, we would be significantly disadvantaged. The\nunexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train and develop other highly qualified personnel, in particular\nengineers. Experienced and highly skilled employees are in high demand, competition for these employees can be intense and there may be concerns\nregarding new employees’ unauthorized disclosure of competitors’ trade secrets, and our ability to hire, attract and retain them depends on our\nability to provide competitive compensation. Because our satellites are based on a different technology platform than traditional LEO satellites,\nindividuals with sufficient training in our technology may not be available to hire, and as a result, we will need to expend significant time and\nexpense training the employees it does hire. We may not be able to attract, assimilate, develop or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our\nfailure to do so could adversely affect our business, including the execution of our business strategy. Any failure by our management team and our\nemployees to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nRapid and significant technological changes could render the SpaceMobile Service obsolete and impair our ability to compete.\nThe satellite communications industry is subject to rapid advances and innovations in technology. We may face competition in the future from\ncompanies using new technologies and new satellite systems, including competitors who may have more resources than we do. New technology\ncould render the planned SpaceMobile Service obsolete or less competitive by satisfying customer demand in more attractive ways or through the\nintroduction of incompatible standards. Particular technological developments that could adversely affect the business plan may include the\ndeployment by our competitors of new satellites with greater power, flexibility, efficiency or capabilities than ours, as well as continuing\nimprovements in terrestrial wireless technologies. For us to keep pace with technological changes and remain competitive, we may need to make\nsignificant capital expenditures, including capital to design and launch new products and services. Customer acceptance of the products and services\nthat we offer may be affected continually by technology-based differences in product and service offerings compared to those of competitors. New\ntechnologies may also be protected by patents or other intellectual property laws and therefore may not be available. Any failure to implement new\ntechnology within our SpaceMobile Service may compromise our ability to compete.\nIf we fail to manage our future growth effectively, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely\naffected.\nWe intend to expand our operations significantly as we develop the SpaceMobile Service and commence commercial operations. To properly\nmanage our growth, we will need to hire and retain additional personnel, and improve our business processes and controls. Our future expansion\nwill include:\n• hiring and training new personnel;\n• assembling, operating, and servicing the satellite network;\n• developing new technologies;\n• controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations; and\n• implementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes.\nFailure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the quality of the execution of our business plan, our ability to attract\nand retain professionals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n17\nAlso, as we introduce new services or enter into new markets, we may face new market, technological, operational, compliance and administrative\nrisks and challenges, including risks and challenges unfamiliar to us. We may not be able to mitigate these risks and challenges to achieve our\nanticipated growth or successfully execute large and complex projects, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe could fail to achieve revenue, or experience a decline in revenue, as a result of increasing competition from companies in the wireless\ncommunications industry, including wireless and other satellite operators, and from the extension of land-based communications services or\nnew technologies.\nWe may face increased competition from new competitors, new technologies or new equipment, including new LEO constellations and expansion of\nexisting geostationary satellite systems, new technology that could eliminate the need for a satellite system or redeployment of existing technologies\nto serve the direct to cellular handset market. Satellite service providers or others that rely on satellites for their business purposes and end markets,\nincluding us, face a currently challenging industry as evidenced by the past bankruptcies of OneWeb and Intelsat. The provision of satellite-based\nservices and products is subject to downward price pressure when capacity exceeds demand. In addition to satellite-based competitors, terrestrial\nvoice and data service providers, both wireline and wireless, could further expand into rural and remote areas and provide the same general types of\nservices and products that we intend to provide. Although satellite communications services and terrestrial communications services are not perfect\nsubstitutes, the two compete in some markets and for some services and this competition may increase if the SpaceMobile Service proves\nsuccessful. Consumers generally perceive terrestrial wireless voice communication products and services as less expensive and more convenient\nthan those that are satellite-based. As a result of competition, we may not be able to successfully launch our SpaceMobile Service or products, retain\nour customers and attract new customers.\nWe face competition from existing and potential competitors in the telecommunications industry, including terrestrial and satellite-based\nnetwork systems.\nThe mobile satellite services industry at-large is highly competitive, and we currently face substantial general competition from other service\nproviders that offer a range of mobile and fixed communications options. There are also a number of competitors working to develop innovative\nsolutions to compete in this industry. Also, while we view our services as largely complementary to terrestrial wireline and wireless communications\nnetworks through our MNO partnerships, we also compete with them indirectly.\nWe face competition from existing service providers such as Inmarsat, Globalstar, ORBCOMM, Thuraya Telecommunications Co. and Iridium\nCommunications that offer a range of mobile and fixed communications options. In the case of fixed broadband operators, a VSAT end-user\nterminal is used to provide service while with mobile satellite service providers a special purpose satellite phone is required. In addition, we face\ncompetition from companies developing new LEO networks such as SpaceX’s Starlink, OneWeb and Amazon’s Kuiper. In 2023, Apple introduced a\nnew service supported by Globalstar which provides SOS Emergency Service capabilities to its latest generation iPhones. In September 2022,\nSpaceX and T-Mobile US announced that they plan to offer a text based service from a constellation that will be built in the future.\nWe also will compete with regional mobile satellite communications services in several geographic markets. In these cases, the majority of our\ncompetitors’ customers require regional, not global, mobile voice and data services so competitors may present a viable alternative to the\nSpaceMobile Service. These regional competitors operate or plan to operate geostationary satellites. In some markets, we compete directly or\nindirectly with very small aperture terminal operators that offer communications services through private networks using very small aperture\nterminals or hybrid systems to target business users. We also compete indirectly with terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks and\nto the extent that terrestrial communications companies invest in underdeveloped areas, we may face increased competition in those areas.\nFurthermore, some foreign competitors may benefit from government subsidies, or other protective measures, afforded by their home countries.\nSome of these competitors, as well as other existing companies that may seek to enter the markets we serve, may be larger amounts of capital and\nother resources, have access to financing and capital resources on more advantageous terms, and may provide more efficient products or services\nthan we will be able to provide, any of which could reduce our market share and adversely affect our revenues and business.\n18\nWe will be dependent on third parties to market and sell our products and services.\nWe expect to rely on MNOs to market and sell our products and services to end users and to determine the prices end users pay. As a result of these\narrangements, we will be dependent on the performance of our commercial partners to generate most of our revenue. Such commercial partners will\noperate independently of us, which exposes us to significant risks. Commercial partners may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell\nour products and services and may also market and sell competitive products and services. Also, such commercial partners may not comply with the\nlaws and regulatory requirements in their local jurisdictions, which could limit their ability to market or sell our products and services.\nWe are currently party to a number of preliminary agreements and understandings with MNOs. However, before we can offer the service, we will\nneed to negotiate definitive commercial agreements with MNOs, which would supersede these preliminary agreements and understandings. There\ncan be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate such definitive commercial agreements on terms acceptable to us. Also, many of these\npreliminary agreements and understandings will need to be renewed as their terms will end before we launch the SpaceMobile Service. If current or\nfuture commercial partners do not perform adequately or agree to commercially reasonable terms acceptable to us, we may be unable to achieve our\ntargeted revenue in these markets or enter new markets, and we may not realize our expected growth, and our brand image and reputation could be\ndamaged.\nWe rely on third parties for the supply of equipment, satellite components and services.\nOur business depends in large part on our ability to execute our plans to assemble, integrate and test our satellites and components. We rely on\nmultiple suppliers to supply and produce certain highly-technical components. Any failure of these suppliers or others to perform could require us to\nseek alternative suppliers or to expand our production capabilities, which could incur additional costs and have a negative impact on our cost or\nsupply of components. Also, production or logistics in supply or production areas or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of\nreasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, transportation difficulties,\ncommercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues or international trade disputes. If\nany of our suppliers terminate their relationships with us, fail to provide equipment or services on a timely basis, or fail to meet performance\nexpectations, we may be unable to launch satellites in a timely manner or provide products or services to customers in a competitive manner, which\ncould in turn negatively affect our financial results and reputation.\nOur continued development of our SpaceMobile Service is and will be subject to risks, including with respect to:\n• securing necessary components on acceptable terms and in a timely manner;\n• delays in delivery of final component designs to our suppliers;\n• our ability to attract, recruit, hire and train skilled employees;\n• quality controls;\n• legal or regulatory limitations placed on our launch providers as a result of geopolitical actions or otherwise;\n• satellite launch or deployment failures;\n• negotiation of agreements with launch providers;\n• delays or disruptions in supply chain; and\n• other delays and cost overruns.\nWe do not know whether we will be able to develop efficient, automated, low-cost production capabilities and processes and reliable sources of\ncomponent supply that will enable us to successfully operate our SpaceMobile Service. Any failure to develop such production processes and\ncapabilities within our projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe and our suppliers rely on complex systems and components, which involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms of\noperational performance and costs.\nWe and our suppliers rely on complex systems and components for the operation and assembly of our satellites, which involves a significant degree\nof uncertainty and risk in terms of operational performance and costs. These components may suffer unexpected malfunctions from time to time and\nmay require repairs and spare parts to resume operations, which may not be readily available when needed. Unexpected malfunctions of these\ncomponents may significantly affect the intended operational efficiency.\n19\nOperational performance and costs can be difficult to predict and are often influenced by factors outside of our control, such as, but not limited to,\nscarcity of natural resources, environmental hazards and remediation, difficulty or delays in obtaining governmental permit, damages or defects in\nvarious components, industrial accidents, fire, seismic activity and natural disasters. Should operational risks materialize, it may result in the\nmonetary losses, delays, unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs and\npotential legal liabilities, all which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results.\nWe face substantial risks associated with our international operations.\nWe plan to offer our SpaceMobile Service in international markets and intend to collaborate with a number of foreign MNOs. Also, we have\ndevelopment offices or teams in India, Scotland, Spain and Israel. We also source supplies from international suppliers. Operating in foreign\ncountries poses substantial risks, including:\n• difficulties in developing products and services that are tailored to the needs of local customers;\n• unavailability of, or difficulties in establishing, relationships with local MNOs;\n• instability of international economies and governments, including geopolitical conflicts, acts of hostility or war;\n• changes in laws and policies affecting trade and investment in other jurisdictions,\n• exposure to varying legal standards, including data privacy, security and intellectual property protection in other jurisdictions;\n• difficulties in obtaining required regulatory authorizations;\n• difficulties in enforcing legal rights in other jurisdictions;\n• local domestic ownership requirements;\n• requirements that certain operational activities be performed in-country;\n• changing and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements;\n• foreign currency exchange rates and exchange controls; and\n• ongoing compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. export controls, anti-money laundering and trade sanction laws, and\nsimilar anti-corruption and international trade laws in other countries.\nMNOs will expose us to currency exchange risk, and we cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and\noperating results.\nFollowing the launch of the SpaceMobile Service in international markets, our international operations will be sensitive to currency exchange risks.\nWe anticipate having currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as well as intercompany\ntransactions. Significant changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies in which we anticipate transacting business and the U.S. dollar may\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be negatively affected by global economic conditions.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk\nas individual consumers, businesses and governments may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, declines in\nincome or asset values, or budgetary constraints. Reduced demand could cause a significant delay in the launch of our satellites or the development\nof the SpaceMobile Service which in turn could cause a decline in our anticipated future revenue and make it more difficult to operate profitably in\nthe future, potentially compromising our ability to pursue our business plan. We expect our future growth rate will be affected by the condition of\nthe global economy, increased competition, maturation of the satellite communications industry, and the difficulty in sustaining high growth rates as\nwe increase in size.\n20\nPursuing strategic transactions may cause us to incur additional risks.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic transactions from time to time. We may face costs and risks arising from any such\ntransactions, including integrating a new business into our business or managing a joint venture. These risks may include adverse legal,\norganizational and financial consequences, loss of key customers and distributors, and diversion of management’s time.\nAlso, any major business combination or similar strategic transaction may require significant additional financing. Further, depending on market\nconditions, investor perceptions of us and other factors, we might not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, in acceptable amounts, or at\nappropriate times to implement any such transaction.\nCovenants and events of default in our debt instruments could limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely affect\nour liquidity. Additionally, our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our financial\ncondition and liquidity. Further, we have pledged substantially all our assets under these instruments.\nOur Atlas Credit Agreement, Term Loan Credit Agreement, and Lone Star Loan Agreement contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would\nlikely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage\nin acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n• incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n• pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n• prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n• issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n• make loans and investments;\n• sell assets;\n• incur liens;\n• enter into transactions with affiliates;\n• materially alter the businesses we conduct;\n• enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and\n• consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAdditionally, certain of these agreements require us, among other things, to maintain certain levels of liquidity, retain Abel Avellan as our chairman\nand Chief Executive Officer, maintain insurance policies on collateralized assets and collateralize all new intellectual property owned or acquired.\nOur ability to meet these conditions can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Atlas Credit Agreement, Term Loan Credit Agreement, Lone Star Loan Agreement, and Notes\n(as defined in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview”) could result in an event of\ndefault under the applicable agreement. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of\nany other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and\npayable, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which constitutes substantially all our assets. In\nthe event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that\nindebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n• limited in how we conduct our business;\n• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n• unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\n21\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and\nour credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially\nadversely affected.\nServicing our debt requires cash that would otherwise be used to fund our business plan, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our\nbusiness to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of interest on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating\nperformance.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could\nbe forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital\nor restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable\nterms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our debt\ninstruments restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or\nequity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain\nproceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be\ndue and payable and could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nRisks Related to Our Satellites and Planned SpaceMobile Service\nWe may not be able to launch our satellites successfully. Loss of a satellite during launch could delay or impair our ability to offer our services\nor reduce our expected potential revenues, and launch insurance, even if it is available, will not fully cover this risk.\nWe rely on third parties to launch our satellites. If we fail to find third parties to launch our satellites or if the third parties fail to perform or delay\ntheir performance, the SpaceMobile Service may not be made operational in the anticipated timeframe or at all. There are a limited number of third\nparties with the capabilities to launch our satellites, some of which are exploring services that could compete with the SpaceMobile Service.\nAlso, we may not be able to operate our satellites successfully due to mechanical deployment failures after launch or problems occurring during the\ndeployment once in space. In addition, we may not achieve the desired altitudes to operate our satellites which could result in a failure of our\nsatellites to operate as planned.\nWe expect to insure the launch, over time, of all or a portion of our satellites to operate the SpaceMobile Service as intended, but do not intend to\ninsure our satellites once they are launched for their remaining in-orbit operational lives. Launch insurance currently costs approximately 3.0% to\n15.0% of the insured value of the satellite (including launch costs) but will vary depending on market conditions and the safety record of the launch\nvehicle. We may choose not to insure every launch or to only partially insure some or all launches. Even if a lost satellite is fully insured, acquiring a\nreplacement satellite may be difficult and time consuming. Furthermore, the insurance does not cover lost revenue.\nWe expect any launch failure insurance policies that we obtain to include specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations.\nTypically, these insurance policies exclude coverage for damage arising from acts of war, lasers, and other similar potential risks for which\nexclusions are customary in the industry at the time the policy is written.\nIf launch insurance rates were to rise substantially, all of the launch costs would increase. Also, in light of increasing costs, the scope of insurance\nexclusions and limitations on the nature of the losses for which we can obtain insurance, or other business reasons, we may conclude that it does not\nmake business sense to obtain third-party insurance and may decide to pursue other strategies for mitigating the risk of a satellite launch failure,\nsuch as obtaining relaunch guaranties from the launch provider. It is also possible that insurance could become unavailable, either generally or for a\nspecific launch vehicle, or that new insurance could be subject to broader exclusions on coverage, in which event we would bear the risk of launch\nfailures.\n22\nOur satellites may experience operational problems, which could affect our ability to provide an acceptable level of service to the end-user\ncustomers.\nOnce the SpaceMobile Service is developed and operational, we may experience intermittent signal disruptions, dropped connections, call initiation\nfailures or data transmission disruptions. If the magnitude or frequency of such problems occur repeatedly, we may no longer able to provide a\ncommercially acceptable level of service, our business and financial results and reputation would be harmed and our ability to pursue our business\nplan would be compromised. Also, failure to provide an acceptable level of service could cause MNOs to seek other solutions for their customers.\nFrom time to time, we may reposition our satellites within the constellation to optimize service, which could result in degraded service during the\nrepositioning period. Although we will have some ability to remedy some types of problems affecting the performance of satellites remotely from\nthe ground, the physical repair of our satellites in space is not feasible.\nOur products could fail to perform or could perform at reduced levels of service because of technological malfunctions or deficiencies,\nregulatory compliance issues, or events outside of our control, which would harm our business and reputation.\nOur products and services are subject to the risks inherent in a global, complex telecommunications system employing advanced technology and\nheavily regulated by, among others, the FCC and similar authorities internationally. Any disruption to our satellites, services, information systems or\ntelecommunications infrastructure, or regulatory compliance issues, could result in the inability or reduced ability of end-user customers to receive\nservices for an indeterminate period of time. These customers may include government agencies conducting mission-critical work throughout the\nworld, as well as consumers and businesses located in remote areas of the world and operating under harsh environmental conditions where\ntraditional telecommunications services may not be readily available. Any disruption to the SpaceMobile Service or extended periods of reduced\nlevels of service could cause us to lose customers or revenue, result in delays or cancellations of future implementations of our products and\nservices, result in failure to attract customers, or result in litigation, customer service or repair work that would involve substantial costs and distract\nmanagement from operating our business. The failure of any of the diverse elements of the planned SpaceMobile Service, including our satellites, to\nfunction as required could render the SpaceMobile Service unable to perform at the quality and capacity levels required for success. Any system\nfailures, repeated product failures or shortened product life, or extended reduced levels of service could reduce our expected sales, increase costs, or\nresult in warranty or liability claims or litigation, and harm our business.\nOur satellites have a limited life and may fail prematurely, which would cause our network to be compromised and materially and adversely\naffect our business, prospects and potential profitability.\nWe may experience in-orbit malfunctions of our satellites once launched, which could adversely affect the reliability of their service or result in total\nfailure of the satellite. In-orbit failure of a satellite may result from various causes, including component failure, loss of power or fuel, inability to\ncontrol positioning of the satellite, solar or other astronomical events, including solar radiation, wind and flares, and space debris. Other factors that\ncould affect the useful lives of our satellites include the quality of construction, gradual degradation of solar panels and the durability of\ncomponents. Radiation-induced failure of satellite components may result in damage to, or loss of, a satellite before the end of its expected life.\nAlthough we would not incur any direct cash costs related to the failure of a satellite, if a satellite fails, we would expect to record an impairment\ncharge in our statement of operations to reduce the remaining net book value of that satellite to zero, and any such impairment charges could depress\nour net income for the period in which the failure occurs.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar services and products, potentially\nresulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property\nand to keep our use of exclusive licenses. To accomplish this, we will rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets (including know-how),\nemployee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish\nand protect our rights in our technology.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights will be important to our future business opportunities. However, the measures we take to protect\nour intellectual property from unauthorized use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:\n• any patent applications we submit may not result in the issuance of patents;\n23\n• the scope of our issued patents, including our patent claims, may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights;\n• our issued patents may be challenged or invalidated by our competitors;\n• our employees or business partners may breach their confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-use obligations to us;\n• third parties may independently develop technologies that are the same or similar to ours;\n• the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make\nenforcement impracticable; and\n• current and future competitors may circumvent our intellectual property.\nPatent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws vary throughout the world. Some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to\nthe same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Further, policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions may be difficult.\nTherefore, our intellectual property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the U.S. Also, we may have difficulty enforcing our\nrights against a competitor where an infringement occurs in outer space.\nOur intellectual property applications for registration may not issue or be registered, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to\nprevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.\nWe cannot be certain that we are the first inventor of the subject matter to which we have filed a particular patent application, or if we are the first\nparty to file such a patent application. If another party has filed a patent application to the same subject matter as we have, we may not be entitled to\nthe protection sought by the patent application. We also cannot be certain whether the claims included in a patent application will ultimately be\nallowed in the applicable issued patent. Further, the scope of protection of issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot\nbe certain that the patent applications that we file will issue, or that our issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar\ntechnology. Also, our competitors may design around our issued patents, which may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe may in the future become subject to claims that our satellites or services violate the patent or intellectual property rights of others, which\ncould be costly and disruptive to us.\nWe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation. Although we maintain intellectual property litigation\ninsurance (currently $7.0 million for defending infringement claims and $10.0 million to bring offensive infringement claims), the defense of\nintellectual property suit is both costly and time-consuming, even if ultimately successful, and may divert management’s attention from other\nbusiness concerns. An adverse determination in litigation to which we may become a party could, among other things:\n• subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, including lost profit and treble damages that are not covered by insurance;\n• require disputed rights to be licensed from a third party for royalties that may be substantial;\n• require us to cease using technology that is important to our business; or\n• prohibit us from using some or all of our devices or offering some or all of our services.\nOur customized hardware and software may be difficult and expensive to service, upgrade or replace.\nSome of the hardware and software we use in operating our SpaceMobile Service is significantly customized and tailored to meet our requirements\nand specifications and could be difficult and expensive to service, upgrade or replace. Although we expect to maintain inventories of some spare\nparts, it nonetheless may be difficult, expensive or impossible to obtain replacement parts for the hardware due to a limited number of those parts\nbeing manufactured to our requirements and specifications. Also, our business plan contemplates updating or replacing some of the hardware and\nsoftware in our network as technology advances, but the complexity of our requirements and specifications may present us with technical and\noperational challenges that complicate or otherwise make it expensive or infeasible to carry out such upgrades and replacements. If we are not able\nto suitably service, upgrade or replace our equipment, our ability to provide our services and therefore to generate revenue could be harmed.\n24\nOur networks and those of our third-party service providers and MNOs may be vulnerable to security risks.\nWe expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our ability to compete for\nbusiness, manage our risks, and protect our customers and our reputation. Our network and those of our third-party service providers and our\ncustomers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer attacks, viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security\nmeasures could wrongfully access and obtain or use information on our network or cause service interruptions, delays or malfunctions in our\ndevices, services or operations, any of which could harm our reputation, cause demand for our products and services to fall, and compromise our\nability to pursue our business plan. Recently, there have been reported a number of significant, widespread security attacks and breaches that have\ncompromised network integrity for many companies and governmental agencies, in some cases reportedly originating from outside the United\nStates. Also, there are reportedly private products available in the market today which may attempt to unlawfully intercept communications made\nusing our network. We may be required to expend significant resources to respond to, contain, remediate, and protect against these attacks and\nthreats, including compliance with applicable data breach and security laws and regulations, and to alleviate problems, including reputational harm\nand litigation, caused by these security incidents. In the event of such a security incident, our customer contracts may not adequately protect us\nagainst liability to third parties with whom our customers conduct business. Although we have implemented and intend to continue to implement\nsecurity measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate. These security incidents could have a significant effect on our systems, devices and\nservices, including system failures and delays that could limit network availability, which could harm our business and our reputation and result in\nsubstantial liability.\nCyberattacks impacting our networks or systems may have a material effect on our operations.\nCyberattacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, distributed denial of services attacks, ransomware attacks, credential\nharvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems could\nhave a material adverse effect on our operations. Cyberattacks can cause equipment or network failures, loss of information, including sensitive\npersonal information of employees or proprietary information, as well as disruption to our operations, which could result in significant expenses,\npotential investigations and legal liability, and reputational damage. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly\nand requires ongoing monitoring and updating. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyberattacks that, individually or in aggregate, have been\nmaterial to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyberattacks may be insufficient\nto repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyberattack in the future.\nOur satellites may collide with space debris or another spacecraft, which could adversely affect the performance of our SpaceMobile Service.\nAlthough we expect to comply with best practices and international orbital debris mitigation requirements to actively maneuver our satellites to\navoid potential collisions with space debris or other spacecraft, including an onboard propulsion system and altitude and orbit control system, these\nabilities are limited by, among other factors, uncertainties and inaccuracies in the projected orbit location of, and predicted collisions with, debris\nobjects tracked and cataloged by governments or other entities. Additionally, some space debris is too small to be tracked and therefore its orbital\nlocation is unknown; nevertheless, this debris is still large enough to potentially cause severe damage or a failure of our satellites should a collision\noccur. If our satellites collide with space debris or other spacecraft, our SpaceMobile Service could be impaired. Also, a failure of one or more of\nour satellites or the occurrence of equipment failures, collision damage, or other related problems that may result during the de-orbiting process\ncould constitute an uninsured loss and could materially harm our financial condition.\n25\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Matters\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation worldwide, which mandates how we may operate our business and may increase the\ncost of providing services and expansion into new markets.\nOur ownership and operation of a satellite communications system and the sale of services from such system are subject to significant regulation in\nthe United States, including by the FCC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and others, and in foreign jurisdictions by similar local authorities. The\nrules and regulations of these U.S. and foreign authorities may change, and such authorities may adopt regulations that limit or restrict our\noperations as presently conducted or currently contemplated. Such authorities may also make changes to the licenses of our partners or competitors\nthat affect their spectrum, and may, in turn, significantly affect our business. Further, because regulations in each country are different, we may not\nbe aware if some of our partners or persons with whom we do business do not hold the requisite licenses and approvals. Our failure to provide\nservices in accordance with the terms of our licenses or our failure to operate our satellites or ground stations as required by our licenses and\napplicable laws and government regulations could result in the imposition of government sanctions and/or monetary fines, including the suspension\nor cancellation of our licenses.\nOur ability to provide service to our customers and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse governmental regulatory actions.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation. Our ability to secure all requisite governmental approvals is not assured, and the process\nof obtaining governmental authorizations and permits can be very time-consuming and time-sensitive, and require compliance with a wide array of\nadministrative and procedural rules. Our pending application seeking FCC approval to operate feeder links at fixed locations on V-band frequencies\nin the U.S. has been opposed by multiple competitors in the satellite mobile and terrestrial wireless businesses and we have no assurance if, and\nwhen, the requested authority will be forthcoming or what terms and conditions the FCC might impose on a grant. Multiple parties also have\nobjected to both the process by which we propose to request authority to use spectrum generally allocated for terrestrial broadband mobile services\nand to the substance of that forthcoming request. We have no assurance regarding the outcome of these objections. Also, we have not yet obtained\npermission from the FCC to operate service links directly to end user handsets and other devices. A failure by us to obtain required approvals could\ncompromise our ability to generate revenue or conduct our business in one or more countries. Our requests for regulatory approvals may be subject\nto challenges by adverse parties and these challenges may delay or prevent favorable action. Furthermore, regulatory approvals can be issued subject\nto conditions that have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan.\nThe government approvals required for us to operate the SpaceMobile Service need to be periodically renewed and renewal is not guaranteed. The\napprovals also are subject to revocation, and we may be subject to fines, forfeitures, penalties or other sanctions if any issuing authority were to find\nthat we are not in compliance with the applicable rules, regulations or policies. The regulatory obligations we must meet are complex, vary greatly\nfrom country to country, and are subject to interpretation. We cannot give any assurance that the governments will agree with or accept our\ncompliance efforts.\nThe regulations we and our competitors must adhere to are subject to change by the issuing governmental authorities and there is no guarantee that\nchanges will not be made that are adverse to our business. Regulatory changes, such as those resulting from judicial decisions or the adoption of\ntreaties, legislation or regulations in countries where we operate or intend to operate may also significantly affect our business.\nOur ability to offer one or more services in important countries or regions of the world may be limited due to regulatory requirements or\ngeopolitical events.\nOur ability to provide SpaceMobile Service may be limited in some jurisdictions by local regulations. For example, some countries have local\ndomestic ownership requirements, or requirements for physical facilities or gateways within their jurisdictions, that may be difficult for us to satisfy.\nIn some countries, we may not be able to reach a commercially viable agreement with an MNO that will enable us to access the spectrum needed to\ndeliver the SpaceMobile Service. Also, geopolitical events, such as the outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as related sanctions and other trade\nrestrictions, could impair our ability to provide services in important areas. The inability to offer or provide the SpaceMobile Service in certain\nmarkets could impair us from achieving our revenue and growth plans.\n26\nWe expect to provide our SpaceMobile Service in the U.S. and elsewhere on frequencies not regularly allocated for mobile-satellite service,\nwhich requires regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will receive or be able to maintain such approval.\nThe SpaceMobile Service will utilize end-user frequencies that are not allocated to satellite services. Instead, the SpaceMobile Service will be\ndelivered to end-user customers over frequencies generally allocated for terrestrial broadband mobile services. The SpaceMobile Service’s use of\nspectrum generally allocated for terrestrial broadband mobile services, and our ability to access the U.S. market, will need approval by the FCC. If\nthe FCC does not provide approval, our business will be significantly, adversely affected, and the provision of the SpaceMobile Service could be\ndelayed or diminished, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because terrestrial\nmobile frequencies are licensed to carriers throughout the U.S., our use of such spectrum will be pursuant to a cooperative arrangement with one or\nmore MNOs, such as spectrum leasing agreements. Our access to this spectrum will be subject to approval or notification by the regulatory licensing\nauthority, and any such approval or notification may be delayed or rejected, which may substantially affect our business. Under such arrangements,\nwe will not be the license holder for the spectrum, and our continued access to and use of the frequencies will be subject to the ongoing consent of\nthe MNO, and to the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement with such MNO. There can be no assurance that we can reach suitable\ncooperative agreements with MNOs or that such agreements will continue for the life of the SpaceMobile Service.\nThe shared use of the terrestrial broadband spectrum by us and the MNO will require the implementation of procedures and safeguards to avoid\ninterference to other users. While we believe our SpaceMobile Service will be able to avoid such interference through our patented technology,\nbecause the SpaceMobile Service is a new and innovative service that has not yet been implemented, the nature, extent and effectiveness of these\ninterference avoidance techniques, and their effect on the service we will deliver, remains to be practically proven. If the SpaceMobile Service\ncauses or receives harmful interference, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe SpaceMobile Service may qualify as a commercial mobile radio service which will subject us to a variety of ongoing regulatory\nrequirements.\nGovernment regulators have adopted a broad array of regulations governing the terms and conditions of wireless service designed to protect\nconsumers and the public interest. While our arrangements with the MNOs will address some of these requirements, these regulatory obligations\nmay prove burdensome and could have an adverse effect on our business. If we fail to comply in any material respect with any of these regulatory\nrequirements, we could be subject to financial penalties or enforcement action, including the loss of authority to provide service.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from\ncertain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to\nsuch requirements.\nAs of March 28, 2024, Mr. Avellan and his permitted transferees hold all of the Class C Common Stock, which prior to the Sunset Date will entitle\nsuch holders to cast the lesser of 10 votes per share and the Class C Share Voting Amount, the latter of which is a number of votes per share equal to\n(1) (x) an amount of votes equal to 88.3% of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock, minus (y) the total voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock (other than Class C Common Stock) owned or controlled by Mr. Avellan and his permitted transferees, divided by (2) the\nnumber of shares of our Class C Common Stock then outstanding. As a result, as of March 28, 2024, Mr. Avellan and his permitted transferees\nholdings, control approximately 81.5% of the combined voting power of our Common Stock, and may control a majority of our voting power so\nlong as the Class C Common Stock represents at least 9.1% of our total Common Stock. As a result of Mr. Avellan and his permitted transferees\nholdings, we qualify as a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under these rules, a listed\ncompany of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect\nnot to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that (i) a majority of our Board of Directors consist of\nindependent directors, (ii) we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (iii) director nominees be\nselected or recommended to the board by independent directors.\n27\nWe rely on certain of these exemptions. As a result, we do not have a nominating and corporate governance committee consisting entirely of\nindependent directors and our directors were not nominated or selected solely by independent directors. We may also rely on the other exemptions\nso long as we qualify as a controlled company. To the extent we rely on any of these exemptions, holders of our Class A Common Stock will not\nhave the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nThe multi-class structure of our Common Stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Chief Executive Officer, which will limit\nan investor’s ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change of control.\nHolders of shares of our Class A Common Stock are entitled to cast one vote per share of Class A Common Stock, while holders of shares of our\nClass C Common Stock are (1) prior to the Sunset Date, entitled to cast the lesser of (x) 10 votes per share and (y) the Class C Share Voting Amount\nand (2) from and after the Sunset Date, entitled to cast one vote per share. As of March 28, 2024, Mr. Avellan and his permitted transferees\ncontrolled approximately 81.5% of the combined voting power of our Common Stock as a result of their ownership of all of our Class C Common\nStock. Accordingly, while we do not intend to issue additional Class C Common Stock in the future, Mr. Avellan will be able to exercise control\nover all matters requiring our stockholders’ approval, including the election of our directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any\nmerger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Mr. Avellan may have interests that differ\nfrom yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the\neffect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a\npremium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market price of shares of our Class A Common\nStock.\nWe cannot predict the impact our multi-class structure may have on the stock price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of Class A Common Stock or in adverse\npublicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-\nclass share structures in certain of their indices. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most\nnewly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the S&P 500, S&P\nMidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider,\nopened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of\nits indices; however, in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in its indices and to\nlaunch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our multi-class capital structure\nwould make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that\nattempt to passively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are still fairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if\nany, they will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these\nvaluations compared to those of other similar companies that are included. Because of our multi-class structure, we will likely be excluded from\ncertain of these indices and we cannot assure you that other stock indices will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds\ninto passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and\ncould make shares of our Class A Common Stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of shares of our Class A Common\nStock could be adversely affected.\nWe are a holding company and rely primarily on distributions from AST LLC to fund our operations.\nWe are a holding company and our principal asset is our interest in AST LLC, and, accordingly all of our operations and activities relate to the\noperations and activities of AST LLC. We do not have independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes,\noperating expenses, and pay any dividends in the future is dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of AST LLC. There can be no\nassurance that AST LLC will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including\nnegative covenants under debt instruments, will permit such distributions. If AST LLC does not distribute sufficient funds to us to pay our taxes or\nother liabilities, we may default on contractual obligations or need to borrow additional funds, which may not be available. In the event that we are\nrequired to, and able to, borrow additional funds it could adversely affect our liquidity and subject us to additional restrictions imposed by lenders.\n28\nIf we were deemed an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”),\napplicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nAn issuer will generally be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the Investment Company Act if:\n• it is an “orthodox” investment company because it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the\nbusiness of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or\n• it is an inadvertent investment company because, absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having\na value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nWe believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of developing and providing access to a space-based cellular broadband network to be\naccessible by standard smartphones and not primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We hold ourselves out as\ncommunications company and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Accordingly, we\ndo not believe that we are an “orthodox” investment company as described in the first bullet point above. Furthermore, we treat AST as a majority-\nowned subsidiary for purposes of the Investment Company Act. Therefore, we believe that less than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S.\ngovernment securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis comprise assets that could be considered investment securities. Accordingly, we\ndo not believe that we or AST will be an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40% inadvertent investment company test as described in\nthe second bullet point above. Also, we believe we will not be an investment company under section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act\nbecause we will be primarily engaged in a non-investment company business.\nThe Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operations of investment companies.\nAmong other things, the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the\nissuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the issuance of stock options, and impose certain governance requirements. We intend to continue to\nconduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if anything were\nto happen that would cause us to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, requirements imposed by the\nInvestment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates (including AST) and ability to\ncompensate key employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and\narrangements between and among AST, us or our senior management team, or any combination thereof and materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Tax\nOur principal asset is our interest in AST LLC, and accordingly we depend on distributions from AST LLC to make any payments required to be\nmade by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAST LLC is treated as partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income\ntax. Instead, taxable income is allocated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the holders AST Common Units and Incentive Equity Units.\nUnder the terms of the A&R Operating Agreement, AST LLC is obligated to make pro rata tax distributions to holders of AST Common Units and\nIncentive Equity Units calculated at certain assumed rates. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations,\nincluding payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be significant and some of which will be reimbursed by AST LLC\n(excluding payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement). For so long as we are Managing Member (as defined in the A&R Operating\nAgreement) of AST LLC, we intend to cause AST LLC to make ordinary distributions and tax distributions to the holders of AST Common Units\nand Incentive Equity Units on a pro rata basis in amounts sufficient to enable us to cover all applicable taxes, relevant operating expenses, payments\nunder the Tax Receivable Agreement and dividends, if any, declared by us. However, AST LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject\nto various limitations and restrictions, including, but not limited to, retention of amounts necessary to satisfy the obligations of AST LLC and its\nsubsidiaries and restrictions on distributions that would violate any applicable restrictions contained in AST LLC’s debt agreements, or any\napplicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering AST LLC insolvent. To the extent we are unable to make payments under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Additionally, nonpayment for a specified\nperiod and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and\ntherefore accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be material.\n29\nIf the distributions received from AST LLC exceed our actual tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement,\nour Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, will make any determination from time to time with respect to the use of any such excess cash so\naccumulated, which may include, among other uses, to pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock. We will have no obligation to distribute such\ncash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to our stockholders.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement requires us to make cash payments to the TRA Holders in respect of certain tax benefits and such payments may\nbe substantial. In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may (i) exceed any actual tax benefits the Tax Group realizes or\n(ii) be accelerated.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are\ngenerally required to pay the TRA Holders (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) 85% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal,\nstate, local, and foreign taxes that are based on, or measured with respect to, net income or profits, and any interest related thereto that we and any\napplicable consolidated, unitary, or combined Subsidiaries (the “Tax Group”) realize, or are deemed to realize, as a result of certain “Tax\nAttributes”, which include:\n• existing tax basis in certain assets of AST LLC and certain of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including assets that will eventually be\nsubject to depreciation or amortization, once placed in service, attributable to AST Common Units acquired by us from a TRA Holder\n(including AST Common Units held by a Blocker Corporation (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) acquired by us in a\nReorganization Transaction (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement)), each as determined at the time of the relevant acquisition;\n• tax basis adjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of AST Common Units (including any such adjustments resulting from certain\npayments made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement) acquired by us from a TRA Holder pursuant to the terms of the A&R Operating\nAgreement;\n• tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement; and\n• certain tax attributes of Blocker Corporations holding AST Common Units that are acquired directly or indirectly by us pursuant to a\nReorganization Transaction.\nPayments under the TRA generally will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine (with the amount of subject payments determined\nin consultation with an advisory firm and subject to the TRA Holder Representative’s review and consent), and the IRS or another taxing authority\nmay challenge all or any part of a position taken with respect to Tax Attributes or the utilization thereof, as well as other tax positions that we take,\nand a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event that any Tax Attributes initially claimed or utilized by the Tax Group are disallowed, the TRA\nHolders will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made pursuant to the Tax Receivable\nAgreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, any excess payments made to such TRA\nHolders will be applied against and reduce any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by us to the applicable TRA Holders under the\nTax Receivable Agreement, after the determination of such excess. However, a challenge to any Tax Attributes initially claimed or utilized by the\nTax Group may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, even if challenged earlier, such excess cash payment\nmay be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable\nAgreement. As a result, there might not be future cash payments against which such excess can be applied and we could be required to make\npayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of the Tax Group’s actual savings in respect of the Tax Attributes.\nMoreover, the TRA provides that, in the event (such events collectively, “Early Termination Events”) that (i) we exercise our early termination\nrights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) certain changes of control of the Company or AST occur (as described in the A&R Operating\nAgreement), (iii) we, in certain circumstances, fail to make a payment required to be made pursuant to the TRA by its final payment date, which\nnon-payment continues for 60 days following such final payment date or (iv) we materially breach (or are deemed to materially breach) any of our\nmaterial obligations under the TRA other than as described in the foregoing clause (iii) and, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), unless certain\nliquidity related or restrictive covenant related exceptions apply, our obligations under the TRA will accelerate (if the TRA Holder Representative so\nelects in the case of clauses (ii)-(iv)) and, we will be required to make a lump-sum cash payment to all the TRA Holders equal to the present value\nof all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the TRA, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain\nassumptions, including those relating to there being sufficient future taxable income of the Tax Group to fully utilize the Tax Attributes over certain\nspecified time periods and that all AST Common Units (including AST Common Units held by Blocker Corporations) that had not yet been\nexchanged for Class A Common Stock or cash are deemed exchanged for cash. The lump-sum payment could be material and could materially\nexceed any actual tax benefits that the Tax Group realizes subsequent to such payment.\n30\nPayments under the TRA will be our obligations and not obligations of AST LLC. Any actual increase in our allocable share of AST and its relevant\nsubsidiaries’ tax basis in relevant assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, will vary depending upon a number of\nfactors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of the Class A Common Stock at the time of an exchange of AST Common Units by a\nTRA Holder pursuant to the terms of the A&R Operating Agreement and the amount and timing of the recognition of the Tax Group’s income for\napplicable tax purposes. While many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that we will be required to make under the TRA are\noutside of our control, we expect that the aggregate payments we will be required to make under the TRA could be substantial and could have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition, which may be material.\nAny payments made by us under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To\nthe extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest\nuntil paid. Additionally, nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material\nobligation under the TRA and therefore accelerate payments due under the TRA. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the\nTRA could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the Tax Attributes\nthat may be deemed realized under the TRA. Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can\nadversely affect our, AST’s or its subsidiaries’ business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof in the United States or\nother jurisdictions.\nWe could also be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof in the United States or\nother jurisdictions and changes in tax law, including increases in applicable tax rates and limitations on deductions and credits, could reduce our\nafter-tax income and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur effective tax rate and tax liability are based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. These laws, regulations and\ntreaties are complex and often open to interpretation. In the future, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of laws, regulations and\ntreaties, resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate. Changes to tax laws\nmay also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nRisks Related to Owning our Class A Common Stock\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are required to comply with the SEC’s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to\ncertify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls\nover financial reporting. Additionally, once we no longer qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” we will be required to have our independent\nregistered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. An adverse report\nmay be issued in the event our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented,\ndesigned or operating.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a\ndeficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention\nby those charged with governance. When evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may\nnot be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404.\nWe are an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced\nreporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies could make our Class A\nCommon Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of\nexemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies,” including:\n• not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section\n404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n31\n• reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n• exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute payments not\npreviously approved.\nOur status as an emerging growth company will end as soon as any of the following takes place:\n• the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue;\n• the date we qualify as a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700.0 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates;\n• the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or\n• December 31, 2024, the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of NPA’s initial public offering.\nFurther, the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until\nprivate companies (that is, those that have not had a registration statement under the Securities Act declared effective or do not have a class of\nsecurities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides\nthat a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth\ncompanies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when\na standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt\nthe new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements\nwith another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor a company that has opted out of using the extended transition\nperiod, difficult because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe are also a smaller reporting company, as defined in the Exchange Act. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may\nstill qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to continue taking advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure\nrequirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our periodic reports and proxy\nstatements.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive if we choose to rely on any of the exemptions afforded to emerging growth\ncompanies or smaller reporting companies. If some investors find our securities stock less attractive because we rely on any of these exemptions,\nthere may be a less active trading market for our securities and the market price of those securities may be more volatile.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock (or shares of our Class A Common Stock that may be issued\nin the future pursuant to the exchange or redemption of AST Common Units) are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the\nmarket in the near future. This could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing\nwell.\nSubject to certain exceptions, pursuant to certain Stockholders’ Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2021, by and among the Company and the\nStockholder Parties (“Stockholders’ Agreement”) the Stockholders’ Agreement, the Sponsor and the AST Equityholders (together, the “Stockholder\nParties”) are contractually restricted from transferring any SpaceMobile common stock held by such party (other than approximately 2,500,000\nshares of Class A Common Stock purchased by certain Existing Equityholders in the Private Investment in Public Equity Investment (“PIPE\nInvestment”)) for a period of one year following the Closing of our initial business combination, or April 6, 2022 (the “Lock-Up Period”).\nFollowing the expiration of the Lock-up Period, no Stockholder Party will be restricted from selling shares of our Class A Common Stock held by\nthem or that may be received by them in exchange for AST Common Units or warrants, as the case may be, other than by applicable securities laws.\nAs such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the\nperception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Class A Common\nStock. As of March 28, 2024, the Stockholder Parties collectively owned approximately 53.7% of our outstanding common stock, representing\napproximately 87.6% of the voting power of our common stock, and the AST Equityholders, in turn, owned approximately 52.5% of the AST\nCommon Units. As restrictions on resale end, the sale or possibility of sale of these shares of Class A Common could have the effect of increasing\nthe volatility in the market price of our Class A Common Stock, or decreasing the market price itself.\n32\nWe require substantial amounts of capital, and we expect such requirements will increase in the future. As a result, our stockholders may\nexperience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings and such dilution may be substantial.\nIn order to execute our business plans, we will need a substantial amount of capital in the near term and in the future to further our business plan and\ndevelop the SpaceMobile Service, including expenses to:\n• design, develop, assemble, integrate, test and launch our Block 2 BB satellites;\n• design and develop the components of the SpaceMobile Service;\n• purchase direct materials and components;\n• expand our AIT facilities and production capabilities; and\n• support satellite and network operations.\nWe expect to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity related or debt securities, secured loan facilities, or through obtaining\ncredit from government or financial institutions or commercial partners, although our ability, if any, to access the capital markets during this period\nof volatility may require us to modify our current expectations. We are in discussions with various financing sources to enhance liquidity. We may in\nthe future offer additional shares of our Class A Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Class A Common Stock\nat a price per share that may be less than the price per share paid by any investors in previous offerings, and investors purchasing shares or other\nsecurities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. Given the substantial capital needs of our business and business plans,\nany such dilution may be substantial.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in the future, it may result in our independent auditors or management expressing substantial doubt\nabout our ability to continue as a going concern in future financial statements.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds when needed or on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional\nfunds when needed, our independent auditors or management may express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in\nfuture financial statements.\nBecause we will incur much of the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any revenues with respect thereto, our losses in future\nperiods will be significant. Also, we have in the past and may in the future find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate, as\nour business plan is dependent upon our ability to successfully launch satellites and build the SpaceMobile Service, but also to control costs. The\ndesign, manufacture and launch of satellite systems are highly complex and historically have been subject to frequent delays and cost over-runs. The\nnature of our business thus requires us to regularly reevaluate our business plans and forecasts, and any prior projections should be disregarded\nunless otherwise indicated. Given the novelty of our business, there is no guarantee that our capital needs will not increase, and such increases may\nbe substantial.\nAny debt we incur may be either unsecured or secured. To the extent that we incur such debt in the future, such creditors would have the right to\nreceive payment on account of such debt in a bankruptcy or liquidation prior to equityholders receiving any payments and if secured, would have a\nsecurity interest in all or certain of our assets.\nThere can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when needed,\nour financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, despite our recent financing transactions, our need for capital in the future may result in our independent auditors or management\nexpressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in future financial statements. If we were to receive a going concern\nqualification in our financial statements, the trading price of our Class A Common Stock could be significantly negatively impacted.\nExercise of outstanding warrants to purchase our Class A Common Stock and any conversion of our Notes will result in dilution to our\nstockholders.\nAs of March 28, 2024, there are 17,597,600 outstanding warrants to purchase 17,597,600 shares of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price\nof $11.50 per share, which may be exercised at any time. Additionally, the holders of our Notes may at their option convert the Notes (subject to\ncertain exceptions) at any time on or after January 16, 2025 or prior to January 16, 2025 in the event that we undergo a fundamental change at the\ninitial conversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price\nof $5.75 per share of Class A Common Stock). As of March 28, 2024 such amount is the equivalent of 19,130,435 and represents the number of\nClass A Common Stock convertible\n33\non the $110.0 million currently outstanding. To the extent such warrants are exercised, and/or notes are converted, additional shares of our Class A\nCommon Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our Class A Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible\nfor resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such dilution is possible could\nadversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nAs a holding company, we will depend on the ability of AST LLC to make distributions to us.\nWe are a holding company and do not have any significant operations or assets other than our ownership of partnership interests in AST LLC.\nDistributions from AST LLC will be our primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements, including future debt service payments, if any,\nand other expenses. The inability of AST LLC to make distributions in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the\nholding company level could have an adverse effect on our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders if our board of directors\ndetermined to do so in the future and/or meet our debt service obligations, if any.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and certain rules imposed by regulatory authorities may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third-\nparty.\nOur Bylaws require, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our\nbehalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii)\nany action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Second Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Charter”) or Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees\ngoverned by the internal affairs doctrine may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any claim (a) as to which\nthe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of\nChancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within 10 days following such\ndetermination), (b) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (c) for which the Court of\nChancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (d) any action arising under the Securities Act, as to which the Court of Chancery and the\nfederal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction. If an action is brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder\nbringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder’s counsel. Although we believe this provision benefits\nus by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this\nprovision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is enforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and\nofficers, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations\nthereunder.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, our Bylaws provide that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability\ncreated by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates\nexclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations\nthereunder. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of\nlawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. For more information, see\n“Description of Capital Stock.”\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe market price and trading volume of our securities may be volatile.\nSecurities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or\npolitical conditions, could reduce the market price of our Class A Common Stock in spite of our operating performance. We cannot assure you that\nthe market price of our Class A Common Stock will not fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors,\nincluding, among others, the following:\n• the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this report;\n• developments involving our competitors;\n• variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors in general;\n• difficult global market and economic conditions;\n• loss of investor confidence in the global financial markets and investing in general;\n• inability to attract, retain or motivate our directors, officers or other key personnel;\n34\n• adverse market reaction to indebtedness we may incur, securities we may grant under our 2020 Plan or otherwise, or any other securities we\nmay issue in the future, including shares of Class A Common Stock;\n• failure to meet securities analysts’ earnings estimates;\n• publication of negative or inaccurate research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to provide adequate\ncoverage of the Class A Common Stock in the future;\n• speculation in the press or investment community about our business;\n• additions and departures of key employees and personnel;\n• competition for talent and skill-sets required;\n• commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n• the volume of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for public sale;\n• additional or unexpected changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or\nenforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n• increases in compliance or enforcement inquiries and investigations by regulatory authorities, including as a result of regulations mandated\nby the Dodd-Frank Act and other initiatives of various regulators that have jurisdiction over us; and\n• adverse publicity about our industry.\n35\nInformation available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media\nmay include statements not attributable to the Company and may not be reliable or accurate.\nWe have received, and may continue to receive, a high degree of media coverage that is published or otherwise disseminated by third parties,\nincluding blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media. This includes coverage that is not attributable to statements made by our\nofficers or associates. Information provided by third parties may not be reliable or accurate, may travel quickly through social media, and could\nmaterially impact the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe may be subject to litigation, including securities class action litigation or other claims relating to our business operations, which may harm\nour reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We are already a\nparty to securities class action litigation and may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in\nsubstantial costs and damages, and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may also be called on to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business operations. Some of these claims may seek significant\ndamage amounts due to the nature of our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome\nof any such proceedings. A future on-payment outcome in a legal proceeding could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. Also, current and future litigation, regardless of its merits, could result in substantial legal fees, settlement or judgment costs\nand a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nOur outstanding warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our warrants could have a material effect on our financial\nresults.\nOn April 12, 2021, the Acting Chief Accountant and Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance of the SEC issued a Staff Statement on\nAccounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SPACs”) (the “SEC Staff Statement”).\nThe SEC Staff Statement sets forth the conclusion of the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant that certain provisions included in the warrant\nagreements entered into by many special purpose acquisition companies require such warrants to be accounted for as liabilities measured at fair\nvalue, rather than as equity securities, with changes in fair value during each financial reporting period reported in earnings. As a result of the SEC\nStaff Statement, we reevaluated the accounting treatment of our warrants, and determined to classify the warrants as derivative liabilities measured\nat fair value, with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings.\nAs a result, included on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 contained elsewhere in this report are derivative\nliabilities related to embedded features contained within our warrants. ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), provides for the\nremeasurement of the fair value of such derivatives at each balance sheet date, with a resulting non-cash gain or loss related to the change in the fair\nvalue being recognized in earnings in the statement of operations. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, our consolidated financial\nstatements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly, based on factors which are outside of our control. Due to the recurring fair value\nmeasurement, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or\nlosses could be material.\nAn active trading market for our securities may not be maintained.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market for our Class A Common Stock on Nasdaq or any other\nexchange in the future. If an active market for our securities is not maintained, or if we fail to satisfy the Nasdaq continued listing standards for any\nreason and our securities are delisted, it may be difficult for our security holders to sell their securities without depressing the market price for the\nsecurities or at all. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to both raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and acquire other\ncomplementary products, services, technologies or businesses by using our shares of capital stock as consideration.\n36\nSecurities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause\nour stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe trading market for our securities is influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and\nour business. We do not control these analysts, and the analysts who publish information about our company may have relatively little experience\nwith us or our industry, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their\nestimates. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or on-payment\nresearch or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or\nfail to publish reports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to\ndecline.\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.\nOur business is sensitive to general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Slower global economic growth, credit market crises, high\nlevels of unemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, government deficit reduction, changes in inflation and interest rate environments,\nsequestration and other austerity measures and other challenges affecting the global economy adversely affects us and our distributors, customers,\nand suppliers. It is uncertain how long these effects will last or whether economic and financial trends will worsen or improve. Changes in economic\nconditions and supply chain constraints and steps taken by governments and central banks could lead to higher inflation than previously experienced\nor expected, which could, in turn, lead to an increase in costs. In an inflationary environment, we may experience increased operating costs. Such\nuncertain economic times may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and, if circumstances worsen, our\nability to raise capital at reasonable rates. If slower growth in the global economy continues for a significant period, if there is significant\ndeterioration in the global economy or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial\ncondition could be adversely affected.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity risk management and strategy\nOur cybersecurity risk management strategy and processes, which are integrated into our overall risk management process, for assessing, identifying\nand managing material risks from cybersecurity threats are designed based on established frameworks and standards developed by the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”). Although this does not mean that we currently meet all technical standards, specifications, or\nrequirements, we use this framework, complemented by insights from internal assessments, to guide the development of policies governing the use\nof our information assets, access to intellectual property, and the safeguarding of personal information.\nWe regularly assess the threat landscape and take a holistic view of cybersecurity risks, with a layered cybersecurity defense strategy based on\nprevention, detection and containment. We employ industry standard measures directly or indirectly related to cybersecurity, such as multifactor\nauthentication, endpoint protection defenses, antivirus protection, encryption standards, restricting access based on business necessity, and remote\naccess monitoring. Our employees undergo regular cybersecurity awareness training, receive guidance on protecting confidential information, and\nparticipate in simulated phishing exercises. The training provides employees with a baseline understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals to prevent\nsecurity breaches and safely identify potential threats. We engage third parties to conduct penetration testing and evaluate our adherence to industry-\nstandard frameworks. We assess the security framework employed by our third party service providers including their reports on security,\navailability and confidentiality to assess and identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third party applications. We\nhave also established liaison programs with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n(“CISA”) to monitor, identify, and counter advanced persistent threats specific to our company and industry. As part of this program, we have an\nFBI Special Agent assigned as our Liaison Officer who provides us with periodic cybersecurity threat briefings, and also provides counter-threat\nsupport on request.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats (including any previous cybersecurity incidents) that have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, financial condition or results of operations. For further details\non cybersecurity risks, please refer to the Risk Factors discussion in Item 1A of this Report, including the discussion under the heading\n“Cyberattacks impacting our networks or systems may have a material effect on our operations.”\n37\nGovernance of cybersecurity risk management\nOur Board of Directors, acting through the Audit Committee, is responsible for overseeing management’s implementation and execution of the risk\nmanagement process, including our cybersecurity risk management strategy and processes. Our Audit Committee reviews and deliberates on our\nrisk assessment and risk management practices, including cybersecurity risks, in collaboration with management.\nManagement bears the responsibility for the day-to-day assessment and management of cybersecurity risks. We have formed a Cyber Security\nIncident Response Team (“CSIRT”) to manage and govern the response to any real or suspected cybersecurity incidents. The CSIRT core team,\nconsisting of the information technology team, classifies detected cybersecurity incidents into one of three categories based on potential impact to\nthe functionality of the affected systems, possible or known information involved and recoverability effort. The classification of cybersecurity\nincidents is designed to allow rapid prioritization, response and escalation. The CSIRT core team engages with third party experts and cross-\nfunctional CSIRT members, as required, to manage the cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity incidents that are potentially significant or could\nresult in a material impact are reported to the CSIRT Executive team, consisting of designated executives of the Company. The CSIRT Executive\nteam is responsible for the oversight of the cybersecurity incidents and related critical decisions, performing a materiality assessment, overseeing the\npublic disclosure of material cybersecurity matters, engaging law enforcement agencies, including our local FBI Liaison Officer, correspondence\nwith the media, and communicating with our Audit Committee and Board of Directors, as appropriate.\nItem 2.

Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated.\nIn the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of\nany recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although\nmanagement considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting\nperiod for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected. Refer to Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for\nfurther information.\n38\nDelaware Class Action Litigations\nFollowing books and records demands pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220, two stockholders have filed putative class action complaints in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery against the Company, certain current and former directors of the Company and its predecessor entity and manager, New\nProvidence Acquisition Corp. and New Providence Management LLC, and Abel Avellan, alleging claims of breach of fiduciary duties and aiding\nand abetting such breaches, relating to the de-SPAC merger. The first of those complaints, Taylor v. Coleman, et al. (C.A. No. 2023-1292), was filed\non December 27, 2023, and the second, Drulias v. New Providence Management LLC, et al., was filed on March 29, 2024 (collectively, the\n“Delaware Stockholder Class Actions”). Both complaints seek equitable relief and unspecified monetary damages.

Unless\notherwise indicated, all references to “dollars” and “$” in this Annual Report are to, and all monetary amounts in this Annual Report are presented\nin, U.S. dollars.\nOverview\nWe are building the first and only global Cellular Broadband network in space to be accessible directly by everyday smartphones (2G/4G-LTE/5G\ndevices) for commercial use, and other applications for government use utilizing our extensive intellectual property (“IP”) and patent portfolio. Our\nSpaceMobile Service is being designed to provide cost-effective, high-speed Cellular Broadband services to end-users who are out of terrestrial\ncellular coverage using existing mobile devices. The SpaceMobile Service currently is planned to be provided by a constellation of high-powered,\nlarge phased-array satellites in Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”) using low band and middle band spectrum controlled by Mobile Network Operators\n(“MNOs”). We are headquartered in Texas where we operate 185,000 square feet satellite assembly, integrating and testing (“AIT”) facilities. Our IP\nportfolio is diverse, containing numerous and various innovations of the direct-to-cell satellite ecosystem from space to Earth. Our IP portfolio\nconsists of 36 patent families worldwide. As of December 31, 2023, we had more than 3,350 patent and patent pending claims worldwide, of which\napproximately 1,050 have been officially granted or allowed.\nWe intend to work with MNOs to offer the SpaceMobile Service to the MNOs’ end-user customers. Our vision is that users will not need to\nsubscribe to the SpaceMobile Service directly through us, nor will they need to purchase any new or additional equipment. Instead, users will be\nable to access the SpaceMobile Service when prompted on their mobile device that they are no longer within range of the land-based facilities of the\nMNO operator or will be able to purchase a plan directly with their existing mobile provider. We intend to seek to use a revenue-sharing business\nmodel for SpaceMobile Service in our agreements with MNOs.\nThe SpaceMobile Service is expected to be highly attractive to MNOs as it will enable them to improve and differentiate their service offering\nwithout significant incremental capital investments. The SpaceMobile Service is expected to enable MNOs to augment and extend their coverage\nwithout building towers or other land-based infrastructure, including where it is not cost-justified or is difficult due to geographical challenges. As a\nresult of the incremental coverage created by the planned SpaceMobile Service, we believe that MNOs will have the opportunity to increase\nsubscribers’ average revenue per user (“ARPU”).\nOn April 1, 2019, we launched our first test satellite, BW1, which was used to validate our satellite to cellular architecture and was capable of\nmanaging communications delays from LEO and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol.\nWe launched our BlueWalker 3 (“BW3”) test satellite on September 10, 2022, and announced the completion of the deployment of the\ncommunication phased array antenna of the BW3 test satellite in orbit on November 14, 2022. On April 25, 2023, we announced that we had\nsuccessfully completed two-way voice calls directly to standard unmodified smartphones using the BW3 test satellite. On June 21, 2023, we\nannounced that we had achieved repeated successful 4G download speeds of above 10 megabits per second (“Mbps”) to standard unmodified\nsmartphones using the BW3 test satellite. On September 19, 2023, we announced that we had achieved repeated successful two-way voice calls\ndirectly to standard unmodified smartphones using 5G connectivity and successful download speeds of approximately 14 Mbps utilizing 5\nmegahertz (“Mhz”) of low band spectrum via the BW3 test satellite. We intend to continue testing capabilities of the BW3 test satellite, including\nfurther testing with cellular service providers and devices.\n41\nWe are currently in the advanced stages of assembling and testing our first generation of commercial BB satellites (“Block 1 BB satellites”). We are\nleveraging skills, know-how and technological expertise derived from the design and assembly of our BW3 test satellite in the development and\nassembly of our BB satellite platform. The Block 1 BB satellites will be of similar size and weight to the BW3 test satellite, includes our own\ndesigned array solar panels and battery systems, and will have ten times higher throughput than the BW3 test satellite. The completion of five Block\n1 BB satellites has been delayed as compared to our target completion timeline due to a delay in the commencement of integration and testing of\nfive Block 1 BB satellites. The failure by suppliers of two key subsystems to meet their contractual delivery timelines contributed to this delay. To\nmitigate such risks in the future and reduce our dependency on these suppliers, we have reached an agreement with the supplier of one of the\nsubsystems and obtained a non-exclusive and worldwide license of the design and manufacturing rights of this subsystem for use in our Block 2 BB\nsatellites. We have also replaced the supplier of the other subsystem with a new supplier with whom we have completed a new design and own the\nIP of this subsystem. The new supplier will manufacture and supply this subsystem for use in our Block 2 BB satellites at a cost that is expected to\nbe materially lower than the current cost of this subsystem. We expect these subsystems to not delay the timely completion of future BB satellites.\nWe currently estimate we will transport the five Block 1 BB satellites from our assembly facilities to the launch site between July and August of\n2024 to await a launch window. This launch window will be disclosed once a window can be agreed upon. The exact timing of the new launch\nschedule will be contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of assembly, integrating and testing of the\nsatellites, regulatory approvals, launch provider availability, logistics, weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe have a contractual right under the launch services agreement to reschedule the date of our dedicated launch, subject to the launch vehicle\nprovider’s launch schedule availability and payment of a change fee.\nThe SpaceMobile Service has not been launched and therefore has not yet generated any revenue. Following the launch and deployment of five\nBlock 1 BB satellites, we currently plan to initiate a limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service in targeted geographical areas, including in the\nUnited States, and seek to generate revenue from such service. We are expanding our efforts on ground infrastructure development for commercial\nreadiness and integrating our SpaceMobile service into the MNOs’ infrastructure to enable us to initiate commercial services. Prior to initiating such\nservice, we will need to obtain regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we would provide such service and would need to enter into\ndefinitive agreements with MNOs relating to the offering of such service in each jurisdiction. We expect to enter into commercial agreements with\nMNOs for the use of our five Block 1 BB satellites, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into these agreements\non terms acceptable to us or at all. In 2024, we expect to begin generating revenue from the resale of gateway equipment and associated services to\nMNOs and other third parties, and from completing defined milestones under an agreement with a prime contractor for the U.S. government. We\nbelieve initiation of limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service as well as completing the milestones under the agreement with a prime contractor\nfor the U.S. government will help to demonstrate the advantages of our satellite-based Cellular Broadband service in the market. These market\nactivities will commence while we continue the development and testing of the next generation of BB satellites.\nOur next generation of commercial BB satellites (“Block 2 BB satellites”) are expected to derive greater performance through the introduction of\nour own AST5000 Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”) chip, which we believe will enable materially greater throughput capacity of up\nto 40 MHz per beam to support 120 Mbps peak data rates and up to 10,000 MHz of processing bandwidth per Block 2 BB satellite, require less\npower and offer a lower overall unit cost. We have completed the design and have commenced the tape-out of our ASIC chip in March 2024. The\nBlock 2 BB satellites are expected to be approximately 2,400 square feet in size, almost 3.5 times bigger than the Block 1 BB satellites, and will\nhave the largest phased array ever deployed in a LEO for commercial use exceeding the phased array of the BW3 test satellite and planned Block 1\nBB satellites. We believe the larger aperture array is expected to provide greater spectrum reuse, enhanced signal strength and increased capacity,\nthereby reducing the necessary number of satellites to achieve service coverage as compared to smaller apertures.\nWe continue to make progress towards the completion of the design and development of our Block 2 BB satellites. We believe we will benefit from\nthe skills, technological expertise, and manufacturing know-how derived from the assembly and testing of our Block 1 BB satellite in the\ndevelopment and assembly of our Block 2 BB satellites. We began the design and development of the Block 2 BB satellites prior to the design and\ndevelopment of Block 1 BB satellites. We have commenced planning and procurement activities to begin the assembly, integration and testing of the\nBlock 2 BB satellites and have entered into agreements and placed orders for procurement of materials required for manufacturing the satellite\ncomponents, and subsystems required for the assembly of Block 2 BB satellites. We plan to continue to manufacture the satellite components and\nsubsystems for Block 2 BB satellites as soon as the assembly and testing of Block 1 BB satellites are complete. The first Block 2 BB satellite will be\nbased on a FPGA chip and future Block 2 BB satellites will use the ASIC chip. We have entered into an agreement with a launch service provider to\nlaunch the first Block 2 BB satellite. The agreement has a launch window of December 15, 2024 to March 31, 2025. The exact timing of this launch\nis contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of the design, assembly and testing of the Block 2 BB satellite,\nregulatory approvals, availability of launch windows by the launch providers,\n42\nlogistics, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We have a contractual right under the launch services agreement to reschedule\nthe date of our dedicated launch, subject to the launch vehicle provider’s launch schedule availability.\nWe are developing a phased satellite deployment plan and corresponding commercial launch plan of the SpaceMobile Service based on targeted\ngeographical areas to provide the SpaceMobile Service to the most commercially attractive MNO markets. This prioritization of coverage is\ndesigned to minimize the capital required to initiate and operate commercial service that generates cash flows from operating activities sooner. We\nexpect that such a successful commercial service would enable us to attract additional capital to continue to assemble and launch additional BB\nsatellites to expand our capacity and geographic coverage area, although there can be no assurance that such capital would be available on terms\nacceptable to us, or at all.\nWe plan to achieve substantial service in the selected, targeted geographical areas with the launch and operation of 25 BB satellites and achieve\nsubstantial service in all targeted geographical areas to meet our long term business goals with the launch and operation of approximately 95 BB\nsatellites. We anticipate launching and deploying additional satellites beyond the initial 95 satellites in order to enhance coverage and system\ncapacity in response to incremental market demand. Our current plan is subject to numerous uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding satisfactory and timely completion of assembly and testing of the satellites, availability of launch windows by the launch providers, our\nability to raise capital, proposed orbits and resulting satellite coverage, launch costs, ability to enter into agreements with MNOs, regulatory\napprovals, and other factors. We may adopt a strategy for commercial launch of the SpaceMobile Service, including the nature and type of services\noffered and the geographic areas where we may launch such services, that may differ materially from our current plan.\nWe are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth\ncompanies. Please refer to Risk Factors contained in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report.\nRecent Developments\nConvertible Security Investment Agreement\nOn January 16, 2024, we entered into a Convertible Security Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with AT&T, Google and\nVodafone (the “Investors”) to issue subordinated convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million (such notes, the “Notes” and\nsuch investments, the “Investments”) to the Investors. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears\nbeginning on June 30, 2024, in cash or in kind at our option. The Notes have a ten-year term unless earlier converted.\nThe holders of the Notes (the “Holders”) may at their option convert the Notes (subject to certain exceptions) at any time on or after January 16,\n2025 at an initial conversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial\nconversion price of $5.75 per share of Class A Common Stock). On or after January 16, 2025, we also have an option to require the Holders to\nconvert the Notes (subject to certain exceptions) at the same initial conversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000\nprincipal amount of Notes if the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for 30\nconsecutive trading days, on the immediately succeeding trading day after the last trading day of such 30 day period. The Notes may be accelerated\nupon the occurrence of certain events of default and fundamental change. Refer to Note 17: Subsequent events in the accompanying notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further information.\nLetter Agreements\nOn January 16, 2024, in connection with the Investments, each of AT&T Services, Inc. (“AT&T Services”), Google and Vodafone Group Services\nhave entered into letter agreements with us (the “Letter Agreements”).\nThe letter agreement between AT&T Services and us provides, among other things, that AT&T Services will make a non-refundable $20.0 million\ncommercial payment for prepaid service revenue, creditable against our future service revenue, due after the launch and successful initial operation\nof the first five commercial satellites. AT&T Services also submitted a purchase order under a separate agreement for purchase of network\nequipment from us to support planned commercial service. Under the letter agreement, we are required to use reasonable best efforts to cause our\nStockholders’ Agreement, dated April 6, 2021 to be amended such that AT&T Services shall have the right to nominate, and the parties to such\nStockholders’ Agreement agree to vote for and cause the appointment of, any representative of AT&T Services that it determines in its sole\ndiscretion to (i) serve as a non-voting observer to our board of directors or (ii) serve as a director to our board of directors.\n43\nWe entered into a letter agreement with Google whereby the parties will negotiate and execute a definitive agreement to provide, among other\nthings, certain services to each other and have agreed to collaborate on product development, testing and implementation plans for SpaceMobile\nnetwork connectivity on Android devices.\nThe letter agreement between Vodafone Group Services and us provides, among other things, for an initial revenue commitment of $25.0 million to\nus to be paid by Vodafone Group Services over a two and a half year period to be defined in a future definitive agreement for us to provide\nconnectivity services. Vodafone also submitted a purchase order for purchase of network equipment from us to support planned commercial service.\nJanuary 2024 Common Stock Offering\nOn January 23, 2024, we issued 32,258,064 shares of Class A Common Stock in a public offering and received proceeds of $93.6 million, net of\nunderwriting commissions of $6.0 million and transaction costs of $0.4 million. We provided a 30-day option to the underwriting agent to purchase\nup to an additional 4,838,709 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Option Shares”) from us on the same terms and conditions. On January 25,\n2024, the Option Shares were exercised in full. The offering of the Option Shares closed on January 29, 2024 for proceeds of $14.1 million, net of\nunderwriting commissions of $0.9 million. Proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock under the January 2024 Common Stock Offering\nwere and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.\nImpact of Global Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Conflicts\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including heightened inflation, changes to fiscal and monetary policies,\nhigher interest rates, volatility in the capital markets, supply chain challenges, and geopolitical conflicts on all aspects of our business across\ngeographies, including how it has and may continue to impact our operations, workforce, suppliers, and our ability to raise additional capital to fund\noperating and capital expenditures.\nChanges in the prices of satellite materials due to inflation, supply chain challenges, and other macroeconomic factors may affect our capital costs\nestimates to build and launch the satellite constellation and adversely affect our financial condition. The extent of impact of these factors on our\nbusiness will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time. To date, these factors\nhave not had a material impact to our technology development efforts or results of our operations. However, if macroeconomic conditions\ndeteriorate or there are unforeseen developments, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe operate from multiple locations that include our corporate headquarters and 185,000 square feet AIT facilities in Texas where the final AIT is\nperformed, and engineering and development centers elsewhere in the United States, India, Scotland, Spain and Israel. Our operations in Israel\nconstitute approximately 5% of the consolidated total assets and approximately 12% of consolidated total operating expenses of the Company. To\ndate, our operations in Israel have not been materially impacted by the geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. We currently do not expect potential\ninterruptions to our operations in Israel to have a material impact on the Company.\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Our Future Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations\nOur historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be driven by our ability to execute on our\nstrategy. Our future results of operations could differ materially from the historical results of operations as we expect to complete the assembly and\nlaunch the five Block 1 BB satellites, initiate the limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service in certain targeted geographical areas, fulfill our\nobligations under the contracts for gateway stations and under an agreement with a prime contractor of a U.S. government contract, complete the\ntape-out of our ASIC chip, set up ground cellular and infrastructure for commercial readiness, complete the design of the Block 2 BB satellites,\ncommence the assembly, integration and testing of the Block 2 BB satellites, and launch the first Block 2 BB satellite.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from our SpaceMobile Service. All revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022 were generated\nfrom sales and services by our former subsidiary, Nano. Following the completion of the sale of Nano on September 6, 2022, we did not generate\nany revenue. Following the launch and deployment of five Block 1 BB satellites, we currently plan to initiate a limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile\nService in targeted geographical areas, including in the United States, subject to obtaining regulatory approval and negotiating and executing\ndefinitive agreements with MNOs, and seek to\n44\ngenerate revenue from such service. In 2024, we expect to begin generating revenue from the resale of gateway equipment and associated services to\nMNOs and other third parties, and from completing defined milestones under an agreement with a prime contractor for a U.S. government contract.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales during the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of the costs incurred to fulfill Nano’s sales contracts. Following the completion of\nthe sale of Nano on September 6, 2022, we did not incur any costs of sales. We do not expect to generate revenue and incur associated cost of sales\nin future periods until we launch the SpaceMobile Service and/or begin to generate revenue from the resale of gateway equipment and associated\nservices to MNOs and third parties, and meet future milestones under the agreement with a prime contractor for a U.S. government contract.\nEngineering Services Costs\nEngineering services costs are charged to expense as incurred. Engineering services costs consist primarily of the cost of employees and consultants\ninvolved in the design and development of the BB satellites, managing the network and satellite operations centers, and indirect costs related to the\nassembly, integration and testing of the BB satellites, license cost, and general expenses related to AIT facilities and engineering development\ncenters.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nGeneral and administrative costs include the costs of insurance, cost of non-engineering personnel and personnel related expenses, software\nlicensing and subscriptions, office and facilities expenses, investor relations, and professional services, including public relations, accounting and\nlegal fees.\nResearch and Development Costs\nR&D costs are charged to expense as incurred. R&D costs consist principally of development activities in which we typically engage third-party\nvendors and are largely driven by the achievement of milestones that trigger payments and costs of materials in supplies consumed in the\ndevelopment activities. R&D costs are expected to fluctuate quarter over quarter depending on achievement of milestones.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation expense related to property and equipment including the BW3 test satellite, as well as\ndefinite lived intangible assets. We began depreciating the BW3 test satellite as of April 25, 2023 over its expected remaining useful life of\napproximately 16 months.\nGain (Loss) on Remeasurement of Warrant Liabilities\nPublic Warrants and Private Placement Warrants issued by us are accounted for as liability-classified instruments at their initial fair value on the date\nof issuance. They are remeasured on each balance sheet date and changes in the estimated fair value are recognized as an unrealized gain or loss in\nthe consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing demand deposit accounts, net of any\ninterest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our debt arrangements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of non-operating expense and income, including foreign exchange gains or losses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAST LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Also, we had a controlling ownership interest in our former\nsubsidiary, Nano, a Lithuanian company, through September 6, 2022, that is subject to foreign income taxes and is also treated as a partnership for\nU.S. federal and state and local taxes. Accordingly, all income, losses, and other tax attributes pass through to the members’ income tax returns, and\nno U.S. federal and state and local provision for income taxes has been\n45\nrecorded for AST LLC in the consolidated financial statements. Certain foreign wholly-owned entities are taxed as corporations in the jurisdictions\nin which they operate, and accruals for such taxes are included in the consolidated financial statements.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nNoncontrolling interest primarily represents the equity interest in AST LLC held by members other than us. As of December 31, 2023,\nnoncontrolling interest in AST LLC was approximately 58.7%. For the year ended December 31, 2022, noncontrolling interest also included\napproximately 49.0% equity interests in our former subsidiary, Nano, held by equityholders other than us. On September 6, 2022, the noncontrolling\ninterest was eliminated in connection with the sale of the Company’s 51% interest in Nano. We attributed a portion of net income or loss generated\nat AST LLC and Nano to the noncontrolling interest based on their ownership interests.\nResults of Operations\nWe report our results of operations under one operating segment. The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of\noperations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands) and the discussion that follows compares the year ended December 31,\n2023, to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nRevenues $ - $ 13,825 $ (13,825) (100) %\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below) - 6,714 (6,714) (100)\nGross profit - 7,111 (7,111) (100)\nOperating expenses:\nEngineering services 78,811 54,212 24,599 45\nGeneral and administrative costs 41,601 48,332 (6,731) (14)\nResearch and development costs 47,486 45,620 1,866 4\nDepreciation and amortization 54,469 4,711 49,758 1,056\nTotal operating expenses 222,367 152,875 69,492 45\nOther income (expense):\nGain on remeasurement of warrant liabilities 8,986 19,114 (10,128) (53)\nInterest income (expense), net 2,675 2,633 42 2\nOther (expense) income, net (10,290) 21,521 (31,811) (148)\nTotal other income (expense), net 1,371 43,268 (41,897) (97)\nLoss before income tax expense (220,996) (102,496) (118,500) 116\nIncome tax expense (1,681) (617) (1,064) 172\nNet loss before allocation to noncontrolling interest (222,677) (103,113) (119,564) 116\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (135,116) (71,473) (63,643) 89\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (87,561) $ (31,640) $ (55,921) 177 %\nRevenues\nAll revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022 were generated from sales and services provided by our former subsidiary, Nano. Following\nthe completion of the sale of Nano on September 6, 2022, we no longer generated revenue.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales during the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of the costs incurred to fulfill Nano’s sales contracts. Following the completion of\nthe sale of Nano on September 6, 2022, we no longer generated revenue and incurred associated cost of sales.\n46\nEngineering Services Costs\nTotal engineering services costs increased by $24.6 million, or 45%, to $78.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a $10.5 million increase in payroll and employee related costs, including\nstock-based compensation expense, due to an increase in headcount and milestones bonuses paid upon achievement of certain milestones, an\nincrease of $10.2 million in AIT facilities and activities and engineering development centers costs including managing mission operations and\nground infrastructure and travel expenses, and an increase of $3.9 million in indirect costs associated with testing and production activities.\nGeneral and Administrative Costs\nTotal general and administrative costs decreased by $6.7 million, or 14%, to $41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven by elimination of $5.7 million of costs related to Nano as Nano is no longer consolidated\nfollowing its sale in September 2022, and a net decrease of $1.0 million in travel expenses and other miscellaneous expenses.\nResearch and Development Costs\nTotal R&D costs increased by $1.9 million, or 4%, to $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December\n31, 2022. R&D costs during the year ended December 31, 2023 were incurred primarily for completing the design and development of BB Block 1\nsatellites, progressing the design and development of certain subsystems for the BB Block 2 satellites, completing the IP design of our ASIC chip,\nand continued development of ground infrastructure programs for commercial readiness. R&D costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 were\nincurred primarily for the design and development of the BB Block 2 satellites and developing our ASIC chip. The increase in R&D costs was\nprimarily driven by increases for the design and development of the BB Block 1 satellites and the development of ground infrastructure programs\nfor commercial readiness, which were offset by completing the IP design of our ASIC chip and reduced expenditure on the design and development\nof certain subsystems for the BB Block 2 satellites during the current period.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense increased by $49.8 million, or 1,056%, to $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to commencing depreciation of the BW3 test satellite from April\n25, 2023, the date on which we determined that BW3 had met its intended use.\nGain on Remeasurement of Warrant Liabilities\nDecrease in fair value of warrant liabilities resulted in a gain of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the gain of $19.1\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nTotal interest income (expense), net increased by less than $0.1 million, or 2%, to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by an increase of $4.3 million in interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents\nheld in interest bearing demand deposit accounts, partially offset by an increase of $4.2 million in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance\ncosts incurred in connection with our debt arrangements.\nOther (Expense) Income, net\nTotal other (expense) income, net was $(10.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $21.5 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease of $31.8 million was primarily due to the net gain of $24.6 million recognized in connection with the sale of Nano\nin 2022, a payment of $10.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 to a related party in accordance with the contractual agreement, partially offset by\n$1.4 million of transaction costs incurred in connection with the Equity Line of Credit (as defined herein) in 2022 and a decrease of $1.4 million in\nother non-operating income and foreign exchange loss.\n47\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for income taxes was $1.7 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The consolidated\neffective tax rate for years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was (1%). Refer to Note 14: Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements for further information.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $135.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $71.5 million in the year\nended December 31, 2022. This increase in net loss correlates with the increase in net loss generated at AST LLC given the noncontrolling interest\nrepresents a portion of such net loss.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur current sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and access to equity programs currently in place, which consist of an Equity\nLine of Credit (as defined herein) and the ATM Program (as defined herein). As of December 31, 2023, we had $88.1 million of cash and cash\nequivalents on hand, including $2.5 million of restricted cash. In January 2024, we raised net proceeds of $107.7 million from the issuance of Class\nA Common Stock through our Common Stock Offering and $110.0 million from the issuance of convertible notes under the Convertible Security\nInvestment Agreement. We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, which is estimated at $210.8 million as of March 31, 2024, and our\nability to raise capital through access to the Equity Line of Credit and the ATM Equity Program, will be sufficient to meet our current working\ncapital needs, planned operating expenses and capital expenditures for a period of the next 12 months from the date of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nThe design, assembly, integration, testing and launch of satellites and related ground infrastructure is capital intensive. We currently estimate the\ncapital expenditure, primarily direct materials and launch costs, required for the assembly, integration, testing and launch of the five Block 1 BB\nsatellites to be approximately $115.0 million, and we have paid over 90% of this expenditure as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We\ncurrently believe that the estimated average capital costs, consisting primarily of direct materials and launch costs, required for the assembly,\nintegration, testing and launch of a constellation of 95 Block 2 BB satellites to be approximately $16.0 million to $18.0 million per satellite. The\nestimated capital cost per Block 2 BB satellite is based on a number of factors, including securing launch contracts with more favorable terms, bulk\nordering of parts and components, cost reductions due to the benefits of economies of scale and process improvements, and other factors. If we are\nunable to achieve these cost reductions, process improvements, and favorable launch contracts, the average capital cost of the Block 2 BB satellites\nwill be higher and such variations could be material.\nWe believe we need to launch and operate 25 BB satellites (five Block 1 BB satellites and 20 Block 2 BB satellites) in order to provide coverage to\nthe most commercially attractive MNO markets. In addition to the cash and cash equivalents we had on hand as of March 28, 2024, we currently\nestimate we will need to raise approximately $350.0 million to $400.0 million to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures necessary to\ndesign, assemble and launch 20 Block 2 BB satellites and operate a constellation of 25 BB satellites.\nWe evaluate our market, product and coverage plans based upon the attractiveness of certain markets, our technology, regulatory concerns and our\naccess to capital and other resources. We believe we can develop satellite configurations which target delivering service to certain attractive markets\nwithout the necessity of building a constellation which covers the entire globe. This modularity of our satellite configuration enables us to alter the\ntiming and size of our satellite roll out and provides us flexibility to dynamically change our market plans and capital requirements. As a result, we\nbelieve we have the ability to accelerate or slow down our business plan depending upon the availability of capital to support our strategies.\nWe plan to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities (secured or unsecured), secured or unsecured loans\nor other debt facilities, and credit from government or financial institutions or commercial partners, including through our existing Equity Line of\nCredit and the ATM Equity Program. We also intend to seek to draw the remaining available credit under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Our\nability to access the capital markets during this period of volatility may require us to modify our current expectations. There can be no assurance that\nadditional funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when needed in the future, our financial\ncondition, results of operations, business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n48\nCommitments\nThe following table summarizes the contractual minimum principal and interest payments required on all of our outstanding debt and operating\nleases by period due date, as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nPayments Due by Period\nThereafte\nContractual Obligations 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 r Total\nDebt $ 252 $ 2,920 $ 55,125 $ 2,466 $ 5,363 $ 5,655 $ 71,781\nOperating leases 3,078 2,909 2,541 2,326 2,269 8,867 21,990\nContractual interest on debt 8,922 8,760 5,697 958 766 45 25,148\nTotal contractual obligations $ 12,252 $ 14,589 $ 63,363 $ 5,750 $ 8,398 $ 14,567 $ 118,919\nAlso, as of December 31, 2023, we had contractual commitments with third parties in the aggregate amount of $13.5 million related to procurement\nof BB satellite components, certain R&D programs, and capital improvements. We expect these commitments will continue to increase as we make\nprogress to assemble, integrate and test Block 2 BB satellites, and enter into launch agreements for the launch of Block 2 BB satellites.\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreement\nOn May 6, 2022, we entered into the Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Common Stock Purchase Agreement” or “Equity Line of Credit”)\nwith B. Riley Principal Capital, LLC (“B. Riley”) to sell, at our sole discretion, to B. Riley up to $75.0 million of shares of our Class A Common\nStock at 97% of the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Class A Common Stock calculated in accordance with the Common Stock\nPurchase Agreement, over a period of 24 months subject to certain limitations and conditions contained in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement.\nSales and timing of any sales of Class A Common Stock are solely at our election, and we are under no obligation to sell any securities to B. Riley\nunder the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. We plan to raise capital, as and when needed, under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement at our\nsole discretion. Proceeds from the sale of our Class A Common Stock under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement were and will continue to be\nused for general corporate purposes.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nOn September 8, 2022, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Sales Agreement” or “ATM Equity Program”) with Evercore Group\nL.L.C. and B. Riley Securities, Inc. (collectively, the “agents”) to sell shares of our Class A Common Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to\n$150.0 million through an “at the market offering” program under which the agents will act as sales agents. The agents are entitled to total\ncompensation at a commission rate of up to 3.0% of the gross sales price per share sold. We plan to raise capital, as and when needed, under the\nSales Agreement at our sole discretion. Proceeds from the sale of our Class A Common Stock under the Sales Agreement were and will continue to\nbe used for general corporate purposes.\nTerm loan\nIn December 2021, concurrent with the purchase of real property and equipment in Midland, Texas, our wholly-owned subsidiary, AST & Science\nTexas, LLC (“AST Texas”), entered into a credit agreement with Lone Star State Bank of West Texas (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”)\nproviding for a $5.0 million term loan secured by the property. Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 4.20% per\nannum until December 7, 2026, and from December 8, 2026 until December 8, 2028 at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.20% plus adjustment if the\nindex rate as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement is greater than 4.20%, subject to a maximum interest rate of 4.90% per annum. Refer to\nNote 8: Debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default, and certain covenants that limit AST Texas’ ability to, among other\nthings, create liens on collateral, consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets; and enter into certain\ntransactions with their affiliates. If AST Texas fails to perform its obligations under these and other covenants, or should any event of default occur,\nthe term loan may be terminated and any outstanding borrowings, together with unpaid accrued interest, could be declared immediately due and\npayable, and the lender will be authorized to take possession of the collateral.\n49\nSenior secured credit facility\nOn August 14, 2023, we entered into a senior secured term loan credit agreement with ACP Post Oak Credit II LLC as administrative agent and\ncollateral agent and Atlas Credit Partners, LLC (“Atlas”) as lender, providing for a principal loan commitment of up to $100.0 million (the “Atlas\nCredit Agreement”), of which $48.5 million was borrowed upon closing. In addition, a two-year collateral protection insurance policy was issued to\nthe lenders and a cash premium based on a single digit percentage of the amount drawn was paid to the insurance provider thereunder (the “Cash\nPremium”). An additional amount of $51.5 million may be borrowed only to the extent we raise additional capital through equity raises and receive\nadditional insurance coverage such that we have insurance coverage equal to at least the amount of borrowings under the credit facility.\nThe initial borrowings of $48.5 million accrue interest at a fixed rate equal to three-month secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) as of the\nclosing date plus 9.625% per annum equal to 14.75% (the “Atlas Fixed Rate”), payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. The\nborrowing amounts are payable at maturity on August 14, 2026 and are subject to mandatory prepayments upon the occurrence of certain specified\nevents.\nBorrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets other than the assets of certain excluded subsidiaries. The Atlas Credit Agreement contains\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants, requires us to maintain certain levels of liquidity, limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness,\nmake restricted payments (including cash dividends on common stock), and sell or otherwise dispose of our assets, among other restrictions.\nUpon closing, we received net proceeds of $37.2 million, net of debt issuance costs of $9.5 million and deposit of $1.8 million into an interest\nreserve escrow account. Debt issuance costs of $9.5 million consist of agent fees, offering expenses, and two years of cash premium coverage. The\nnet proceeds were and are expected to continue to be used for general corporate purposes as permitted under the Atlas Credit Agreement.\nCapital equipment loan\nOn August 14, 2023, we entered into a loan agreement with Lone Star State Bank of West Texas (“Lone Star”) as lender, providing for $15.0 million\nprincipal term loan commitment secured by certain real property fixtures and equipment in one of our Texas facilities (the “Lone Star Loan\nAgreement”).\nBorrowings accrue interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.75%, subject to a ceiling rate. Interest payments are due and payable on a monthly basis. Interest\npayments began in September 2023 and principal payments will begin in April 2025. Principal repayments are thereafter due in 48 equal monthly\ninstallments until January 2029, the maturity date of the loan. In connection with the Lone Star Loan Agreement, we deposited a cash balance of\n$15.0 million in the Lone Star Bank Money Market Fund. This cash balance will be converted to restricted cash if we fail to maintain a consolidated\nbalance of cash and cash equivalents of at least $75.0 million. This restricted cash will be used to offset against the term loan obligations if we fail to\nmaintain a consolidated balance of cash and cash equivalents of at least $50.0 million. In addition, the Lone Star Loan Agreement includes certain\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants.\nWe drew the entire $15.0 million facility on September 19, 2023 and incurred $0.1 million of transaction costs. The net proceeds were and are\nexpected to continue to be used for general corporate purposes.\nConvertible Security Investment Agreement\nOn January 16, 2024, we entered into a Convertible Security Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with AT&T Venture\nInvestments, LLC (“AT&T”), Google LLC (“Google”) and Vodafone Ventures Limited (“Vodafone”, and together, the “Investors”) to issue\nsubordinated convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million (such notes, the “Notes” and such investments, the\n“Investments”) to the Investors. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears beginning on June 30, 2024, in\ncash or in kind at our option. We intend to elect to pay the contractual interest amount in kind. The Notes have a ten-year term unless earlier\nconverted. The net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.\nThe holders of the Notes (the “Holders”) may at their option convert the Notes (subject to certain exceptions) at any time on or after January 16,\n2025 at an initial conversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial\nconversion price of $5.75 per share of Class A Common Stock). On or after January 16, 2025, we also have an option to require the Holders to\nconvert the Notes (subject to certain exceptions) at the same initial conversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000\nprincipal amount of Notes if the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for 30\nconsecutive trading days, on the immediately succeeding\n50\ntrading day after the last trading day of such 30 day period. The Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default and\nfundamental change.\nJanuary 2024 Common Stock Offering\nOn January 23, 2024, we issued 32,258,064 shares of Class A Common Stock in a public offering and received proceeds of $93.6 million, net of\nunderwriting commissions of $6.0 million and transaction costs of $0.4 million. We provided a 30-day option to the underwriting agent to purchase\nup to an additional 4,838,709 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Option Shares”) from us on the same terms and conditions. On January 25,\n2024, the Option Shares were exercised in full. The offering of the Option Shares closed on January 29, 2024 for proceeds of $14.1 million, net of\nunderwriting commissions of $0.9 million. Proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock under the January 2024 Common Stock Offering\nwere and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.\nCash Flows\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 88,097 $ 239,256\nCash used in operating activities $ (148,942) $ (156,464)\nCash used in investing activities (118,807) (31,352)\nCash provided by financing activities 116,732 102,340\nOperating activities\nCash used in operating activities was $148.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to cash used in operating activities of\n$156.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $7.5 million decrease in cash used in operating activities was attributable to a decrease of\n$38.1 million in working capital offset by an increase of $30.6 million in expenses to support expanded operations during the year ended December\n31, 2023.\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities was $118.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $31.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $87.5 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a $61.5\nmillion increase in purchases of property and equipment, including procurement of BB satellite materials and advance launch payments, and $26.0\nmillion proceeds from sale of Nano, net of cash deconsolidated and transaction costs, in September 2022.\nFinancing activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $116.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to cash provided by financing\nactivities of $102.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $14.4 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily\nattributable to $53.4 million of net proceeds from borrowings on the Atlas Credit Agreement and Lone Star Loan Agreement, partially offset by\n$39.0 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of Class A Common Stock under the secondary public offerings, ATM Equity Program and\nEquity Line of Credit.\nImpact of inflation\nWhile inflation may impact our capital and operating expenditures, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition have not been significant. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial condition will not be\nmaterially impacted by inflation in the future, including by heightened levels of inflation experienced globally as a consequence of the rapidly\nchanging market and economic conditions.\n51\nFunding Requirements\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, funds raised in January 2024 and access to the Equity Line of Credit\nand ATM Equity Program will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months from the date hereof. However, our\nforecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward-looking statement that\ninvolves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong,\nand we could expend capital resources sooner than we expect.\nFuture capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n• Establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and\nquality, products and services to support our satellite development;\n• Technological or manufacturing and assembling difficulties, design issues or other unforeseen matters;\n• Negotiation of launch agreements (including launch costs), launch delays or failures, deployment failures, or in-orbit satellite failures;\n• Seeking and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n• Timing of the launch of our satellites and subsequent initiation of service in various markets, delays in which will result in increased\noperating expenses;\n• Addressing any competing technological and market developments;\n• Ability to adjust our expenditures and contractual commitments based on capital availability;\n• Ability to operate under the covenants in our debt agreements; and\n• Attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance cash needs through a\ncombination of equity offerings, debt financings, commercial and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through\nthe sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of stockholders will be, or could be, diluted, and the terms of these securities\nmay include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if\navailable, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt,\nmaking capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through commercial agreements, or other similar arrangements with third\nparties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies and/or future revenue streams, or grant licenses on terms that may not be\nfavorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. Also, our ability to raise necessary financing could be impacted by recent\ngeopolitical events, higher interest rates and inflationary economic conditions and their effects on the market conditions. If we are unable to raise\nadditional funds through equity offerings, debt financings or commercial arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or\nterminate our commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market other services even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and\nmarket these services ourselves, or potentially discontinue operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.\nGAAP). Preparation of the financial statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported\namount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment,\nestimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use\nof different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting\npolicies are described in Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nReport. Our critical accounting policies are described below.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe design and self-construct the BB satellites intended to be used to provide SpaceMobile Service to customers. The BB satellites are not intended\nto be held for sale in the ordinary course of business. The costs incurred to complete the design is expensed as incurred. The cost incurred to\ncomplete the construction is capitalized as property and equipment. The cost of self-constructed BB satellite assets consists of direct materials, direct\nlabor, launch costs and other direct costs attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition and desired location for the intended use. Costs\nincurred, including direct materials purchased and launch\n52\npayments made, until the completion of the construction and launch of the BB satellites, are reported as satellite materials, satellites under\nconstruction, and advance launch payments within construction-in-progress. Once launched in orbit, the costs of the BB satellites are reported as\nsatellites in orbit and depreciation of the satellites commences once the BB satellites are ready for their intended use.\nWe capitalize the costs of the test satellites if there is an alternative future use for the test satellites. We capitalize only those expenditures and\nancillary costs that are directly attributable to assembly and testing and necessarily incurred to place the test satellites into their intended location\nand use. These costs include materials costs, launch cost, and other non-recurring costs directly associated with the development of the test satellites.\nThe other non-recurring costs primarily include third-party vendors who are hired solely for the design, assembly, and testing of the test satellite and\nare responsible for the value and progression of the project. The costs for internal, recurrent engineering employees and consultants are expensed as\nengineering services costs and not capitalized to the cost of the test satellites, as these employees are not directly associated with the development of\nthe test satellites.\nWarrant Liabilities\nWe account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and\napplicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC\n815”). Our assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they meet the definition\nof a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether\nthe warrants are indexed to our own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a\ncircumstance outside of our control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional\njudgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period-end date while the warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, they are recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at\nthe time of issuance. Issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification are recorded at their initial fair value on the\ndate of issuance and subject to remeasurement each balance sheet date with changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants to be recognized as\nan unrealized gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nFactors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future\noperating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2023.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required\nunder this Item.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe full text of the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, begins on page 78 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\n53\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports\nthat we file or furnish under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. We periodically review the design and effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures worldwide, including compliance with various laws and regulations that apply to our operations. We make modifications to\nimprove the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, and may take other corrective action, if our reviews identify a need\nfor such modifications or actions. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.\nWe have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and\nour principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-\n15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the year ended December 31, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer\nand our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework\nset forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework). Based on our evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,\n2023.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to the rules\nestablished by the SEC as we are a smaller reporting company.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information\n(b) In the quarter ended December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or\nterminated a plan for the purchase or sale of our securities intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or a non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement for the purchase or sale of our securities, within the meaning of Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\n54\nPart III\nItem 10.

During 2023, none of our NEOs\nreceived any bonuses.\nLong-Term Equity Incentive Compensation. The goal of our long-term, equity based incentive awards is to align the interests of our executives with\nthe interests of stockholders. Because vesting is generally based on continued service, in addition to performance-based vesting in certain cases,\nequity-based incentives also foster the retention of our executives during the award vesting period.\nEquity Compensation Plans\nAST LLC 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. Prior to the Business Combination, equity-based incentive awards in the form of options were issued under\nthe AST LLC 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“AST LLC Incentive Plan”) as incentives to our employees, non-employees, and non-employee members\nof our Board of Directors. Following the Business Combination, no further grants were made under the AST LLC Incentive Plan. However, the AST\nLLC Incentive Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted under it.\nSpaceMobile 2020 Incentive Award Plan. In connection with the Business Combination, we adopted the 2020 Incentive Award Plan (the “2020\nPlan”). Awards may be made under the 2020 Plan covering an aggregate number of Class A Common Stock shares equal to 10,800,000 shares of\nClass A Common Stock. Any shares distributed pursuant to an award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued common stock,\ntreasury common stock or common stock purchased on the open market. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock,\ndividend equivalents, restricted stock units, incentive unit awards, stock appreciation rights, and other stock or cash-based awards. Each incentive\nunit issued pursuant to an award, if any, shall count as one share for purposes of calculating the aggregate number of shares available for issuance\nunder the 2020 Plan.\nTwo types of equity awards have been granted under the 2020 Plan: (1) service-based options and (2) service-based and performance-based\nrestricted stock units. Service-based options typically vest over a four year service period with 25% of the award vesting on the first anniversary of\nthe employee’s commencement date, and the balance thereafter in 36 equal monthly installments. Service-based restricted stock units typically vest\nover a four year service period with 25% of the award vesting on each anniversary of the employee’s vesting commencement date. Performance-\nbased restricted stock units typically vest when the specified performance conditions are met. Options typically expire no later than 10 years from\nthe date of grant.\nNEO Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation in 2023. In May 2022, pursuant to the terms of Mr. Wallace’s employment agreement, the\nCompany's Board of Directors approved an award of 700,000 RSUs to Mr. Wallace, with 400,000 of the RSUs subject to service-based vesting and\n300,000 RSUs subject to performance-based vesting. The service-based RSUs vest over a four year service period with 25% of the awards vesting\non each anniversary of Mr. Wallace's vesting commencement date. The performance-based RSUs will vest upon satisfaction of two specified capital\nraising performance conditions. During 2023, none of our NEOs received any long-term incentive awards under our 2020 Plan.\nOther Elements of Compensation\nIn 2022, pursuant to the terms of Mr. Wallace's employment agreement he received $75,000 as reimbursement of direct out-of-pocket costs relating\nto his relocation to the Miami, Florida area where our corporate office is situated, and received $13,575 as reimbursement of legal fees associated\nwith the negotiation and execution of his employment agreement. Mr. Wallace's employment agreement also provided for reimbursement of certain\ntemporary housing expenses, although no such expenses were incurred or reimbursed.\n401(k) Plan. We currently maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan for our United States based employees, including our NEOs, who satisfy\ncertain eligibility requirements. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan on the same terms as other full-time employees. The Plan\nallows eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation, within prescribed limits, on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the 401(k)\nplan.

Currently, Vodafone’s designee is Luke Ibbetson, Head of Group Research &\nDevelopment, Vodafone.\nWe entered into a side letter with Vodafone dated December 15, 2020, under which we agreed (i) not to enter into any material corporate strategic\nrelationship or material commercial agreement with a party other than Vodafone and its affiliates that would be reasonably expected to materially\nfrustrate our ability to satisfy the obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements with certain exceptions; (ii) to allocate sufficient funds in\nthe capital budget to facilitate compliance with the obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements; and (iii) not to alter the business plan\nin a manner that is materially detrimental to our ability to satisfy the obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements.\nOn January 16, 2024, we entered into a Convertible Security Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Vodafone. Pursuant to the\nInvestment Agreement, Vodafone agreed to purchase our subordinated convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million. In\nconnection with the Investment Agreement, Vodafone Group Services Limited (“Vodafone Group Services”) have entered into letter agreements\nwith AST LLC and us. The letter agreement between Vodafone Group Services and us provides, among other things, for an initial revenue\ncommitment of $25.0 million to us to be paid by Vodafone Group Services over a two and a half year period to be defined in a future definitive\nagreement for us to provide connectivity services. Also, Vodafone submitted a purchase order for network equipment from us to support planned\ncommercial service.\nAmerican Tower\nWe and American Tower have entered into a side letter agreement that was subsequently amended and restated on December 15, 2020 to reflect the\ntransactions and agreements contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement between us and NPA (the “Amended and Restated Letter\nAgreement”). The Amended and Restated Letter Agreement contemplates that us and American Tower will enter into commercial agreements to use\nAmerican Tower facilities for the terrestrial gateway facilities in certain markets. The term of the operational agreement with American Tower is for\nan anticipated five years after the initial launch of commercial mobile services by us.\nOn March 22, 2022, we and American Tower entered into a non-binding term sheet reflecting the terms and conditions for the deployment of our\ngateway satellite technology equipment on property owned and operated by American Tower. Under the agreement, American Tower will provide us\nleased space and managed services at its current and future tower sites and data centers under the global master lease agreement to be entered into\nby the parties.\n72\nThe usage of any American Tower services in a Vodafone market will be memorialized in a commercial agreement among all three parties. In\nmarkets where Vodafone does not operate (“Carrier Neutral Markets”), us and American Tower may enter into an agreement for American Tower to\nmanage the operation of our deployed gateway facility in such market. In Carrier Neutral Markets where we require a third party to provide a\ngateway facility or services, we agree to not accept any bid that is inferior to American Tower’s best and final proposal for such gateway facility or\nservices. We also agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to utilize American Tower facilities in (i) Vodafone markets where Vodafone decides\nto not use its facilities, (ii) in Carrier Neutral Markets, and (iii) instances where we require a third-party vendor.\nAdditionally, we will work with American Tower to evaluate and plan gateway facility and radio access network data center deployments with\npreferred vendor status to offer carrier-neutral hosting facilities in certain equatorial markets. American Tower will serve as the preferred vendor for\ncarrier neutral hosting facilities. We will pay American Tower a monthly connection fee for use of a carrier neutral hosting facility, which we expect\nwill be charged back to each applicable MNO. If us and American Tower agree to construct a new carrier neutral hosting facility or improve an\nexisting one and American Tower elects to fund all such capital expenditures, American Tower will provide us with a fair-market, long-term lease to\nsuch facility. No payments have been made to date between us and American Tower under the Amended and Restated Letter Agreement. American\nTower has the right to designate one individual to our Board of Directors. Currently, American Tower's designee is Ed Knapp, Chief Technology\nOfficer, American Tower.\nRakuten\nOn February 4, 2020, we entered into a commercial agreement with Rakuten for the development of exclusive network capabilities in Japan\ncompatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates, which agreement was amended and restated as of December 15, 2020 (the\n“Rakuten Agreement”). Under the terms of the Rakuten Agreement, we agreed to make investments in building network capabilities in Japan that\nare compatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates. Furthermore, we will collaborate with Rakuten to ensure network capability\nwith Rakuten’s licensed frequencies, including full coverage in Japan with 3GPP Band 3 frequencies with multiple input multiple output (“MIMO”)\ncapability. Upon the launch of such coverage, Rakuten will receive unlimited, exclusive rights and usage capacity in Japan in exchange for a $0.5\nmillion annual maintenance fee payable to AST LLC or our successors. Furthermore, we will make $5.0 million (or such lesser amount as mutually\nagreed upon the parties) in capital investments towards the design, assembly, acquisition and implementation of ground communication assets. Us\nand Rakuten will receive unlimited rights and usage of the ground assets for their respective operations, including, but not limited to, satellite and\nother telecommunication communications. The term of the Rakuten Agreement shall remain in effect until we fulfill obligations under the Rakuten\nAgreement. Rakuten has the right to designate two individuals to our Board of Directors. Currently, Rakuten has designated Hiroshi Mikitani,\nFounder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rakuten, Inc. as a director and has the right to designate another individual.\nThe Rakuten Agreement includes key performance indicators (“KPIs”) associated with the number of satellites launched, timing and coverage of the\nSpaceMobile Service in Japan in a phased manner that we were obligated to meet by June 2023. In connection with our inability to meet the\napplicable KPIs stated in the Rakuten Agreement by the deadline, we recognized an expense of $10.0 million recorded in Other (expense) income,\nnet in the first quarter of 2023 and paid the amount in the third quarter of 2023.\nInvesat and Antares Technologies\nOn March 4, 2024, we and Invesat LLC (“Invesat”), which is part of the Cisneros Group of Companies, of which Ms. Adriana Cisneros, a member\nof our Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer, completed a series of transactions (including a Blocker Merger Transaction as defined in\nthe A&R Operating Agreement, the “Transactions”) resulting in the acquisition by Antares of 10,445,200 shares of our Class A Common Stock. As\npart of the Transactions, 9,932,542 shares of our Class B Common Stock and 200,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock previously held by\nInvesat were cancelled.\nAs part of the Transactions, AST SpaceMobile Holdings II, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of us, merged with and into Invesat,\nwith Invesat surviving such merger (the “First Merger”) and, immediately following the First Merger, Invesat merged with and into AST\nSpaceMobile Holdings, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of us (“AST Holdings”), with AST Holdings surviving such merger (the\n“Second Merger”). After giving effect to the Transactions, the separate limited liability company existence of Invesat ceased.\nIn connection with the Transactions, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to take steps necessary to allow for the amendment and/or\nassignment of each of the Stockholders’ Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, within forty-five (45) days after the closings of the\nTransactions, to add an affiliate of Invesat, Antares, and remove Invesat as a party thereto to allow Antares to benefit from all of the rights\npreviously held by Invesat thereunder. In the event that the Registration Rights\n73\nAgreement and the Stockholders’ Agreement are not amended and/or assigned with such forty-five (45)-day period, we agreed to enter into a\nseparate letter agreement with Antares which provides Antares with substantially the same rights as those held by Invesat LLC under each of the\nRegistration Rights Agreement and the Stockholders’ Agreement.\nDirector Independence\nWe are required to comply with the applicable rules of Nasdaq in determining whether a director is independent. Prior to the filing of this report, our\nBoard of Directors undertook a review of the independence of the individuals named above and have determined that each of Adriana Cisneros,\nAlexander Coleman, Ronald Rubin, Richard Sarnoff and Julio A. Torres qualifies as “independent” as defined under the applicable Nasdaq rules and\nthat Messrs. Coleman, Rubin and Torres qualify as independent under Exchange Act Rule 10A-3 specific to audit committee members.\nItem 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services\nKPMG LLP (“KPMG”) served as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company beginning July 2021.

Each year, the independent registered public accounting firm’s retention to audit our financial statements, including\nthe associated fee, is approved by the Audit Committee. Consistent with the policies and procedures of our written charter, all audit and tax services\nset forth above for 2023 were pre-approved by our Audit Committee, which concluded that the provision of such services by KPMG were\ncompatible with the maintenance of the firm's independence. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chairman of the Audit Committee the\nauthority to evaluate and approve engagements on behalf of the Audit Committee in the event that a need arises for pre-approval between regular\nAudit Committee meetings. If the Chairman so approves any such engagements, he will report that approval to the full Audit Committee at the next\nAudit Committee meeting.\n74\nItem 15.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years\nthen ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\u0003\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not\nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain\nan understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Organization and Nature of Operations\nAST SpaceMobile, Inc., collectively with its subsidiaries (”SpaceMobile” or the “Company”) is currently designing and developing the constellation\nof BlueBird (“BB”) satellites in advance of launching its planned space-based Cellular Broadband network distributed through a constellation of Low\nEarth Orbit (“LEO”) satellites. Once deployed and operational, the BB satellites are designed to provide connectivity directly to off-the-shelf and\nunmodified devices at broadband speeds (the “SpaceMobile Service”). At that point, the Company intends to offer the SpaceMobile Service to cellular\nsubscribers and others through wholesale commercial agreements with cellular service providers. The Company is headquartered in Texas where it\noperates 185,000 square feet satellite assembly, integrating and testing (“AIT”) facilities. The Company’s intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio is\ndiverse, containing numerous and various innovations of the direct-to-cell satellite ecosystem from space to Earth. The Company’s IP portfolio\nconsists of 36 patent families worldwide. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has more than 3,350 patent and patent pending claims worldwide,\nof which approximately 1,050 have been officially granted or allowed.\nThe Company launched its BlueWalker 3 (“BW3”) test satellite on September 10, 2022, and announced the completion of the deployment of the\ncommunication phased array antenna of the BW3 test satellite in orbit on November 14, 2022. On April 25, 2023, the Company announced that it had\nsuccessfully completed two-way voice calls directly to standard unmodified smartphones using the BW3 test satellite. On June 21, 2023, the\nCompany announced that it had achieved repeated successful 4G download speeds of above 10 megabits per second (“Mbps”) to standard unmodified\nsmartphones using the BW3 test satellite. On September 19, 2023, the Company announced it had achieved repeated successful two-way voice calls\ndirectly to standard unmodified smartphones using 5G connectivity and successful download speeds of approximately 14 Mbps utilizing 5 megahertz\n(“Mhz”) of low band spectrum via the BW3 test satellite. The Company intends to continue testing capabilities of the BW3 test satellite, including\nfurther testing with cellular service providers and devices.\nOn April 6, 2021, the Company completed a business combination (the “Business Combination”) with AST & Science, LLC (“AST LLC”).\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, the combined company was organized in an “Up-C” structure in which the business is\noperated by AST LLC and its subsidiaries and in which the Company's only direct assets consist of equity interests in AST LLC. As the managing\nmember of AST LLC, the Company has full, exclusive and complete discretion to manage and control the business of AST LLC and to take all action\nit deems necessary, appropriate, advisable, incidental, or convenient to accomplish the purposes of AST LLC. The Company’s Class A Common\nStock and Public Warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “ASTS” and “ASTSW”, respectively.\nThe Company operates from multiple locations that include its corporate headquarters and 185,000 square feet AIT facilities in Texas where the final\nAIT is performed, and engineering and development centers elsewhere in the United States, India, Scotland, Spain, and Israel.\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as\nmodified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and the Company may take advantage of certain exemptions from\nvarious reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to,\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in the Company's periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-\nbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The consolidated\nfinancial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon\nconsolidation. Certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect\non the reported results of operations.\n85\nAs the Company is the sole managing member of AST LLC and has full, exclusive and complete discretion to manage and control the business of\nAST LLC and to take all actions it deems necessary, appropriate, advisable, incidental, or convenient to accomplish the purposes of AST LLC, the\nfinancial statements of AST LLC and its subsidiaries have been prepared on a consolidated basis with the Company.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical\nexperience when available and on other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions reflected in these financial statements include, but are not limited to, useful lives assigned to property and\nequipment, the fair values of warrant liabilities, potential impairment of long-lived assets, and equity-based compensation expense. The Company\nassesses estimates on an ongoing basis; however, actual results could materially differ from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including\nthe continued uncertainty surrounding rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to geopolitical conflicts and macroeconomic conditions\nincluding changes in inflation and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses\nThe financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated from local currency into reporting currency, which is U.S. dollars, using\nthe current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, and the weighted average exchange rate prevailing during the period for\nrevenues and expenses. The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency for each entity and, accordingly,\ntranslation adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity. Realized\nand unrealized gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are reflected\nas other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the\nChief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The\nCompany’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company has determined that it operates in one operating segment, as the CODM reviews\nfinancial information presented on a combined basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial\nperformance.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company’s cash equivalents consist of short-term money market funds. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity\ndate of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash is primarily maintained at Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)\ninsured financial institutions. The Company maintains its cash in accounts at financial institutions that the Company believes are of high credit quality.\nAt times, the cash balance may exceed federally insured limits. The Company's foreign subsidiaries may deposit cash at institutions that are not\ninsured by the FDIC. Interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are reported under interest income (expense), net in the\nconsolidated statement of operations. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2023 are subject to minimal credit risk.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash represents cash held in escrow and deposit accounts. These funds are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of the\ncontractual agreements.\n86\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of self-constructed BB satellite assets consists of direct materials,\ndirect labor, launch costs, and other direct costs attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition and desired location for the intended use.\nCosts incurred, including direct materials purchased and launch payments made, until the completion of the construction and launch of the BB\nsatellites are reported as satellite materials, satellites under construction, and advance launch payments within construction-in-progress. Once\nlaunched in orbit, the costs of the BB satellites are reported as satellites in orbit and depreciation of the satellites commences once the BB satellites are\nready for their intended use.\nThe Company capitalizes the costs of the test satellites if there is an alternative future use for the test satellites. The Company capitalizes only those\nexpenditures and ancillary costs that are directly attributable to assembly and testing and necessarily incurred to place the test satellites into their\nintended location and use. These costs include materials costs, launch cost, and other non-recurring costs directly associated with the development of\nthe test satellites. The other non-recurring costs primarily include third-party vendors who are hired solely for the design, assembly, and testing of the\ntest satellite and are responsible for the value and progression of the project. The costs for internal, recurrent engineering employees and consultants\nare expensed as engineering services costs and not capitalized to the cost of the test satellites, as these employees are not directly associated with the\ndevelopment of the test satellites. To date, the Company has capitalized one test satellite, BW3, which is reported as part of satellites in orbit within\nproperty and equipment.\nThe Company capitalizes the costs of software obtained for internal use in accordance with the guidance for accounting for costs of computer software\nobtained for internal use. Capitalization of software obtained for internal use commences during the development phase of the project and ends when\nthe asset is ready for its intended use. Software obtained for internal use is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life\nand included within property and equipment on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Capitalized costs of software obtained for internal use for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 were $7.0 million, all of which was developed by third parties to the Company. No such costs were incurred in\n2022.\nThe Company records depreciation in a manner that recognizes the cost of its depreciable assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight-\nline method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the terms of the underlying leases or the estimated useful lives of the\nimprovements. Repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life or enhance the productive capacity of an asset are expensed as\nincurred. Upon retirement or disposal of property and equipment, the Company derecognizes the cost and accumulated depreciation balance\nassociated with the asset, with a resulting gain or loss from disposal included in the determination of net income or loss.\nThe Company depreciates the assets over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nBuildings 30 years\nComputers, software, and equipment 2 to 10 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nSatellite antennas 5 years\nSatellites in orbit 2 to 7 years\nLab, assembly, and integration equipment 5 to 10 years\nOthers (1) 5 to 7 years\n(1) Includes vehicles, furniture and fixtures, and a phased array test facility.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets. Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever\nevents or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. The Company continually\nevaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long-lived assets may warrant\nrevision or if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired. To compute whether assets have been impaired,\nthe estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value. To the extent that\nthe future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset. There were no impairment\ncharges for long-lived assets recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n87\nWarrant Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific\nterms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”), and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging\n(“ASC 815”). Management’s assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they\nmeet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815,\nincluding whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash\nsettlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the\nuse of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period-end date while the warrants are\noutstanding.\nIssued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification are recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of\nissuance. Issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification are recorded as a liability at their initial fair value on the\ndate of issuance and subject to remeasurement each balance sheet date with changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants to be recognized as an\nunrealized gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. The fair\nvalue of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not necessarily representative of the amount that could be realized or settled, nor does the fair\nvalue amount consider the tax consequences of realization or settlement. In assessing the fair value of financial instruments, the Company uses a\nvariety of methods and assumptions, which are based on estimates of market conditions and risks existing at the time.\nThe Company uses the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for its assets and liabilities:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or\nliabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable\nsuch as interest rate and yield curves, and market-corroborated inputs.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on the Company's assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset\nor liability.\nRevenue Recognition\nTo date, the Company has not generated any revenues from its SpaceMobile Service. The Company's former subsidiary, NanoAvionika UAB\n(“Nano”), generated revenue from the development and manufacture of satellite technology, and ancillary sales and services globally. Nano also sold\nindividual satellite parts, subsystems, and software to be configured to customers’ satellites, and entered into “rideshare” type agreements whereby\nNano provided hosted payload services using customers’ payloads integrated with Nano-owned satellite buses for scheduled launches. Accordingly,\nall revenue presented herein for the year ended December 31, 2022 exclusively related to Nano’s sales of goods and services until the completion of\nthe sale of Nano on September 6, 2022.\nRevenue generated from Nano's sales of goods and services was recognized in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n(“ASC 606”), and as such, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. Revenue for services provided was\nrecognized over time based on an output method, under which the total value of revenue was recognized based on each contract’s deliverable(s) as\nthey were completed and when value was transferred to a customer. Certain of the performance obligations did not meet the criteria for over time\nrecognition such as satellite hardware and subsystems. In these scenarios, revenue was recognized upon transfer of control of the performance\nobligation to the customer. Revenue was deferred in the event all the performance obligations were not satisfied for which compensation was received.\nRevenue associated with unsatisfied performance obligations were contract liabilities, which were recorded within accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Upon the sale of Nano on September 6, 2022, there were no deferred revenues related to Nano’s sale of\ngoods and services recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\n88\nCosts to obtain Nano’s sales contracts were capitalized and amortized in accordance with the pattern of transfer of the underlying goods or services,\nand typically included commissions paid to external parties or distributors. Sales commissions were considered incremental costs in obtaining a new\nsales contract and thus were capitalized. Costs to fulfill Nano’s sales contracts, such as overhead costs and third-party costs to manufacture, did not\nmeet the specified capitalization criteria (i.e., did not generate or enhance Nano’s resources) and as such were expensed as incurred. Costs to obtain\nand fulfill Nano’s sales contracts were immaterial.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales included the purchase price of various products used and services performed to execute Nano’s sales contracts. Cost of sales also\nincludes operational costs to fulfil Nano customer orders, including costs for Nano employees and overhead until the completion of the sale of Nano\non September 6, 2022.\nEngineering Services Costs\nEngineering services costs are charged to expense as incurred. Engineering services costs consist primarily of the cost of employees and consultants\ninvolved in the design and development of the BB satellites, managing the network and satellite operations centers, and indirect costs related to the\nassembly, integration and testing of the BB satellites, license cost, and general expenses related to AIT facilities and engineering development centers.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist principally of development activities in\nwhich the Company typically engages third-party vendors for the design and development of the electronic componentry, software, and mechanical\ndeployment systems and materials and supplies consumed in the development activities. Costs for certain research and development activities are\nrecognized based on the completion of milestones that trigger payments.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for equity awards, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation –\nStock Compensation (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires all equity-based payments to employees, which includes grants of employee equity awards, to\nbe recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. The Company issues stock-based compensation\nawards to the employees, non-employees, and non-employee directors of its subsidiaries. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation for\nawards granted to non-employees in a similar fashion to the way it accounts for stock-based compensation awards to employees.\nThe Company estimates the grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees, non-employees, and non-employee members of the Board of\nDirectors using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of the Black-Scholes model requires the Company to make assumptions with respect to\nthe expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates\nand expected dividend yields of the common stock. The fair value of restricted stock units granted to employees, non-employees and non-employee\nmembers of the Board of Directors is based on the fair value of the Company’s stock on the grant date. For awards that vest based solely on\nachievement of a service condition, the Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which the award holder provides\nsuch services. For awards that vest based on both service and performance conditions, the Company recognizes expense using a graded method for\nsuch awards only to the extent it believes achievement of the performance conditions are probable. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur\nand reverses any previously recognized compensation cost associated with forfeited awards. The Company accounts for the compensation associated\nwith equity awards by offsetting expense with additional paid-in capital.\nThe Company’s less than wholly owned subsidiary, AST LLC, has issued stock-based compensation awards to its employees, non-employees, and\nnon-employee directors. The exercise of these awards decreases the Company’s ownership interest in AST LLC. The Company accounts for the\ncompensation associated with these awards similarly to the awards described above; however, the offset to the expense is recorded to noncontrolling\ninterest rather than additional paid-in capital.\n89\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts\nof existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to\napply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and\nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred\ntax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the\nperiods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected\nfuture taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be\ntaken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) to be\nsustained upon examination by taxing authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than 50%\nlikelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as\nincome tax expense. There were no uncertain tax positions and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The\nCompany is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe noncontrolling interests primarily represent the equity interest in AST LLC held by members other than the Company. Changes in the Company’s\nownership interest in AST LLC while retaining control of AST LLC are accounted for as equity transactions. Income or loss is attributed to the\nnoncontrolling interests based on their contractual distribution rights, and the relative percentages of equity interest held by the Company and the\nother members during the period.\nNet Loss per Share\nThe Company reports both basic and diluted net loss per share. Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares\nof common stock outstanding and excludes the dilutive effect of warrants, stock options, and other types of convertible securities. Diluted net loss per\nshare is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the dilutive effect of stock options, warrants\nand other types of convertible securities are included in the calculation. Dilutive securities are excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation\nin periods where the Company reports a net loss as such dilutive securities have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn July 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-03, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive\nIncome (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718),\nwhich amends or supersedes various SEC paragraphs within the codification to conform to past announcements and guidance issued by the SEC. The\namendments in this ASU reflect alignment to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120 (\"SAB 120\") that was issued by the SEC in November 2021. SAB\n120 provides guidance to entities issuing share-based awards shortly before announcing material, nonpublic information. The guidance indicates that\nentities should consider such material nonpublic information to adjust the observable market if the effect of the release of the material nonpublic\ninformation is expected to affect the share price and the share-based awards are non-routine in nature. This ASU was effective immediately, and the\nadoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nFuture Adoption of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, that requires a\npublic entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all\ndisclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. It requires a public entity to also disclose the title\nand position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The ASU is effective for the Company on January 1, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal\nyears beginning January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to all prior\nperiods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n90\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 requires a\npublic business entity (PBE) to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into\nspecified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold.\nIn addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by\njurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. The ASU is effective for the Company on January 1,\n2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAll other new accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective or adopted, have been deemed to be not relevant to the Company and,\naccordingly, are not expected to have a material impact once adopted.\n3. Fair Value Measurement\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents $ 69,661 $ - $ -\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 69,661 $ - $ -\nLiabilities:\nPublic warrant liability $ 18,707 $ - $ -\nPrivate placement warrant liability - 11,253 -\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 18,707 $ 11,253 $ -\nAs of December 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents $ 230,651 $ - $ -\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 230,651 $ - $ -\nLiabilities:\nPublic warrant liability $ 22,864 $ - $ -\nPrivate placement warrant liability - 16,082 -\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 22,864 $ 16,082 $ -\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, the Company had $88.1 million and $239.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash, of which $69.7 million and $230.7 million, respectively, is classified as cash equivalents, which consists principally of short-term\nmoney market funds with original maturities of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2023, restricted cash of $2.5 million represents a deposit into an\ninterest reserve escrow account in accordance with the requirements under the Atlas Credit Agreement defined in Note 8: Debt, and a deposit against\nthe bank guaranty issued to the landlord for lease of a property. As of December 31, 2022, restricted cash of $0.7 million represented deposits against\nthe bank guaranty issued to the landlord for lease of a property. For certain instruments, including cash, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, it\nwas estimated that the carrying amount approximated fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments.\nWarrant liabilities are comprised of both publicly issued warrants (“Public Warrants”) and private placement warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”),\nexercisable for shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company. Warrant liabilities are documented in detail at Note 9: Warrant Liabilities. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Public Warrants are classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active\nmarket under the ticker “ASTSW”.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes-Merton Model. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Private\nPlacement Warrants are classified as Level 2 as the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone outside of a small group of individuals who are\npermitted transferees would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants. For this reason, the\nCompany determined that the volatility of each Private Placement Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant.\n91\nThe Company’s Black-Scholes-Merton model to value Private Placement Warrants required the use of the following subjective assumption inputs:\n• The risk-free interest rate assumption was initially based on a weighted average of the three- and five-year U.S. Treasury rate, which was\ncommensurate with the contractual term of the Warrants, which expire on the earlier of (i) five years after the completion of the initial business\ncombination and (ii) upon redemption or liquidation. As of December 31, 2023, the risk-free rate assumption was based on the two-and three-\nyear U.S. Treasury rates as the estimated time to expiration was 2.26 years (compared to an estimated time to expiration of 3.26 years as of\nDecember 31, 2022). An increase in the risk-free interest rate, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the\nwarrant liabilities and vice versa.\n• The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility of the Company’s Public Warrants, which as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022 was 80.4% and 109.6%, respectively.\n4. Other Assets\nOther current assets consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nAdvances to suppliers $ 12,793 $ 22,947\nVAT receivable 1,152 1,673\nOthers 249 334\nTotal other current assets $ 14,194 $ 24,954\n5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nLand $ 1,350 $ 1,350\nBuildings 14,555 10,268\nLeasehold improvements 9,111 8,197\nSatellite in orbit(1) 92,464 -\nLab, assembly, and integration equipment 31,957 13,657\nSatellite antenna 7,188 5,142\nComputer hardware and software 11,112 3,153\nOther 1,230 1,707\nConstruction in progress\nBlueWalker 3 test satellite(1) - 92,077\nSatellite materials, satellites under construction, and advance launch payments(2) 125,428 10,721\nOther 5,256 6,696\nTotal property and equipment, gross $ 299,651 $ 152,968\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization $ (61,173) (6,979)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 238,478 $ 145,989\n(1) BlueWalker 3 test satellite was determined to be ready for its intended use on April 25, 2023 and was reclassified from Construction in progress to Satellite in orbit as of that\ndate and depreciated over its expected remaining useful life of approximately 16 months.\n(2) Advance launch payments, which were included in other non-current assets as of December 31, 2022, were reclassified to property and equipment as of June 30, 2023.\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $54.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively.\n92\n6. Leases\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are lessees under various operating leases for certain office space, manufacturing facilities and equipment. The\nCompany’s leases have established fixed payment terms which are subject to annual rent increases throughout the term of each lease agreement. The\nCompany’s lease agreements have varying non-cancellable rental periods which include options for the Company to extend portions of its lease terms\nand have similar terms in which they may terminate the lease prior to the end date but must provide advanced notice.\nThe Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities associated with lease agreements with an initial term of 12 months or greater, while\nlease agreements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. When reasonably certain\nthat renewal options will be exercised, the Company includes lease payments associated with such options, including those that are exercisable at its\ndiscretion, in the measurement of its operating leases assets and liabilities. Where implicit rates are not included in the lease agreement, the Company\ndetermines the incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement date based on various factors, including the lowest grade of debt available in the\nmarketplace for the same term as the associated lease.\nMidland Lease\nOn November 13, 2018, AST LLC entered into both an Economic Development Agreement (the “EDA”) and a sublease agreement with Midland\nDevelopment Corporation. The premise of the EDA was to create jobs in the Midland, Texas area, as well as to have AST LLC improve the land,\noffice and hangar spaces at the leased facility located at the Midland International Air & Space Port in Midland, Texas. The term of the lease\ncommenced on November 21, 2018 and extends through November 20, 2033. Pursuant to the agreement, the base rental payments for the first five\nyears were abated, as the Company prepaid the rent in each period and achieved an increasing level of financial commitments, measured annually on\nMarch 31st of each of the first five years of the lease. These commitments include 1) the total number of full-time jobs and the related annual payroll\ncosts and 2) cumulative capital investments in personal property and improvements to the existing land/structures. The Company recognized the lease\nreimbursements as an offset to rent expense for the related reimbursable month. In addition, the Company qualified for an additional five years (years\nsix through ten of the term) of abatements which were contingent upon the Company achieving its commitments through the first five years of the\nlease and maintaining or exceeding those year five commitment levels in years six through year ten of the term.\nThe table below sets forth information regarding the Company’s lease agreements with an initial term of greater than 12 months (dollars in\nthousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net $ 13,221 $ 7,671\nOperating lease liabilities $ 13,368 $ 7,768\nWeighted-average lease term (in years) 8.4 9.3\nWeighted-average discount rate 13.2% 13.1%\nThe Company generally recognizes lease costs associated with its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The table below sets\nforth information regarding the Company's lease costs, which are included as general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated\nstatements of operations for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nShort-term operating lease expense $ 2,159 $ 1,191\nOperating lease expense 2,046 939\nTotal lease expense $ 4,205 $ 2,130\n93\nAs of December 31, 2023, the maturities of the Company’s operating lease liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 3,078\n2025 2,909\n2026 2,541\n2027 2,326\n2028 2,269\nThereafter 8,867\nTotal lease payments 21,990\nLess effects of discounting (8,622)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 13,368\nIncluded in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows under operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $2.0\nmillion and $0.8 million, respectively, of cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities.\n7. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nSalaries, wages and benefits $ 2,338 $ 2,357\nResearch and development 5,644 3,855\nProperty and equipment 8,807 1,796\nOther professional services 2,429 1,819\nDeferred other income 2,246 2,499\nOthers 2,462 577\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 23,926 $ 12,903\n8. Debt\nLong-term debt consists of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nSenior secured credit facility(1) $ 52,023 $ -\nCapital equipment loan 15,000 -\nTerm loan 4,758 5,000\nTotal debt 71,781 5,000\nLess: current portion of long-term debt (252) (242)\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs(1) (12,277) -\nLong-term debt, net of issuance costs $ 59,252 $ 4,758\n(1) Includes estimated exit fee of $3.5 million due at maturity.\nThe aggregate future contractual maturities of long-term debt were as follows as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nYear As of December 31, 2023\n2024 $ 252\n2025 2,920\n2026 55,125\n2027 2,466\n2028 5,363\nThereafter 5,655\nTotal principal $ 71,781\n94\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the aggregate fair value of the Company’s debt was $68.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively.\nThe fair value of the debt has been determined under the discounted cash flow method using significant inputs derived from, or corroborated by,\nobservable market data (Level 2 inputs).\nDebt discount and issuance costs are comprised of costs incurred in connection with debt issuance and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets\nas a deduction to the carrying amount of the associated debt and amortized using the effective interest method to interest expense over the term of the\ndebt. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $4.5 million and $0.2 million of interest expense related to the\ndebt noted above, respectively. The interest expense included amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023. Interest expense is included in interest income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants requirements.\nSenior secured credit facility\nOn August 14, 2023, AST LLC entered into a senior secured term loan credit agreement with ACP Post Oak Credit II LLC as administrative agent\nand collateral agent and Atlas Credit Partners, LLC (“Atlas”) as lender, providing for a principal loan commitment of up to $100.0 million (the “Atlas\nCredit Agreement”), of which $48.5 million was borrowed upon closing (“Senior secured credit facility loan”). In addition, a two-year collateral\nprotection insurance policy was issued to the lenders and a cash premium based on a single digit percentage of the amount drawn was paid to the\ninsurance provider thereunder (the “Cash Premium”). An additional amount of up to $51.5 million may be borrowed only to the extent the Company\nraises additional capital through equity raises and obtains an additional collateral protection insurance policy such that the Company has insurance\ncoverage equal to at least the amount of borrowings under the facility.\nThe initial borrowing of $48.5 million accrues interest at a fixed rate equal to the three-month secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) as of the\nclosing date plus 9.625% per annum equal to 14.75% (the “Atlas Fixed Rate”) payable on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. The borrowing\namounts are payable at maturity on August 14, 2026 and are subject to mandatory prepayments upon the occurrence of certain specified events.\nUpon closing, the Company received proceeds of $37.2 million, net of debt issuance costs of $9.5 million and deposit of $1.8 million into an interest\nreserve escrow account. Debt issuance costs of $9.5 million consist of agent fees, offering expenses, and two years of cash premium. Debt issuance\ncosts also includes an estimated exit fee of $3.5 million equal to $2.8 million plus 1.50% of any undrawn commitments payable upon maturity. Total\ndebt issuance costs are accreted to interest expense over the term of the Atlas Credit Agreement using the effective interest method. The net proceeds\nwere and are expected to continue to be used for general corporate purposes as permitted under the Atlas Credit Agreement.\nBorrowings are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries other than the assets of certain excluded subsidiaries. The\nAtlas Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, requires the Company to maintain certain levels of liquidity, limits\nthe Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments (including cash dividends on common stock), and sell or otherwise\ndispose of its assets, among other restrictions.\nThe Company has the option to prepay all or part of the outstanding principal balance of the Senior secured credit facility loan. Any repayment of\nprincipal prior to the eighteenth-month anniversary of closing will be subject to a call premium equal to the present value of all interest payments due\nthrough the eighteenth-month anniversary, calculated using a discount rate equal to the applicable treasury rate as of the repayment date plus 50 basis\npoints.\nThe amount borrowed and outstanding shall be mandatorily repaid in the case of certain events as specified in the Atlas Credit Agreement.\nSpecifically, in the event of a Change in Control, Atlas has the right to immediately redeem all outstanding borrowings at a price of 101% of the\noutstanding principal amount plus the call premium and accrued and unpaid cash interest. This mandatory prepayment qualifies as an embedded\nderivative requiring bifurcation. The Company determined the fair value of the mandatory prepayment derivative feature is immaterial.\nCapital equipment loan\nOn August 14, 2023, AST LLC and certain other subsidiaries of the Company entered into a loan agreement with Lone Star State Bank of West Texas\n(“Lone Star”) as lender, providing for $15.0 million principal term loan commitment secured by certain real property fixtures and equipment in one of\nthe Company’s Texas facilities (the “Lone Star Loan Agreement”) of which the entire term loan amount was borrowed on September 19, 2023. The\nLone Star Loan Agreement includes certain customary affirmative and negative covenants. The net proceeds were and are expected to continue to be\nused for general corporate purposes.\n95\nBorrowings accrue interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.75%, subject to a ceiling rate. As of December 31, 2023, the effective interest rate on the\nborrowings is 9.48% per annum. Interest payments are due and payable on a monthly basis. Interest payments began in September 2023 and principal\npayments will begin in April 2025. Principal repayments are thereafter due in 48 equal monthly installments until January 2029, the maturity date of\nthe loan. In connection with the Lone Star Loan Agreement, the Company deposited a cash balance of $15.0 million in the Lone Star Bank Money\nMarket Fund. This cash balance will be converted to restricted cash if the Company fails to maintain a consolidated balance of cash and cash\nequivalents of at least $75.0 million. This restricted cash will be used to offset against the term loan obligations if the Company fails to maintain a\nconsolidated balance of cash and cash equivalents of at least $50.0 million.\nTerm loan\nOn December 8, 2021, the Company’s subsidiary, AST & Science Texas, LLC, executed an agreement to purchase real property, including offices,\nindustrial warehouse buildings and equipment for a total purchase price of $8.0 million. In connection with the purchase, AST & Science Texas, LLC\nentered into an agreement with Lone Star State Bank of West Texas (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) to issue a term promissory note (the “Term\nLoan”) for $5.0 million with a maturity date of December 8, 2028 that is secured by the property.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 4.20% per annum until December 2026, and from December 2026 until\nDecember 2028 at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.20% subject to adjustment if the index rate as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement is\ngreater than 4.20%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears commencing in January 2022. Thereafter, outstanding principal and accrued interest will be\ndue and payable in monthly installments of $40,000, commencing in January 2023 and continuing until November 2028, with the final remaining\nbalance of unpaid principal and interest due and payable in December 2028.\n9. Warrant Liabilities\nWarrant liabilities are comprised of both Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the registered holder to\npurchase one whole share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a holder of Public Warrants\nmay exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock.\nThis means that only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. The Public Warrants expire on April 6, 2026, five years\nafter the Business Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public\nWarrants under the following conditions:\n• In whole and not in part;\n• At a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n• Upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; and\n• If, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days\nwithin a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.\nThe redemption criteria discussed above prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the Public Warrant\nexercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and the Company issues a notice of redemption of the warrants, each Public Warrant holder\nwill be entitled to exercise its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A common stock may fall below the\n$18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) as well as the $11.50\nwarrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis\nand are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by\nsomeone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and\nexercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, 1,200 Public Warrants were exercised at a price of $11.50 per share, resulting in cash proceeds of\napproximately $13,800 and the issuance of 1,200 shares of Class A common stock. In addition, 50,000 Private Placement Warrants were converted to\nPublic Warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2023, no Public Warrants were\n96\nexercised and no Private Placement Warrants were converted to Public Warrants. At December 31, 2023 and 2022 there were 11,547,600 Public\nWarrants and 6,050,000 Private Placement Warrants outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded warrant liabilities of $30.0 million and $38.9 million in the consolidated\nbalance sheets, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized a gain of $9.0 million and $19.1 million,\nrespectively, on the change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations.\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had purchase commitments of approximately $13.5 million, primarily related to procurement of BB satellite\ncomponents, R&D programs, and capital improvements.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully\nadjudicated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a\nmaterial loss in excess of any recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.\nTherefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against\nthe Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that\nreporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nDelaware Class Action Litigations\nFollowing books and records demands pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220, two stockholders have filed putative class action complaints in the Delaware Court\nof Chancery against the Company, certain current and former directors of the Company and its predecessor entity and manager, New Providence\nAcquisition Corp. and New Providence Management LLC, and Abel Avellan, alleging claims of breach of fiduciary duties and aiding and abetting\nsuch breaches, relating to the de-SPAC merger. The first of those complaints, Taylor v. Coleman, et al. (C.A. No. 2023-1292), was filed on December\n27, 2023, and the second, Drulias v. New Providence Management LLC, et al., was filed on March 29, 2024 (collectively, the “Delaware Stockholder\nClass Actions”). Both complaints seek equitable relief and unspecified monetary damages. On March 15, 2024, prior to the filing of the Drulias\naction, Defendants had moved to dismiss the Taylor action. No schedule has been set for either of the Delaware Stockholder Class Actions.\n11. Stockholders’ Equity\nClass A Common Stock\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 90,161,309 shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding. Holders of Class A Common Stock are\nentitled to one vote for each share. The Company is authorized to issue 800,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per\nshare.\nClass B Common Stock\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 50,041,757 shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. Shares of Class B Common Stock were\nissued to then existing equity holders of AST LLC (other than Mr. Abel Avellan, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“Mr.\nAvellan”)) at the time of the Business Combination and are non-economic, but entitle the holder to one vote per share. The Company is authorized to\nissue 200,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nThe existing equity holders (other than Mr. Avellan) at the time of the Business Combination own economic interests in AST LLC which are\nredeemable into either shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or cash at the option of the Company. Upon redemption of the AST\nLLC Common Units by the existing equity holders (other than Mr. Avellan), a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock held by such\nexisting equity holders will be cancelled.\nClass C Common Stock\n97\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 78,163,078 shares of Class C Common Stock issued and outstanding. Shares of Class C Common Stock were\nissued to Mr. Avellan in connection with the Business Combination and are non-economic, but entitle the holder to ten votes per share and the Class C\nShare Voting Amount, the latter of which is a number of votes per share equal to (1) (x) an amount of votes equal to 88.3% of the total voting power\nof the outstanding voting stock, minus (y) the total voting power of the outstanding capital stock (other than Class C Common Stock) owned or\ncontrolled by Mr. Avellan and his permitted transferees, divided by (2) the number of shares of Class C Common Stock then outstanding (the “Super-\nVoting Rights”). The Company is authorized to issue 125,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nMr. Avellan owns economic interests in AST LLC which are redeemable into either shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or cash at\nthe option of the Company. Upon redemption of any AST LLC Common Units held by Mr. Avellan, a corresponding number of shares of Class C\ncommon stock held by Mr. Avellan will be cancelled. Correspondingly, the Super-Voting Rights associated with such shares of Class C common stock\nwill be terminated.\nPreferred Stock\nAt December 31, 2023, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of\npreferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the\nCompany’s Board of Directors.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe noncontrolling interests primarily represent the equity interest in AST LLC held by members other than the Company. Changes in the Company’s\nownership interest in AST LLC while retaining control of AST LLC are accounted for as equity transactions. Income or loss is attributed to the\nnoncontrolling interests based on their contractual distribution rights, and the relative percentages of equity interest held by the Company and the\nother members during the period.\nAs the sole managing member of AST LLC controlling the operating decisions of AST LLC, the Company consolidates the financial position and\nresults of operations of AST LLC and its subsidiaries. The Company reports equity interest in AST LLC held by members other than the Company as\nnoncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling interest is classified as permanent equity within the consolidated\nbalance sheets as the Company may only elect to settle a redemption request in cash if the cash delivered in the exchange is limited to the amount of\nnet proceeds from the issuance and sale of a Class A Common Stock from a new permanent equity offering.\nEach issuance of the Company's Class A Common Stock is accompanied by a corresponding issuance of AST LLC Common Units to the Company,\nwhich results in changes in ownership and reduction in noncontrolling interest. At December 31, 2023, there were 11,547,600 Public Warrants and\n6,050,000 Private Placement Warrants outstanding (see Note 9: Warrant Liabilities for further details), each of which entitles the holder to purchase\none whole share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Each warrant exercise is accompanied by a corresponding issuance of AST\nLLC Common Units to the Company, which will result in a change in ownership and reduce the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and\nincrease additional paid-in capital.\nIn addition, the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of AST LLC permits the noncontrolling interest\nholders of AST LLC Common Units to exchange AST LLC Common Units, together with related shares of the Class B Common Stock or Class C\nCommon Stock, for shares of the Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis or, at the election of the Company, for cash (a “Cash Exchange”). A\nCash Exchange is limited to the amount of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of Class A Common Stock from a new permanent equity offering.\nFuture redemptions or direct exchanges of AST LLC Common Units by the noncontrolling interest holders will result in a change in ownership and\nreduce the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increase additional paid-in capital. Certain members of AST LLC also hold options that are\nsubject to service or performance conditions (see Note 12: Stock-Based Compensation for further details), that are exercisable for AST LLC Common\nUnits. The exercise of the options results in a change in ownership and increases the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and decreases\nadditional paid-in capital.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the noncontrolling interest in AST LLC was approximately 58.7% and 64.2%, respectively. The\ndecrease in noncontrolling interest percentage during the year ended December 31, 2023 was a result of the issuance of Class A Common Stock under\nthe Common Stock Offering and Equity Distribution Agreement, redemption of AST LLC Common Units in exchange for Class A Common Stock\nand the vesting of the Company’s restricted stock units, partially offset by exercise of options to AST LLC Common Units.\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreement\n98\nOn May 6, 2022, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement (collectively referred to as\nthe “Common Stock Purchase Agreement”) with B. Riley Principal Capital, LLC (“B. Riley”). Pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement,\nthe Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to sell to B. Riley up to $75.0 million of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at 97% of\nthe volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Class A common stock calculated in accordance with the Common Stock Purchase Agreement,\nover a period of 24 months subject to certain limitations and conditions contained in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. Sales and timing of any\nsales of Class A common stock are solely at the election of the Company, and the Company is under no obligation to sell any securities to B. Riley\nunder the Common Stock Purchase Agreement.\nUnder the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company had issued 1,756,993 shares of its Class A Common Stock as of December 31, 2022,\nresulting in net proceeds of $13.4 million. The Company did not issue any shares of its Class A Common Stock under the Common Stock Purchase\nAgreement during the year ended December 31, 2023. Proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Class A common stock under the Common Stock\nPurchase Agreement were and are expected to continue to be used for general corporate purposes.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nOn September 8, 2022, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Sales Agreement” or “At The Market Equity Program”)\nwith Evercore Group L.L.C. and B. Riley Securities, Inc. (collectively, the “agents”) to sell shares of the Company’s Class A common stock having an\naggregate sale price of up to $150.0 million through an “at the market offering” program under which the agents act as sales agents. The sales of the\nshares made under the Sales Agreement may be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule\n415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The agents sell the Company’s Class A common stock based upon the Company’s\ninstructions (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions the Company may impose). Under the Sales\nAgreement, the agents are entitled to total compensation at a commission rate of up to 3.0% of the gross sales price per share sold.\nUnder the Sales Agreement, the Company issued 1,527,909 shares of its Class A common stock during the year ended December 31, 2023,\naggregating to proceeds of $7.2 million, net of commissions paid to the agents and transaction costs. The Company had issued 2,697,091 shares of its\nClass A Common Stock as of December 31, 2022, aggregating to proceeds of $20.0 million, net of commissions paid to the agents and transaction\ncosts. Proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement were and are expected to continue to be used for\ngeneral corporate purposes.\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn June 30, 2023, the Company issued 12,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in a public offering and received proceeds of $56.6 million, net\nof transaction costs of $0.3 million. The Company provided a 30-day option to the underwriting agent to purchase up to an additional 1,875,000\nshares to cover over-allotments, if any. The over-allotment option was not exercised. Proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Class A common stock\nunder the Common Stock Offering were and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.\n99\n12. Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation, measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, is typically recognized ratably over the requisite services\nperiod, using the straight-line method of expense attribution. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in the following categories of\nits consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nEngineering services $ 8,832 $ 5,026\nGeneral and administrative costs 4,457 4,365\nBlueWalker 3 satellite - construction in progress(1) - (45)\nTotal $ 13,289 $ 9,346\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2022 stock-based compensation was reversed as a result of forfeiture of options previously provided to a\nsupplier.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of the stock option awards to employees, non-employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors\nusing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected volatility of the\nCompany's stock, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) any expected dividends. Due to the lack of company-\nspecific historical and implied volatility data, the Company based the estimate of expected volatility on the estimated and expected volatilities of a\nrepresentative group of publicly traded companies. For these analyses, the Company selects companies with comparable characteristics including\nenterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-\nbased awards. The Company computes the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the\nequivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient\namount of historical information regarding the volatility of the Company’s stock price becomes available. For awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla”\noptions, the Company estimates the expected life of the employee stock options using the “simplified” method, whereby, the expected life equals the\naverage of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to\nthe contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of\ngrant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the\nCompany has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company elects to account for\nforfeitures as they occur rather than apply an estimated forfeiture rate to stock-based compensation expense.\nThe fair value of restricted stock units granted to employees, non-employees, and non-employee members of the Board of Directors is based on the\nfair value of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The Company elects to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than apply an estimated\nforfeiture rate to stock-based compensation expense.\nAST LLC 2019 Equity Incentive Plan\nPrior to the Business Combination, under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“AST LLC Incentive Plan”), AST LLC was authorized to issue ordinary\nshares, as well as options exercisable for ordinary shares, as incentives to its employees, non-employees, and non-employee members of its Board of\nDirectors. Following the Business Combination, no further grants were made or will be made under the AST LLC Incentive Plan. In connection with\nthe Business Combination, the existing AST LLC options were reclassified into options to acquire AST LLC Incentive Equity Units, and there was no\nincremental compensation cost and the terms of the outstanding awards, including fair value, vesting conditions and classification, were unchanged.\nEach AST LLC Incentive Equity Unit is convertible into one AST LLC Common Unit and each AST LLC Common Unit is redeemable for one share\nof Class A Common Stock on the later of the (i) 24-month anniversary of the consummation of the Business Combination and (ii) six-month\nanniversary from the vesting date. The AST LLC Incentive Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted under\nit, except that in lieu of ordinary shares, holders of options under the AST LLC Incentive Plan have the right to exercise for AST LLC Incentive Units,\nwhich may then be converted into AST LLC Common Units, which may further be converted into shares of the Class A Common Stock.\nThere were two types of options granted under the AST LLC Incentive Plan: (1) service-based options and (2) performance-based options. Service-\nbased options typically vest over a five year service period with 20% of the award vesting on the first anniversary of the employee’s commencement\ndate, and the balance thereafter in 48 equal monthly installments. Certain service-based options\n100\nalso provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control or other performance condition as defined by the AST LLC Incentive Plan\nPerformance-based options typically vest on the earliest date that any of the following occurs: (i) AST LLC effects an initial public offering and\nbecomes a reporting company, (ii) AST LLC experiences a change of control, or (iii) other specified performance conditions. Both service-based and\nperformance-based options typically expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.\nAs of December 31, 2023, AST LLC was authorized to issue a total of 12,812,959 ordinary shares under a reserve set aside for equity awards. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there were 7,770,421 options outstanding under the AST LLC Incentive Plan. Following the Business Combination on April 6,\n2021, no further equity award grants were made under the AST LLC Incentive Plan.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted-Average\nWeighted- Remaining\nAverage Exercise Contractual Term Aggregate\nOptions Price (years) Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 10,767,799 $ 0.83 5.87 $ 42,994,264\nGranted - -\nExercised (2,972,581) 0.08\nCancelled or forfeited (24,797) 3.35\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 7,770,421 $ 1.11 5.76 $ 38,262,071\nOptions exercisable as of December 31, 2023 5,960,866 $ 0.90 5.59 $ 30,552,352\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023 6,391,004 $ 1.24 5.66 $ 30,639,437\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s unvested option activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted-Average Grant\nNumber of Shares Date Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2022 2,645,240 $ 0.80\nGranted - -\nVested (814,415) 0.76\nForfeited (21,270) 2.25\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 1,809,555 $ 0.80\nThe fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. There were no stock options granted\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $17.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested stock options was $1.1 million, which is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted average period of 1.51 years.\nSpaceMobile 2020 Incentive Award Plan\nIn connection with the Business Combination, the Company adopted the 2020 Incentive Award Plan (the “2020 Plan”). Awards may be made under\nthe 2020 Plan covering an aggregate number of Class A Common Stock shares equal to 10,800,000. Any shares distributed pursuant to an award may\nconsist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued common stock, treasury common stock or common stock purchased on the open market. The\n2020 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, restricted stock units, incentive unit awards, stock\nappreciation rights, and other stock or cash-based awards. Each incentive unit issued pursuant to an award, if any, shall count as one share for\npurposes of calculating the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 2020 Plan.\nTwo types of equity awards have been granted under the 2020 Plan: (1) service-based options and (2) service-based and performance-based restricted\nstock units. Service-based options typically vest over a four year service period with 25% of the award vesting on the first anniversary of the\nemployee’s commencement date, and the balance thereafter in 36 equal monthly installments. Service-based restricted stock units typically vest over a\nfour year service period with 25% of the award vesting on each anniversary of the employee’s vesting commencement date. Performance-based\nrestricted stock units typically vest on the earliest date that any\n101\nof the following occurs: (i) the Company attains an incremental capital investment, or (ii) other specified performance conditions. Options typically\nexpire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.\nStock Options\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 3,313,080 options outstanding under the 2020 Plan.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s option activity under the 2020 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted-Average\nWeighted- Remaining\nAverage Exercise Contractual Term Aggregate\nOptions Price (years) Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 3,697,649 $ 9.71 9.07 $ (18,077,872)\nGranted 288,300 5.28\nExercised - -\nCancelled or forfeited (672,869) 9.26\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 3,313,080 $ 9.27 8.29 (10,726,391)\nOptions exercisable as of December 31, 2023 1,583,171 $ 9.75 7.70 (5,883,276)\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023 3,313,080 $ 9.27 8.29 (10,726,391)\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s unvested option activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted-Average Grant\nNumber of Shares Date Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2022 2,959,596 $ 4.26\nGranted 288,300 2.53\nVested (1,052,229) 4.22\nForfeited (465,758) 4.40\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 1,729,909 $ 3.96\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $2.53 and\n$4.16, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested stock options was $6.7 million, which is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted average period of 2.40 years.\nThe fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the assumptions used for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, presented on a weighted average basis:\nYear ended December 31, 2023 Year ended December 31, 2022\nExercise price $ 5.28 $ 9.20\nFair market value $ 2.53 $ 4.16\nExpected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0%\nExpected term (in years) 6.1 6.1\nExpected volatility 43.81% 42.13%\nWeighted-average risk-free rate 3.75% 3.24%\nRestricted Stock Units\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 2,879,418 restricted stock units outstanding under the 2020 Plan.\n102\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s unvested restricted stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date Fair\nNumber of Shares Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2022 3,246,220 $ 9.65\nGranted 661,348 4.96\nVested (822,275) 10.10\nForfeited (205,875) 8.69\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 2,879,418 $ 8.51\nAs of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested restricted stock units was $12.9 million, which is\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.31 years.\nSpaceMobile 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn connection with the Business Combination, the Company adopted the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The aggregate number of\ncommon stock shares that may be issued pursuant to rights granted under the ESPP is 2,000,000 shares. If any right granted under the ESPP shall for\nany reason terminate without having been exercised, the shares not purchased under such right shall again become available for issuance under the\nESPP. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not issued any awards under the ESPP.\n13. Nano\nOn September 6, 2022, AST LLC completed the sale of its 51% interest in its former subsidiary, Nano to Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace AS, a\nprivate limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Norway (“Kongsberg”) for net proceeds of $26.6 million.\nThe carrying amount of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interest attributable to Nano were deconsolidated on September 6, 2022 and the\nCompany recognized a net gain of $24.5 million in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The accompanying consolidated financial statements for year ended December 31, 2022 included the results of operations and\ncash flows of Nano up to the date of sale of Nano. The revenues and cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were exclusively related to\nNano.\nNano recognized revenue related to sales of manufactured small satellites and their components, as well as launch-related services. This was the\nCompany’s only source of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 and until the sale of Nano on September 6, 2022. Revenue recognized\nover time versus revenue recognized upon transfer during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nRevenue from performance obligations recognized over time $ 12,491\nRevenue from performance obligations recognized at point-in-time transfer 1,334\nTotal $ 13,825\n14. Income Taxes\nThe Company, organized as a C corporation, owns an equity interest in AST LLC in what is commonly referred to as an “Up-C” structure. For U.S.\nfederal and state income tax purposes, AST LLC has elected to be treated as a partnership and does not pay any income taxes since its income and\nlosses are included in the returns of the members. The portion of the Company’s taxable income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests of\nAST LLC is taxed directly to such members. Consequently, no provision for income taxes, has been included in the financial statements related to this\nportion of taxable income. Certain foreign wholly-owned entities are taxed as corporations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, and accruals for\nsuch taxes are included in the consolidated financial statements. The Company has operations in India, Scotland, Spain, Israel and Lithuania (through\nSeptember 6, 2022) with tax filings in each foreign jurisdiction.\n103\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nUnited States $ (230,487) $ (98,774)\nForeign 9,491 (3,722)\nTotal $ (220,996) $ (102,496)\nThe income tax expense (benefit) was as follows (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ -\nState - -\nForeign 2,576 617\nTotal current 2,576 617\nDeferred:\nFederal - -\nState - -\nForeign (895) -\nTotal deferred (895) -\nTotal income tax provision $ 1,681 $ 617\nThe differences between the effective income tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate are as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nStatutory U.S. federal income tax rate 21% 21%\nIncome (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest and non taxable income (loss) (13%) (16%)\nChanges in fair value of warrant liabilities 1% 4%\nChange in valuation allowance (10%) (10%)\nResearch and development credit 1% 2%\nOther (1%) (2%)\nEffective income tax rate (1%) (1%)\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for\nfinancial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in\nthousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 21,965 $ 11,788\nBasis difference in the equity of AST LLC 95,170 79,396\nResearch and development credit 6,524 3,172\nOther 635 508\nTotal deferred tax assets 124,294 94,864\nValuation allowance (123,399) (94,864)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 895 $ -\n104\nAs of December 31, 2023 the Company had unused federal net operating loss carryforwards (gross) for federal income tax purposes of approximately\n$99.4 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely and may be used to offset future taxable income. In addition, the Company had unused net\noperating loss carryforwards (gross) for state income tax purposes of approximately $5.6 million, $0.7 million of which expire in 2041. The remaining\n$4.9 million state net operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also had unused net operating loss carryforwards (gross) for\nforeign income tax purposes of approximately $3.0 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.\nManagement assesses the need for a valuation allowance in each tax paying component or jurisdiction based upon the available positive and negative\nevidence to estimate whether sufficient taxable income will exist to permit realization of the deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company's valuation allowance was $123.4 million and $94.9 million, respectively. The change from December 31,\n2022 to December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by the basis difference in the equity of AST LLC and an increase in the net operating loss\ncarryforward in the U.S. jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2023, there is no valuation allowance recorded against the foreign deferred tax assets of\n$0.9 million as it is more likely than not that the foreign deferred tax assets will be fully realized. The foreign deferred tax asset is subject to foreign\nexchange risk, which could reduce the amount the Company may ultimately realize. Additionally, future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such\ntax laws may limit the Company’s ability to fully utilize the foreign net operating loss carryforwards.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits.\nThere were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not\naware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with the Closing, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Company\nis generally required to pay the TRA Holders 85.0% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign taxes that are based on,\nor measured with respect to, net income or profits, and any interest related thereto that the Company and any applicable consolidated, unitary, or\ncombined Subsidiaries (the “Tax Group”) realize, or are deemed to realize, as a result of certain “Tax Attributes,” which include:\n• existing tax basis in certain assets of AST LLC and certain of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including assets that will eventually be\nsubject to depreciation or amortization, once placed in service, attributable to AST LLC Common Units acquired by the Company from a\nTRA Holder (including AST LLC Common Units held by a Blocker Corporation acquired by us in a Reorganization Transaction (as defined\nin the Tax Receivable Agreement)), each as determined at the time of the relevant acquisition;\n• tax basis adjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of AST LLC Common Units (including any such adjustments resulting from certain\npayments made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement) acquired by the Company from a TRA Holder pursuant to the terms of the A&R\nOperating Agreement;\n• tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement; and\n• certain tax attributes of Blocker Corporations holding AST LLC Common Units that are acquired directly or indirectly by the Company\npursuant to a Reorganization Transaction.\nSome circumstances, such as the Company’s election to terminate early the TRA or certain changes of control of the Company or AST LLC (as\ndescribed in the A&R Operating Agreement), may require the Company to make lump-sum cash payments based on certain assumptions to all the\nTRA Holders equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be the obligations of the Company and not obligations of AST LLC. Any\npayments made by the Company under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have\notherwise been available to the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there have been no TRA liabilities recorded.\n15. Net Loss per Share\nBasic and diluted net loss per share attributable to the holders of Class A Common Stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common\nstockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding during the period.\n105\nThe following table sets forth reconciliations of the numerators and denominators used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share of Class A\nCommon Stock (in thousands, except share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNumerator\nNet loss before allocation to noncontrolling interest $ (222,677) $ (103,113)\nNet loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest (135,116) (71,473)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders - basic and diluted $ (87,561) $ (31,640)\nDenominator\nWeighted-average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding -\nbasic and diluted 81,824,122 54,437,073\nNet loss per share attributable to holders of Class A Common Stock -\nbasic and diluted $ (1.07) $ (0.58)\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share 50,041,757 shares of Class B Common Stock,\n78,163,078 shares of Class C Common Stock, 11,547,600 Public Warrants, 6,050,000 Private Placement Warrants, and 1,208,125 unvested\nperformance-based restricted stock units as their effect would have been to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of\nshares of Class A Common Stock outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share of Class A Common Stock is the same.\nShares of the Company’s Class B and Class C Common Stock do not participate in the earnings or losses of the Company and are therefore not\nparticipating securities. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted loss per share of Class B and Class C Common Stock under the two-class\nmethod has not been presented.\n16. Related Parties\nVodafone\nAST LLC and Vodafone have agreed to enter into one or more definitive agreements for a commercial partnership that is anticipated to use the\nSpaceMobile Service (the “Vodafone Commercial Agreements”). In connection with the commercial agreement, AST LLC, its subsidiaries, and\naffiliates have agreed not to enter into any agreement, term sheet, or letter of intent that grants another party the rights related to the provision of\nmobile services in the Vodafone markets or Vodafone partner markets prior to the execution of the Vodafone Commercial Agreements.\nThe Vodafone Commercial Agreements are to include mutual exclusivity, conditioned upon Vodafone making the SpaceMobile Service available to\nall of its customers and certain promotional efforts, within all Vodafone markets for five years commencing on the launch of a commercial service in\nall of the Vodafone markets; preferential commercial terms in Vodafone partner markets; 50/50 revenue share for the SpaceMobile Service in\nVodafone exclusivity markets; and the procurement, building and operating of mobile network ground stations at a mutually agreed cost by Vodafone.\nNo payments have been made to date between AST LLC and Vodafone pursuant to the anticipated Vodafone Commercial Agreements. Vodafone has\nthe right to designate one individual to the Company’s Board of Directors. Currently, Vodafone’s designee is Luke Ibbetson, Head of Group Research\n& Development, Vodafone.\nAST LLC entered into a side letter with Vodafone dated December 15, 2020, under which AST LLC has agreed (i) not to enter into any material\ncorporate strategic relationship or material commercial agreement with a party other than Vodafone and its affiliates that would be reasonably\nexpected to materially frustrate AST LLC’s ability to satisfy the obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements with certain exceptions; (ii)\nto allocate sufficient funds in the capital budget to facilitate compliance with the obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements; and (iii)\nnot to alter the business plan in a manner that is materially detrimental to AST LLC’s ability to satisfy the obligations under the Vodafone Commercial\nAgreements.\nOn January 16, 2024, the Company entered into a Convertible Security Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Vodafone. Pursuant\nto the Investment Agreement, Vodafone agreed to purchase the Company’s subordinated convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $25.0\nmillion (such notes, the “Notes” and such investments, the “Investments”). In connection with the Investments, Vodafone Group Services Limited\n(“Vodafone Group Services”) have entered into letter agreements with AST LLC and the Company (the “Letter Agreements”). The letter agreement\nbetween Vodafone Group Services and AST LLC provides, among other things, for an initial revenue commitment of $25.0 million to AST LLC to be\npaid by Vodafone Group\n106\nServices over a two and a half year period to be defined in a future definitive agreement for AST LLC to provide connectivity services. Also,\nVodafone submitted a purchase order for network equipment from AST LLC to support planned commercial service.\nAmerican Tower\nAST LLC and American Tower have entered into a side letter agreement which was subsequently amended and restated on December 15, 2020. The\nside letter contemplates that AST LLC and American Tower will enter into commercial agreements to use American Tower facilities for the terrestrial\ngateway facilities in certain markets. The term of the operational agreement with American Tower is for an anticipated five years after the initial\nlaunch of commercial mobile services by AST LLC.\nOn March 22, 2022, AST LLC and American Tower entered into a non-binding term sheet reflecting the terms and conditions for the deployment of\nAST LLC gateway satellite technology equipment on property owned and operated by American Tower. Under the agreement, American Tower will\nprovide AST LLC leased space and managed services at its current and future tower sites and data centers under the global master lease agreement to\nbe entered into by the parties.\nThe usage of any American Tower services in a Vodafone market will be memorialized in a commercial agreement among all three parties. In markets\nwhere Vodafone does not operate (“Carrier Neutral Markets”), AST LLC and American Tower may enter into an agreement for American Tower to\nmanage the operation of our deployed gateway facility in such market. In Carrier Neutral Markets where the Company requires a third party to\nprovide a gateway facility or services, AST LLC agrees to not accept any bid that is inferior to American Tower’s best and final proposal for such\ngateway facility or services. AST LLC also agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to utilize American Tower facilities in (i) Vodafone markets\nwhere Vodafone decides to not use its facilities, (ii) in Carrier Neutral Markets, and (iii) instances where the Company requires a third-party vendor.\nAdditionally, AST LLC will work with American Tower to evaluate and plan gateway facility and radio access network data center deployments with\npreferred vendor status to offer carrier-neutral hosting facilities in certain equatorial markets. American Tower will serve as the preferred vendor for\ncarrier neutral hosting facilities. AST LLC will pay American Tower a monthly connection fee for use of a carrier neutral hosting facility, which AST\nLLC expects will be charged back to each applicable Mobile Network Operator (“MNO”). If AST LLC and American Tower agree to construct a new\ncarrier neutral hosting facility or improve an existing one and American Tower elects to fund all such capital expenditures, American Tower will\nprovide AST LLC with a fair-market, long-term lease to such facility. No payments have been made to date between AST LLC and American Tower\nunder the Amended and Restated Letter Agreement. American Tower has the right to designate one individual to the Company’s Board of Directors.\nCurrently, American Tower's designee is Ed Knapp, Chief Technology Officer, American Tower.\nRakuten\nOn February 4, 2020, AST LLC entered into a commercial agreement with Rakuten for the development of exclusive network capabilities in Japan\ncompatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates, which agreement was amended and restated as of December 15, 2020 (the “Rakuten\nAgreement”). Under the terms of the Rakuten Agreement, AST LLC agreed to make investments in building network capabilities in Japan that are\ncompatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates. Furthermore, AST LLC will collaborate with Rakuten to ensure network capability\nwith Rakuten’s licensed frequencies, including full coverage in Japan with 3GPP Band 3 frequencies with multiple input multiple output (“MIMO”)\ncapability. Upon the launch of such coverage, Rakuten will receive unlimited, exclusive rights and usage capacity in Japan in exchange for a $0.5\nmillion annual maintenance fee payable to AST LLC or our successors. Furthermore, AST LLC will make $5.0 million (or such lesser amount as\nmutually agreed upon the parties) in capital investments towards the design, assembly, acquisition and implementation of ground communication\nassets. AST LLC and Rakuten will receive unlimited rights and usage of the ground assets for their respective operations, including, but not limited to,\nsatellite and other telecommunication communications. The term of the Rakuten Agreement shall remain in effect until AST LLC fulfills obligations\nunder the Rakuten Agreement. Rakuten has the right to designate two individuals to the Company’s Board of Directors. Currently, Rakuten has\ndesignated Hiroshi Mikitani, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rakuten, Inc. as a director and has the right to designate another\nindividual.\nThe Rakuten Agreement includes key performance indicators (“KPIs”) associated with the number of satellites launched, timing and coverage of the\nSpaceMobile Service in Japan in a phased manner that AST LLC was obligated to meet by June 2023. In connection with AST LLC’s inability to\nmeet the applicable KPIs stated in the Rakuten Agreement by the deadline, the Company recognized an expense of $10.0 million recorded in Other\n(expense) income, net in the first quarter of 2023 and paid the amount in the third quarter of 2023.\n107\nInvesat and Antares Technologies\nOn March 4, 2024, the Company and Invesat LLC (“Invesat”), which is part of the Cisneros Group of Companies, of which Ms. Adriana Cisneros, a\nmember of the Company's Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer, completed a series of transactions (including a Blocker Merger\nTransaction as defined in the A&R Operating Agreement, the “Transactions”) resulting in the acquisition by Antares of 10,445,200 shares of the\nCompany’s Class A Common Stock. As part of the Transactions, 9,932,541 shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and 200,000 shares of\nthe Company’s Class A Common Stock previously held by Invesat were cancelled.\nAs part of the Transactions, AST SpaceMobile Holdings II, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into\nInvesat, with Invesat surviving such merger (the “First Merger”) and, immediately following the First Merger, Invesat merged with and into AST\nSpaceMobile Holdings, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of us (“AST Holdings”), with AST Holdings surviving such merger (the\n“Second Merger”). After giving effect to the Transactions, the separate limited liability company existence of Invesat ceased.\nIn connection with the Transactions, the Company has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to take steps necessary to allow for the\namendment and/or assignment of each of the Stockholders’ Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, within forty-five (45) days after the\nclosings of the Transactions, to add an affiliate of Invesat, Antares, and remove Invesat as a party thereto to allow Antares to benefit from all of the\nrights previously held by Invesat thereunder. In the event that the Registration Rights Agreement and the Stockholders’ Agreement are not amended\nand/or assigned with such forty-five (45)-day period, the Company has agreed to enter into a separate letter agreement with Antares which provides\nAntares with substantially the same rights as those held by Invesat LLC under each of the Registration Rights Agreement and the Stockholders’\nAgreement.\n17. Subsequent Events\nConvertible Security Investment Agreement\nOn January 16, 2024, the Company entered into a Convertible Security Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with AT&T, Google and\nVodafone (the “Investors”). Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Investors have agreed to purchase the Company’s subordinated convertible\nnotes for an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million (such notes, the “Notes” and such investments, the “Investments”).\nThe Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, beginning on June 30,\n2024. The Company has the option to pay interest on the Notes in cash or in kind. If the Company elects to pay interest on the Notes in kind, the\nprincipal amount of the Notes will be increased by the amount of the interest payment, and interest will accrue on such increased principal amount in\nsubsequent interest periods. The Notes have a ten-year term unless earlier converted.\nThe holders of the Notes (the “Holders”) may convert the Notes (subject to certain exceptions) at an initial conversion rate of 173.9130 shares of Class\nA Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $5.75 per share of Class A Common Stock). The\nHolders may convert their Notes at their option at any time on or after January 16, 2025. The Holders will also have the right to convert the Notes\nprior to January 16, 2025 in the event that the Company undergoes a fundamental change (defined to include change of control, certain mergers of the\nCompany with another company, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, and liquidation). The conversion rate is also subject\nto customary anti-dilution adjustments if certain events occur.\nOn or after January 16, 2025, the Company may require the Holders to convert the Notes (subject to certain exceptions), at an initial conversion rate\nof 173.9130 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $5.75 per share of\nClass A Common Stock) at its option, if the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for 30\nconsecutive trading days, on the immediately succeeding trading day after the last trading day of such 30 day period.\nThe Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default and fundamental change. In the case of an event of default with respect\nto the Notes arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on,\nthe Notes will automatically become due and payable. If any other event of default with respect to the Notes occurs or is continuing (which include\ncustomary events of default, including the failure to pay principal or interest when due and the failure to comply with other covenants contained in the\nInvestment Agreement), the Holders of at least 60% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Subordinated Obligations (as defined in the\nInvestment Agreement to include the obligations under the Notes) may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be immediately due and payable.\nIn the\n108\ncase of fundamental change as defined in the Investment Agreement prior to the conversion or maturity of the Notes, the Company is required to\nrepay the Notes immediately prior to the consummation of such fundamental change in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such\nNotes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\nLetter Agreements\nOn January 16, 2024, in connection with the Investments, each of AT&T Services, Inc.

(formerly known as New Providence Acquisitions Corp.) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe following summary of the material terms of our capital stock is not intended to be a complete summary of the rights and preferences of such\nsecurities and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our second Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”), our amended and restated Bylaws (the\n“Bylaws”) and the Warrant Agreement, dated as of September 13, 2019, between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and the Company (the\n“Warrant Agreement”), all of which are attached as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “Annual\nReport”). The summary below is also qualified by reference to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), as\napplicable. You are encouraged to read the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the Charter and the Bylaws in their entirety for a complete description of\nthe rights and preferences of our securities.\nAuthorized and Outstanding Capital Stock\nOur Charter authorizes the issuance of 1,225,000,000 shares, of which 800,000,000 shares are shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001\nper share (“Class A Common Stock”), 200,000,000 shares are shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B Common Stock”),\n125,000,000 shares are shares of Class C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class C Common Stock”, and, together with the Class A Common\nStock and Class B Common Stock, the “Common Stock”), 100,000,000 shares are shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share with such\ndesignation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors”).\nOn February 16, 2023, we filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 205 of the DGCL seeking (i) the validation of the\nApril 1, 2021 stockholder vote approving the proposal to amend and restate our certificate of incorporation, in the current form of our Charter (including its\nfiling and effectiveness, in each case as of April 6, 2021) (the “Charter Proposal”), and (ii) the validation and declaration of effectiveness of (a) our Charter\nand (b) the securities issued or to be issued in reliance on the approval of the Charter and/or the Charter Proposal, as of the respective dates of issuance to\nresolve any uncertainty with respect to those matters (captioned, In re AST SpaceMobile, Inc., C.A. No. 2023-0202-LWW (Del. Ch.)). On March 14, 2023,\nthe Court of Chancery approved our request for relief and entered an order under Section 205 of the DGCL.\nAs of March 28, 2024, we had approximately 138,132,310 shares of Class A Common Stock, 39,747,448 shares of Class B Common Stock,\n78,163,078 shares of Class C Common Stock and warrants to purchase 17,597,600 shares of Class A Common Stock, issued and outstanding. As of such\ndate, there were 25 holders of record of Class A Common Stock, four holders of record of Class B Common Stock, one holder of record of Class C\nCommon Stock and five holders of record of warrants.\nCommon Stock\nVoting\nUnder our Charter, holders of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock will vote together as a single class on\nall matters submitted to the stockholders for their vote or approval, except as required by applicable law. Holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B\nCommon Stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to the stockholders for their vote or approval. Prior to the Sunset Date, the\nholders of Class C Common Stock are entitled to the lesser of (i) 10 votes per share and (ii) the Class C Share Voting Amount on all matters submitted to\nstockholders for their vote or approval. From and after the Sunset Date, which, as defined in the Stockholders’ Agreement, is the earliest to occur of (i) the\nretirement or resignation of Abel Avellan, AST SpaceMobile’s Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“Avellan”) from the Board of Directors,\n(ii) the date on which Avellan and his permitted transferees beneficially own less than 20% of the Class A Common Stock that Avellan beneficially owns as\nof immediately after the closing of the initial business combination (the “Business\nEXHIBIT 4.1\nCombination”) contemplated by that certain Equity Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2020, by and among AST & Science LLC (“AST &\nScience”), New Providence Acquisition Corp. (“NPA”), New Providence Management LLC, the AST Existing Equityholder Representative and the AST\nExisting Equityholders (the “Equity Purchase Agreement”, and such closing of the Business Combination, the “Closing”) and (iii) Avellan’s death or\npermanent incapacitation, holders of Class C Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share.\nAs of March 28, 2024, Avellan and his permitted transferees control, as a group, approximately 81.5% of the combined voting power of the\nCommon Stock as a result of their ownership of all of the Class C Common Stock. Accordingly, Avellan controls the Company’s business policies and\naffairs and can control any action requiring the general approval of its stockholders, including the election of our Board of Directors, the adoption of\namendments to its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and approval of any merger or sale of substantially all of its assets. Until the Sunset Date, Avellan\nwill continue to control the outcome of matters submitted to the stockholders.\nDividends\nThe holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends, as and if declared by our Board of Directors out of legally available funds.\nWith respect to stock dividends, holders of Class A Common Stock must receive Class A Common Stock.\nThe holders of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock will not have any right to receive dividends other than stock dividends\nconsisting of shares of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as applicable, in each case paid proportionally with respect to each outstanding\nshare of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock.\nLiquidation or Dissolution\nUpon our liquidation or dissolution, the holders of all classes of Common Stock are entitled to their respective par value, and the holders of Class A\nCommon Stock will then be entitled to share ratably in those of our assets that are legally available for distribution to stockholders after payment of\nliabilities and subject to the prior rights of any holders of preferred stock then outstanding. Other than their par value, the holders of Class B Common\nStock and Class C Common Stock will not have any right to receive a distribution upon a liquidation or dissolution of the Company.\nConversion, Transferability and Exchange\nSubject to the terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of AST & Science (the “A&R Operating\nAgreement”), the members of AST & Science (other than the Company) may from time to time cause AST & Science to redeem any or all of their units of\nownership interest in AST & Science which entitles the holder thereof to the distributions, allocations, and other rights under the A&R Operating\nAgreement (the “AST Common Units”) in exchange for, at the Company’s election (subject to certain exceptions), either cash (based on the market price\nfor a share of the Class A Common Stock) (the “Existing Equityholder Cash Out”) or shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Existing Equityholder Share\nSettlement”); provided that the Company’s election to effect such redemption as an Existing Equityholder Cash Out or an Existing Equityholder Share\nSettlement must be approved by a committee of the our Board of Directors comprised solely of directors who were not nominated pursuant to the\nStockholders’ Agreement or other contractual right by, and are not otherwise affiliated with, holders of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock.\nAt the Company’s election, such transaction may be effectuated via a direct exchange of Class A Common Stock or cash by the Company for the redeemed\nAST Common Units (an “Existing Equityholder Direct Exchange”).\nOur Charter provides that (a) if a holder of Class B Common Stock exercises either the Existing Equityholder Cash Out, or the Existing\nEquityholder Share Settlement or Existing Equityholder Direct Exchange (collectively, the “Existing Equityholder Conversion”), then the number of shares\nof Class B Common Stock held by such holder equal to the number of AST Common Units so redeemed, cashed out or exchanged will automatically be\ncancelled by the Company for no consideration and (b) if a holder of Class C Common Stock (i) exercises the Existing Equityholder Cash Out or (ii)\nexercises the Existing Equityholder Share Settlement or Existing Equityholder Direct Exchange and subsequently transfers the Class A Common Stock\nissued in connection with such redemption and exchange to a\nEXHIBIT 4.1\nperson or entity other than Avellan and his permitted transferees, then the number of Class C Common Stock held by such holder equal to the number of\nAST Common Units so redeemed and exchanged then transferred or cashed out will automatically be cancelled by the Company for no consideration. If\nAvellan and his permitted transferees exercise the Existing Equityholder Conversion, then the voting power of the Class C Common Stock is reduced\ncommensurate with the voting power of the newly issued Class A Common Stock. The voting power of the Class C Common Stock will be further adjusted\nif Avellan or his permitted transferees transfers Class A Common Stock to a person or entity that is not Avellan or his permitted transferees.\nWe may not issue Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock such that after the issuance of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common\nStock the holder of such stock does not hold an identical number of AST Common Units.\nOther Provisions\nNone of the Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock has any pre-emptive or other subscription rights.\nPreferred Stock\nWe are authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by\nDelaware law and our Charter, to determine the terms and conditions of the preferred stock, including whether the shares of preferred stock will be issued\nin one or more series, the number of shares to be included in each series and the powers (including the voting power), designations, preferences and rights\nof the shares. Our Board of Directors also will be authorized to designate any qualifications, limitations or restrictions on the shares without any further\nvote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the\nCompany and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common\nStock, which could have a negative impact on the market price of the Class A Common Stock.\nRedeemable Warrants\nPublic Warrants\nEach whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to\nadjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, a\nwarrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A Common Stock. This means that only a whole warrant may be\nexercised at any given time by a warrant holder. The warrants will expire on April 6, 2026, five years after the completion of the Business Combination, at\n5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nWe are not obligated to deliver any shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle\nsuch warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the warrants\nis then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to us satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant\nwill be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of a warrant unless, if at the time, the Class A\nCommon Stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of\nresidence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect\nto a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event\nwill we be required to net cash settle any warrant.\nWe are obligated to file and maintain an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Class A Common Stock\nissuable upon exercise of the warrants and to use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to maintain the effectiveness of\nsuch registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the Warrant\nAgreement. Pursuant to such obligations, on May 6, 2021, we filed a Form S-1 covering the shares of Class A Common\nEXHIBIT 4.1\nStock issuable upon exercise and on June 10, 2022, we filed a Form S-3 covering the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise, which was\ndeclared effective on July 1, 2022. Notwithstanding the above, if Class A Common Stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national\nsecurities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require\nholders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the\nevent we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event we do not so elect, we will use our\ncommercially reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.\nWe may call the warrants for redemption:\n● in whole and not in part;\n● at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n● upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and\n● if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock\nsplits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending\nthree trading days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.\nWe may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from\nregistration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or we are unable to effect such registration or qualification.\nWe have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a\nsignificant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant\nholder will be entitled to exercise its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A Common Stock may fall below the\n$18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) as well as the $11.50 warrant\nexercise price after the redemption notice is issued.\nIf we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its\nwarrant to do so on a “cashless basis.” In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a “cashless basis,” our management will\nconsider, among other factors, its cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on its stockholders of issuing the\nmaximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, all\nholders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient\nobtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the\nexercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (as defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The “fair\nmarket value” shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to\nthe date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. If we select this option, the notice of redemption will contain the information\nnecessary to calculate the number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be received upon exercise of the warrants, including the “fair market value” in\nsuch case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant\nredemption. We believe this feature is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants. If we call our warrants for\nredemption and our management does not take advantage of this option, New Providence Acquisition Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability\ncompany (the “Sponsor”) and its permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis\nusing the same formula described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their\nwarrants on a cashless basis, as described in more detail below.\nEXHIBIT 4.1\nA holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to\nexercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s\nactual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 4.9% or 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the shares of Class A Common\nStock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.\nIf the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, or\nby a split-up of shares of Class A Common Stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the\nnumber of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares\nof Class A Common Stock. A rights offering to holders of Class A Common Stock entitling holders to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock at a price\nless than the fair market value will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of\nshares of Class A Common Stock actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are\nconvertible into or exercisable for Class A Common Stock) and (ii) one (1) minus the quotient of (x) the price per share of Class A Common Stock paid in\nsuch rights offering divided by (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Class\nA Common Stock, in determining the price payable for Class A Common Stock, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights,\nas well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted average price of Class A\nCommon Stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of Class A Common\nStock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.\nIn addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other\nassets to the holders of Class A Common Stock on account of such shares of Class A Common Stock (or other shares of our capital stock into which the\nwarrants are convertible), other than (i) as described above or, (ii) certain ordinary cash dividends (initially defined as up to $0.50 per share in a 365 day\nperiod), then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair\nmarket value of any securities or other assets paid on each share of Class A Common Stock in respect of such event.\nIf the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or\nreclassification of shares of Class A Common Stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock\nsplit, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion\nto such decrease in outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock.\nWhenever the number of shares of Class A Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the\nwarrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of\nwhich will be the number of shares of Class A Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y)\nthe denominator of which will be the number of shares of Class A Common Stock so purchasable immediately thereafter.\nIn case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (other than those described above or that\nsolely affects the par value of such shares of Class A Common Stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another entity (other\nthan a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our\noutstanding shares of Class A Common Stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of our assets or other property as\nan entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase\nand receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the shares of Class A Common Stock immediately\ntheretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or\nproperty (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or\ntransfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. If less than 70% of\nthe consideration receivable by the holders of Class A Common Stock in such a transaction is payable in the form of Class\nEXHIBIT 4.1\nA Common Stock in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market,\nor is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within\nthirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the Warrant Agreement based on the\nBlack-Scholes value (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) of the warrant. The purpose of such exercise price reduction is to provide additional value to\nholders of the warrants when an extraordinary transaction occurs during the exercise period of the warrants pursuant to which the holders of the warrants\notherwise do not receive the full potential value of the warrants in order to determine and realize the option value component of the warrant. This formula\nis to compensate the warrant holder for the loss of the option value portion of the warrant due to the requirement that the warrant holder exercise the\nwarrant within 30 days of the event. The Black-Scholes model (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) is an accepted pricing model for estimating fair\nmarket value where no quoted market price for an instrument is available.\nThe warrants are issued in registered form under the Warrant Agreement. The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be\namended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least\n65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any other change.\nThe warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with\nthe exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or\non a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not\nhave the rights or privileges of holders of Class A Common Stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of Class A\nCommon Stock. After the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each\nshare held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.\nNo fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a\nfractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued to the\nwarrant holder.\nPrivate Placement Warrants\nThe private placement warrants (including the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) are not\nredeemable by us so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. The Sponsor, or its permitted transferees, has the option to exercise\nthe private placement warrants on a cashless basis. Other than these terms and as described below, the private placement warrants have terms and\nprovisions that are identical to those of the public warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. If the private placement\nwarrants are held by holders other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by\nthe holders on the same basis as the public warrants.\nIf holders of the private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering their\nwarrants for that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A\nCommon Stock underlying the private placement warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” (defined below) over the exercise price of\nthe private placement warrants by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A Common\nStock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent.\nExclusive Forum\nOur Bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we provide notice in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District\nof Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of\nEXHIBIT 4.1\nbreach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or to our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising\npursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Charter or Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal\njurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Our Bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States will\nbe the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. There is uncertainty as to whether a court\nwould enforce such a provision relating to causes of action arising under the Securities Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal\nsecurities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The clauses described above will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by\nthe Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of our Charter and Bylaws\nThe provisions of our Charter and Bylaws and of the DGCL summarized below may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a\ntender offer or takeover attempt that you might consider in your best interest, including an attempt that might result in your receipt of a premium over the\nmarket price for your shares of Class A Common Stock.\nOur Charter and Bylaws will contain certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of\nour Board of Directors and that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing our future takeover or change in control unless such takeover or\nchange in control is approved by our Board of Directors.\nThese provisions include:\nAction by Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders. Our Charter provides that stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special\nmeeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. Our Charter and Bylaws also provide that, subject to any special rights\nof the holders of any series of preferred stock and except as otherwise required by applicable law, special meetings of the stockholders can only be called\nby our Board of Directors, the chairman of our Board of Directors, or, until the earlier of (i) the Sunset Date or (ii) the time we are no longer a “controlled\ncompany,” by our secretary at the request of holders representing a majority of the total voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock entitled to\nvote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Except as described above, stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting or to\nrequire our Board of Directors to call a special meeting.\nAdvance Notice Procedures. Our Bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of\nour stockholders, and for stockholder nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors to be brought before an annual or special meeting of\nstockholders. Stockholders at an annual meeting will only be able to consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before\nthe meeting by or at the direction of our Board of Directors of directors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the record date for the\nmeeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given our Secretary timely written notice, in proper form, of the stockholder’s intention to bring\nthat business or nomination before the meeting. Although our Bylaws do not give our Board of Directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder\nnominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting, as applicable, our Bylaws may have the\neffect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquirer\nfrom conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares. Our authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuance\nwithout stockholder approval, subject to, in the case of the Class A Common Stock, rules of the securities exchange on which the Class A Common Stock\nis listed. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate\nacquisitions, in connection with the redemption or exchange of AST Common Units and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued\nshares of Common Stock and preferred stock, coupled with the extraordinary voting right of\nEXHIBIT 4.1\nthe Class C Common Stock, could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of our Common Stock by means of a proxy\ncontest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\nBusiness Combinations with Interested Stockholders. Our Charter provides that we are not subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law.\nIn general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with an “interested\nstockholder” (which includes a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the date the\nperson became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203.\nLimitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nOur Bylaws limit the liability of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and provides that we will provide them with\ncustomary indemnification and advancement and prepayment of expenses. We have entered into customary indemnification agreements with each of our\nexecutive officers and directors that provide them, in general, with customary indemnification in connection with their service to us or on our behalf.\nOur Bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we provide notice in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii)\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or to our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any\naction, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Charter or Bylaws or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim\nagainst us governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable\nparties named as defendants therein. Our Charter further provides that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for\nresolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a\nprovision relating to causes of action arising under the Securities Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules\nand regulations thereunder. The clauses described above will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nRegistration Rights Agreements\nIn connection with NPA’s IPO, we entered into that certain Registration and Stockholder Rights Agreement, dated as of September 13, 2019, by and\namong the Company, the Sponsor and the other parties thereto (collectively, the “2019 Holders”, and such agreement, the “2019 Registration Rights\nAgreement”) pursuant to which we granted the 2019 Holders certain registration rights with respect to, among other things, the private placement warrants\nand the shares of Class A Common Stock that were issued at the Closing upon conversion of the 2019 Holders’ founder shares. The 2019 Holders of the\nmajority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the 2019\nHolders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities\nAct. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nOn December 16, 2020, we entered into subscription agreements with investors who participated in the Private Investment in Public Equity\nInvestment (such investment, the “PIPE Investment”, such agreements, the “PIPE Subscription Agreements” and such investors, the “PIPE Investors”),\npursuant to which we (i) issued an aggregate of 23,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock to the PIPE Investors at the Closing and (ii) agreed to register\nsuch shares.\nAt the Closing, we entered into the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2021, by and among the Company, the Sponsor and the\nExisting Equityholders (collectively, the “Holders”, and such agreement, the “2021 Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which we granted the\nHolders certain registration rights with respect to the registrable securities of the Company. Among other things, the 2021 Registration Rights Agreement\nrequires us to register the shares of Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the Business Combination and any shares of Class A Common Stock\nissued upon the redemption of any AST Common Units. The Holders are entitled to (i)\nEXHIBIT 4.1\nmake a written demand for registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their shares of Class A Common Stock (up to a maximum of two demands\nin any 12-month period) and not more than five times in the aggregate and only if the offering will include registrable securities with a total offering price\nreasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate, $50 million, and (ii) “piggy-back” registration rights to registration statements filed following the Business\nCombination. We will bear all of the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statement.\nOn January 16, 2024, we entered into a Convertible Security Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with AT&T Venture\nInvestments, LLC, Google LLC, and Vodafone Ventures Limited (together, the “Investors”), pursuant to which the Investors purchased subordinated\nconvertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $110.0 million (such notes, the “Notes”). On January 22, 2024, in connection with the Investment\nAgreement, we entered into an Investor and Registration Rights Agreements with each of the Investors pursuant to which we granted the Investors certain\nregistration rights with respect to their registrable securities of the Company. Among other things, the Investor and Registration Rights Agreements requires\nus to register the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. The Investors will be entitled to (i) make a written demand for\nregistration under the Securities Act of all or part of their shares of Class A Common Stock (up to a maximum of three demands) and only if the offering\nwill include registrable securities with a total offering price reasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate, $50 million, and (ii) “piggy-back” registration\nrights to registration statements filed in the future. We will bear all of the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statement.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent for our Common Stock is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Each person investing in our Class A Common Stock\nheld through The Depository Trust Company must rely on the procedures thereof and on institutions that have accounts therewith to exercise any rights of a\nholder of our Class A Common Stock.\nFor as long as any shares of our Class A Common Stock are listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “Nasdaq”) or on any other stock exchange\noperating in the United States, the laws of the State of New York shall apply to the property law aspects of our Class A Common Stock (including\nsecurities exercisable for or convertible into our Class A Common Stock) reflected in the register administered by our transfer agent.\nWe have listed shares of our Class A Common Stock in registered form and such shares, through the transfer agent, will not be certificated. We have\nappointed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company as our agent in New York to maintain our stockholders’ register on behalf of our Board of\nDirectors and to act as transfer agent and registrar for our Class A Common Stock. Shares of our Class A Common Stock are traded on Nasdaq in book-\nentry form.\nThe warrant agent for the warrants is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.\nListing of Class A Common Stock and Warrants\nOur Class A Common Stock and warrants are listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “ASTS” and “ASTSW,” respectively.\nEXHIBIT 21.1\nSUBSIDIARIES OF AST SPACEMOBILE, INC. *\nEntity Name Jurisdiction of Formation\nAST & Science, LLC Delaware\nAST SpaceMobile Services, LLC (f/k/a AST Services, LLC) Florida\nAST Space Mobile USA LLC (f/k/a AST & Defense, LLC) Delaware\nAST & Science Texas LLC Texas\nAST & Science Iberia, Sociedad Limitada Unipersonal Spain\nAST SpaceMobile UK Limited United Kingdom\nAST & Science Israel Ltd.

POLICY FOR THE\nRECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION\nI. BACKGROUND\nAST SpaceMobile, Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted this policy (this “Policy”) to provide for the recovery or “clawback” of certain incentive\ncompensation in the event of a Restatement. This Policy is intended to comply with, and will be interpreted to be consistent with, the requirements of the\nNasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) Listing Rule 5608. Certain terms used in this Policy are defined in Section VIII below.\nII. STATEMENT OF POLICY\nThe Company shall recover reasonably promptly the amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in the event that the Company\nis required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the\nsecurities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously\nissued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current\nperiod (a “Restatement”).\nThe Company shall recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent provided under\nSection V below.\nIII. SCOPE OF POLICY\nA. Persons Covered and Recovery Period. This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person:\n• after beginning service as an Executive Officer,\n• who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation,\n• while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, and\n• during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement (the “Recovery\nPeriod”).\nNotwithstanding this look-back requirement, the Company is only required to apply this Policy to Incentive-Based Compensation received on or\nafter October 2, 2023.\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation shall be deemed “received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial\nReporting Measure (as defined herein) specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-\nBased Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nB. Transition Period. In addition to the Recovery Period, this Policy applies to any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s\nfiscal year) within or immediately following the Recovery Period (a “Transition Period”), provided that a Transition Period between the last day of the\nCompany’s previous fiscal year end and the first day of the Company’s new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months will be deemed a\ncompleted fiscal year.\nC. Determining the Recovery Period. For purposes of determining the relevant Recovery Period, the date that the Company is required to prepare\nthe Restatement is the earlier to occur of:\n• the date the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”), a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized\nto take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a\nRestatement, and\n• the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement.\nFor clarity, the Company’s obligation to recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation under this Policy is not dependent on if or\nwhen a Restatement is filed.\nD. Method of Recovery. The Committee will have discretion in determining how to accomplish recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based\nCompensation under this Policy, recognizing that different means of recovery may be appropriate in different circumstances.\nIV. AMOUNT SUBJECT TO RECOVERY\nA. Recoverable Amount. The amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery under this Policy is the amount of Incentive-Based\nCompensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based\non the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid.\nB. Covered Compensation Based on Stock Price or TSR. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return\n(“TSR”), where the amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the\ninformation in a Restatement, the recoverable amount shall be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) based on a\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received. In such event,\nthe Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq.\nV. EXCEPTIONS\nThe Company shall recover erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent that the\nconditions set out below are met and the Committee has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable:\nA. Direct Expense Exceeds Recoverable Amount. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the\namount to be recovered; provided, however, that before concluding it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded Incentive-\nBased Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded Incentive-\nBased Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to Nasdaq.\nB. Recovery from Certain Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which\nbenefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations\nthereunder.\nVI. PROHIBITION AGAINST INDEMNIFICATION\nNotwithstanding the terms of any indemnification arrangement or insurance policy with any individual covered by this Policy, the Company shall not\nindemnify any Executive Officer or former Executive Officer against the loss of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, including any\npayment or reimbursement for the cost of insurance obtained by any such covered individual to fund amounts recoverable under this Policy.\nVII. DISCLOSURE\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy and recoveries under this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the U.S.\nFederal securities laws, including the disclosure required by the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings.\nVIII. DEFINITIONS\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions apply for purposes of this Policy:\n“Executive Officer” means the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer,\nthe controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance),\nany other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive\nofficers of the Company’s subsidiaries are deemed Executive Officers of the Company if they perform such policy-making functions for the Company.\nPolicy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. Identification of an Executive Officer for purposes of\nthis Policy will include at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to 17 CFR 229.401(b).\n“Financial Reporting Measures” means any of the following: (i) measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting\nprinciples used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, (ii) stock price\nand (iii) TSR. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a\nFinancial Reporting Measure.\nIX. ADMINISTRATION; AMENDMENT; TERMINATION.\nAll determinations under this Policy will be made by the Committee, including determinations regarding how any recovery under this Policy is\neffected. Any determinations of the Committee will be final, binding and conclusive and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by\nthis Policy.\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time and may terminate this Policy at any time, in each case in its sole discretion.\nX. EFFECTIVENESS; OTHER RECOUPMENT RIGHTS\nThis Policy shall be effective as of December 1, 2023. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other\nremedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates under applicable law or pursuant to the terms of\nany similar policy or similar provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement or similar agreement."
