AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT\nMARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor the convenience of readers and for information purpose only, the auditors’ report and the accompanying\nfinancial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in\nthe Republic of China. In the event of any discrepancy between the English version and the original Chinese\nversion or any differences in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language auditors’ report and\nfinancial statements shall prevail.\n~1~\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT TRANSLATED FROM CHINESE\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Evergreen Marine Corporation (Taiwan)\nLtd.\nIntroduction\nWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evergreen Marine\nCorporation (Taiwan) Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred\nherin as the “Group”) as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for the three-\nmonth periods then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a\nsummary of material accounting policies. Management is responsible for the preparation\nand fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the\n“Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers” and\nthe International Accounting Standard 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” that came into\neffect as endorsed by the Financial Supervisory Commission. Our responsibility is to\nexpress a conclusion on these consolidated financial statements based on our reviews.\n~2~\nScope of Review\nExcept as explained in the following paragraph, we conducted our reviews in accordance\nwith the Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Financial Information\nPerformed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” of the Republic of China. A review\nof consolidated financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review\nprocedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit and consequently does\nnot enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters\nthat might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nBasis for qualified conclusion\nAs explained in Note 6(8), we did not review the financial statements of certain\ninvestments accounted for using equity method, which statements reflect investments\naccounted for using equity method of NT$5,607,527 thousand and NT$3,566,896\nthousand, constituting 0.72% and 0.40% of the consolidated total assets as of March 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, and comprehensive income and loss under the equity method\nof NT$116,129 thousand, NT$95,173 thousand, constituting 0.35% and 3.64% of the\nconsolidated total comprehensive income and loss for the three-month periods then ended.\nThese amounts and the related information disclosed in Note 13 were based on the\nunreviewed financial statements of such investee companies.\n~3~\nQualified conclusion\nBased on our reviews and the reports of other independent auditors (please refer to Other\nMatter of the report), except for the possible effects on the consolidated financial\nstatements, if any, as might have been determined to be necessary had the financial\nstatements of certain investments accounted for using equity method and the related\ninformation disclosed in Note 13 been reviewed by independent auditors as explained in\nthe preceding paragraph, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements do not present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as of March 31, 2024 and 2023,\nand its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the three-\nmonth periods then ended in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation\nof Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and International Accounting Standard 34,\n“Interim Financial Reporting” that came into effect as endorsed by the Financial\nSupervisory Commission.\nOther matter – Review reports of other independent auditors\nWe did not review the financial statements of certain consolidated subsidiaries and\ninvestments accounted for using equity method. Those financial statements were reviewed\nby other independent auditors, whose reports thereon have been furnished to us, and our\nreport expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included in the financial\nstatements and the information disclosed in Note 13 was based solely on the review reports\nof other independent auditors. These statements reflect total assets including investments\naccounted for using equity method of NT$67,198,264 thousand and NT$89,067,642\nthousand, constituting 8.59% and 9.99% of the consolidated total assets as of March 31,\n2024 and 2023, and total operating revenues of NT$458,838 thousand and NT$764,507\n~4~\nthousand, constituting 0.52% and 1.14%, of the consolidated total operating revenues for\nthe three-month periods then ended. The comprehensive income and loss under equity\nmethod was NT$(41,532) thousand and NT$1,041,840 thousand, constituting (0.12%)\nand 39.86% of the consolidated total comprehensive income and loss for the three-month\nperiods then ended.\nLai, Chung-Hsi\nChou, Hsiao-Tzu\nFor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Taiwan\nMay 14, 2024\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are not intended to present the financial position and\nresults of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\ncountries and jurisdictions other than the Republic of China. The standards, procedures and practices in the\nRepublic of China governing the audit of such financial statements may differ from those generally accepted\nin countries and jurisdictions other than the Republic of China. Accordingly, the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements and independent auditors’ report are not intended for use by those who\nare not informed about the accounting principles or auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic\nof China, and their applications in practice.\nAs the financial statements are the responsibility of the management, PricewaterhouseCoopers cannot\naccept any liability for the use of, or reliance on, the English translation or for any errors or\nmisunderstandings that may derive from the translation.\n~5~\nEVERGREEN MARINE CORPORATION (TAIWAN) LTD.

Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected\nto be paid in respect of service rendered by employees in a period and should be recognised as\nexpense in that period when the employees render service.\nB. Pensions\n(a) Defined contribution plans\nFor defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognised as pension expense when\nthey are due on an accrual basis. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent\nof a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments.\n(b) Defined benefit plans\ni. Net obligation under a defined benefit plan is defined as the present value of an amount of\npension benefits that employees will receive on retirement for their services with the Group\nin current period or prior periods. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of\ndefined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the\nbalance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The net defined benefit obligation is\ncalculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The\nrate used to discount is determined by using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds\nthat are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms\nto maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability; when there is no\ndeep market in high-quality corporate bonds, the Group uses interest rates of government\nbonds (at the balance sheet date) instead.\n~22~\nN\nN\nN\nE\n(\nC\nC\ne t c a s h ( u s e d in ) p r o v id e d b y\no p e r a t in g a c t iv it ie se\nt c a s h p r o v id e d b y in v e s t in g\na c t iv it ie se\nt c a s h p r o v id e d b y f in a n c in g\na c t iv it ie s\nf f e c t o f e x c h a n g e r a t e s o n c a s\nc a s h e q u iv a le n t s\nD e c r e a s e ) in c r e a s e in c a s h a n d\ne q u iv a le n t s\na s h a n d c a s h e q u iv a le n t s ,\nb e g in n in g o f p e r io d\na s h a n d c a s h e q u iv a le n t s ,\ne n d o f p e r io d\nh\nc\na n\na s h\nd\n(\n(\nT\n$\n$\nh r e e - m o n t h p e r io\nM a r c h 3 1 , 2 0\n2 0 ,\n1 ,\n1 3 ,\n2 ,\n2 ,\n6 1 ,\n5 8 ,\nd\n2\n5\n6\n4\n4\n9\n7\n7\n4\n6\n9\n4\n6\n6\n0\n3\ne\n9\n6\n2\n7\n2\n1\n8\nn\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nd\n9\n8\n5\n7\n8\n4\n6\ne\n5\n0\n4\n4\n5\n7\n1\nE\nd\n5\n8\n2\n9\n6\n4\n8\nG\n)\n)\nH\nT\n$\n(\n$\nh r e e - m o n t h p e r io\nM a r c h 3 1 , 2 0\n2 ,\n1 ,\n2 ,\n6 ,\n4 7 ,\n5 3 ,\nd\n2\n9\n5\n3\n3\n5\n0\n5\n3\n5\n6\n4\n6\n1\n7\n8\ne\n9\n4\n9\n2\n0\n4\n4\nn\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nd\n2\n7\n1\n8\n2\n1\n3\ne\n3\n2\n2\n5\n2\n1\n3\nd\n5\n1\n2\n5\n3\n2\n5\n)\nii. Remeasurements arising on defined benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive\nincome in the period in which they arise and are recorded as retained earnings.\niii. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\niv. Pension cost for the interim period is calculated on a year-to-date basis by using the\npension cost rate derived from the actuarial valuation at the end of the prior financial year,\nadjusted for significant market fluctuations since that time and for significant curtailments,\nsettlements, or other significant one-off events. Also, the related information is disclosed\naccordingly.\nC. Termination benefits\nTermination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of\nemployment as a result from either the Group’s decision to terminate an employee’s employment\nbefore the normal retirement date, or an employee’s decision to accept an offer of redundancy\nbenefits in exchange for the termination of employment. The Group recognises expense as it can\nno longer withdraw an offer of termination benefits or it recognises relating restructuring costs,\nwhichever is earlier. Benefits that are expected to be due more than 12 months after balance sheet\ndate shall be discounted to their present value.\nD. Employees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration\nEmployees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration are recognised as expense and liability,\nprovided that such recognition is required under legal or constructive obligation and those\namounts can be reliably estimated. Any difference between the resolved amounts and the\nsubsequently actual distributed amounts is accounted for as changes in estimates. If employee\ncompensation is paid by shares, the Group calculates the number of shares based on the closing\nprice at the previous day of the board meeting resolution.\n(5) Income tax\nA. The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or\nloss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or\nitems recognised directly in equity, in which cases the tax is recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or equity.\nB. The current income tax expense is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively\nenacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate\nand generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns\nwith respect to situations in accordance with applicable tax regulations. It establishes provisions\nwhere appropriate based on the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. An additional\ntax is levied on the unappropriated retained earnings and is recorded as income tax expense in\nthe year the stockholders resolve to retain the earnings.\n~23~\nC. Deferred income tax is recognised, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary\ndifferences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in\nthe consolidated balance sheet. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising\non investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the\ntemporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference\nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and\nlaws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected\nto apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability\nis settled.\nD. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit\nwill be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. At each balance sheet\ndate, unrecognised and recognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed.\nE. Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance\nsheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an\nintention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset on the balance sheet when the entity has the\nlegally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and they are\nlevied by the same taxation authority on either the same entity or different entities that intend to\nsettle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nF. A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carryforward of unused tax credits resulting from\nequity investments to the extent that it is possible that future taxable profit will be available\nagainst which the unused tax credits can be utilised.\nG. The interim period income tax expense is recognised based on the estimated average annual\neffective income tax rate expected for the full financial year applied to the pretax income of the\ninterim period, and the related information is disclosed accordingly.\nH. If a change in tax rate is enacted or substantively enacted in an interim period, the Group\nrecognises the effect of the change immediately in the interim period in which the change occurs.\nThe effect of the change on items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised in other\ncomprehensive income or equity while the effect of the change on items recognised in profit or\nloss is recognised in profit or loss.\n5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND KEY SOURCES OF\nASSUMPTION UNCERTAINTY\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical\njudgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies and make critical assumptions and estimates\nconcerning future events. Assumptions and estimates may differ from the actual results and are\ncontinually evaluated and adjusted based on historical experience and other factors. Such assumptions\nand estimates have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities within the next financial year; and the related information is addressed below:\n~24~\n(1) Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies\nLease term\nIn determining the lease term, the Group takes into consideration all facts and circumstances that\ncreate an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not to exercise a termination option,\nincluding the expected changes of all fact and situation for the period from the commencement date\nof lease to the execution date of options. Also, the Group took into consideration the main factors,\nsuch as the contract terms and conditions during the option covered period and the importance to\nlessee’s operation if the significant lease improvement and underlying assets incurred during the\ncontract terms. When significant events or significant changes occur within the Group’s control, the\nlease term will be re-estimated.\n(2) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions\nRevenue recognition\nThe Group primarily engages in global container shipping service covering ocean-going and near-sea\nshipping line. Despite the Group conducting business worldwide, its transactions are all in small\namounts, whereas the freight rate is subject to fluctuation caused by cargo loading rate as well as\nmarket competition. Worldwide shipping agencies use a system to record the transactions by entering\ndata including shipping departure, destination, counterparty, transit time, shipping amounts, and\nfreight price for the Group. Therefore, the Group could recognise freight revenue in accordance with\nthe data on bill of lading reports generated from the system, accompanied by estimation made from\npast experience and current cargo loading conditions the revenue that would flow in. Since ocean-\ngoing shipping often lasts for several days, voyages are sometimes completed after the balance sheet\ndate. Also, demands for freight are consistently sent by forwarders during voyage. Due to the factors\nmentioned above, freight revenue is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method for each\nvessel during the reporting period. As the estimation of freight revenue are subject to management’s\njudgement, therefore freight revenue involves high uncertainty. Given the conditions mentioned\nabove, this may result in adjustments to the estimation amounts.\n6.

The fair value of the Group’s associates which have quoted market price was as follows:\nF. On June 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to dispose the Company’s\nequity interest in EVA through stock exchange market, and the number of shares and the amounts\nsettled on August 14, 2023 and August 21, 2023 totalled 375,402 thousand shares and $13,046,838,\nrespectively, resulting in an aggregate gain of disposal of $6,260,209. After the disposal and due\nto the conversion of EVA’s convertible bonds into stocks from January 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024,\nthe Company’s share interest in EVA decreased to 7.43% as of March 31, 2024.\nG. On November 4, 2022, the Board of Directors of the subsidiary, EMA, resolved to acquire 9%,\n40% and 51% of the equity interest in CCT from its original shareholders, EGH, Clove and Ally,\nrespectively, for a transaction price of USD 268,000, and obtained the control over CCT.

The amount was transferred to the investment\ntransaction account in December 2023 and had acquired approval and registered transfer on\nJanuary 8, 2024 and transferred to investments accounted for using equity method.\nI. On March 20, 2024, the Board of Directors of Balsam Investment (Netherlands) N.V. resolved the\ncapital reduction and the proceeds from capital reduction amounted to USD 435,861. The\nsubsidiary, Peony, acquired $6,696,269 (approx. USD 213,572) in proportion to its ownership\nfrom the capital reduction.\nJ. The Company is the single largest shareholder of EITC with a 40.36% equity interest. Given that\nthe main source of economic profits of EITC’s related party transactions is generated from\nEvergreen Line, and there is no agreement between the Group and other related parties of\nEvergreen Line to make decisions in consultation or collectively; however, in order to maintain\nthe equity balance between the Group and other related parties, the Company governs EITC with\nother related parties to maintain mutual and other shareholders’ best interests; apart from\nindependent directors, the number of seats held by the Company on the Board are the same as\nother related parties’, which indicates that the Company has no current ability to direct the relevant\nactivities of EITC, thus, the Company has no control, but only has significant influence, over the\ninvestee.\n~34~\nE\nE\nE\nv\na\nV\nv\ne r\nn d\nA\ne r\ng r\nT\nA\ng r\ne e\nr a\nir\ne e\nn\nn\nw\nn\nI n t\ns p o\na y s\nS t e\ne r n a\nr t C\nC o\ne l C\nt io n a l S\no r p o r a t\nr p o r a t io\no r p .\nt\nio\nn\no\nn\nr a g e $\n$\nM a r c h 3\n1 3\n1 2\n9\n3 6\n1\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n5\n8\n8\n1\n2\n0\n1\n6\n8\n0\n2\n6\n6\n4\n2\n, 2\n, 3\n, 3\n, 9\n4\n0\n9\n7\n7\n0\n5\n6\n1\nD\n$\n$\ne c e m b e r\n1 3\n1 2\n8\n3 4\n3\n, 6\n, 6\n, 2\n, 5\n1\n5\n1\n4\n1\n,\n2\n5\n1\n0\n2\n,\n,\n,\n,\n0\n9\n8\n7\n5\n2\n4\n2\n9\n5\n3\n2\n5\n2\n9\n$\n$\nM a r c h 3\n1 1\n2 0\n4\n3 7\n1\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n9\n8\n4\n2\n2\n3\n5\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n2\n2\n, 1\n, 1\n, 0\n, 3\n3\n7\n2\n3\n4\n4\n9\n8\n1\nK. The Company is the single largest shareholder of TPCT with a 33.68% equity interest. Given that\nthe other two large shareholders (non-related parties) also operate transportation business and hold\nmore shares than the Company, and there is no agreement between the shareholders to make\ndecisions in consultation or collectively as they make decisions independently, which indicates\nthat the Company has no current ability to direct the relevant decisions of TPCT, thus, the\nCompany has no control, but only has significant influence, over the investee.\nL.

The Group’s businesses involve some non-functional currency operations (the Company’s\nand certain subsidiaries’ functional currency: NTD; other certain subsidiaries’ functional\ncurrency: USD, EUR, CNY and others).

The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the\nGroup and classified on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income. The Group is not exposed to significant commodity price risk. To\nmanage its price risk arising from investments in equity securities, the Group diversifies its\nportfolio. Diversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the\nGroup.\nii. The Group’s investments in equity securities comprise domestic listed and unlisted stocks.\nThe prices of equity securities would change due to the change of the future value of\ninvestee companies. If the prices of these equity securities had increased/decreased by 1%\nwith all other variables held constant, equity would have increased/decreased by $26,151\nand $14,806 for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as\na result of other comprehensive income classified as equity investment at fair value through\nother comprehensive income.\nCash flow and fair value interest rate risk\ni. The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at\nvariable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by\ncash and cash equivalents held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose\nthe Group to fair value interest rate risk. During the three-month periods ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023, the Group’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in the NTD and\nUSD.\n~82~\n(\nF\nF\nF o r\nin a\nM\nU\nG\nin a\nM o\nU\nC\nE\nH\nG\ne\nn\noSB\nn\nnSNUKB\nig n c u r r e n\nc ia l a s s e t s\nn e t a r y it e mD\n: N T DP\n: U S D\nc ia l lia b ilit\ne t a r y it e mD\n: N T DY\n: U S D\nR : U S D\nD : U S D\nP : U S D\nc y\ns\nie\ns\n:\ns\nf u n c t io n a l c u r r e n c y )\nT\nD\nv\nh\ne\na\nr e e - m\ng r e e\nr ia t io\n1 %1\n%\n1 %1\n%1\n%1\n%1\n%\no\no\nn\nn\nf\nt h\nS\np e r io d e n d e\ne n s it iv it y a n\nE f f e c t o n\np r o f it o r lo\n$ 5 2 6 , 7 5\n1 , 9 8\n$ 3 6 3 , 7 5\n1 4 , 0 1\n1 , 7 7\n4 , 0 1\n1 , 9 5\nd\na\ns\n39\n89076\nM\nly\ns\ns\na r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 3\nis\nE f f e c t o n o t h e r\nc o m p r e h e n s iv e\nin c o m e\n$ 6 5 , 9 8 5\n-\n$ 1 6 3 , 1 6 2\n-\n-\n-\n-\nii.

Credit risk refers to the risk of financial loss to the Group arising from default by the clients\nor counterparties of financial instruments on the contract obligations. The main factor is\nthat counterparties could not repay in full the notes receivable, accounts receivable, contract\nassets and financial assets at amortised cost based on the agreed terms.\nii. The Group manages their credit risk taking into consideration the entire group’s concern.\nAccording to the Group’s credit policy, each local entity in the Group is responsible for\nmanaging and analysing the credit risk for each of their clients before standard payment and\ndelivery terms and conditions are offered. Internal risk control assesses the credit quality of\nthe customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.\niii. The Group manages their credit risk taking into consideration the entire group’s concern.\nFor banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with good credit rating\nare accepted.\niv. The Group adopts following assumptions under IFRS 9 to assess whether there has been a\nsignificant increase in credit risk on that instrument since initial recognition:\nIf the contract payments were past due over 30 days based on the terms, there has been a\nsignificant increase in credit risk on that instrument since initial recognition.\nv. The default occurs when the contract payments are past due over 30 days.\nvi. The following indicators are used to determine whether the credit impairment of debt\ninstruments has occurred:\n(i) It becomes probable that the issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation\ndue to their financial difficulties;\n(ii) The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial\ndifficulties;\n(iii) Default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments;\n(iv) Adverse changes in national or regional economic conditions that are expected to cause\na default.\nvii. The Group classifies customers’ accounts receivable and contract assets in accordance with\ngeographic area. The Group applies the modified approach based on the loss rate\nmethodology to estimate expected credit loss.\n~83~\nviii. The Group wrote-off the financial assets, which cannot be reasonably expected to be\nrecovered, after initiating recourse procedures. However, the Group will continue executing\nthe recourse procedures to secure their rights. As of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023\nand March 31, 2023, the Group has no written-off financial assets that are still under\nrecourse procedures.\nix. The Group used the forecastability to adjust historical, timely information, economic\nconditions of the industry, GDP forecast and trade growth rate to assess the default\npossibility of notes receivable, accounts receivable (including related parties) and contract\nassets. As of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, the loss rate\nmethodology is as follows:\n~84~\nM\nN\nM\nN\nU\n3\nM\nN\nD\nN\nD\nN\nU\n3\nD\nN\na r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2\no t p a s t d u e\na r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2\no t p a s t d u e\np t o 3 0 d a y s\n1 t o 1 8 0 d a y s\na r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2\no t p a s t d u e\ne c e m b e r 3 1 ,\no t p a s t d u e\ne c e m b e r 3 1 ,\no t p a s t d u e\np t o 3 0 d a y s\n1 t o 1 8 0 d a y s\ne c e m b e r 3 1 ,\no t p a s t d u e\n4\n4\n4\n2\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\nN o t e s r e c e iv a b le\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 1 6 2\nA c c o u n t s r e c e iv a b\n( in c lu d in g r e la t e d p a r\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 2 1 , 7 3 3\n3 , 8 7 3\n2 8 7\n$ 2 5 , 8 9 4\nC o n t r a c t a s s e t s\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 2 , 7 8 4\nN o t e s r e c e iv a b le\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 7 4\nA c c o u n t s r e c e iv a b\n( in c lu d in g r e la t e d p a r\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 1 7 , 1 6 8\n3 , 2 3 8\n2 3 4\n$ 2 0 , 6 4 0\nC o n t r a c t a s s e t s\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 1 , 4 3 8\n, 1\nle\nt ie\n, 6\n, 6\n, 5\n, 8\n, 1\n, 0\nle\nt ie\n, 1\n, 2\n, 4\n, 7\n, 4\n5\ns\n0\n7\n6\n4\n4\n2\ns\n2\n6\n0\n9\n2\n2\n)\n0\n5\n6\n1\n2\n0\n)\n7\n5\n7\n9\n4\nE\n0\nE\n0\n0\n0\nE\n0\nE\n0\nE\n0\n0\n0\nE\n0\nx\n. 0\nx\n. 0\n. 0\n. 0\nx\n. 0\nx\n. 0\nx\n. 0\n. 0\n. 0\nx\n. 0\np\n0\np\n0\n0\n0\np\n0\np\n0\np\n0\n1\n0\np\n5\ne\n0\ne\n0\n9\n1\ne\n0\ne\n0\ne\n0\n0\n1\ne\n0\nc\n0\nc\n0\n8\n7\nc\n0\nc\n0\nc\n0\n0\n7\nc\n8\nt e\n%\nt e\n%\n%\n%\nt e\n%\nt e\n%\nt e\n%\n%\n%\nt e\n%\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\nlo\n0\nlo\n0\n0\n1\nlo\n0\nlo\n0\nlo\n0\n0\n0\nlo\n0\ns\n. 5\ns\n. 5\n. 1\n. 1\ns\n. 1\ns\n. 5\ns\n. 4\n. 1\n. 5\ns\n. 0\ns\n4\ns\n0\n6\n3\ns\n6\ns\n0\ns\n9\n3\n9\ns\n5\nr\n1\nr\n7\n0\n8\nr\n0\nr\n0\nr\n2\n9\n8\nr\n4\na t\n4\na t\n1\n1\n8\na t\n1\na t\n0\na t\n5\n2\n7\na t\n7\ne\n%\ne\n%\n%\n%\ne\n%\ne\n%\ne\n%\n%\n%\ne\n%\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nL o s s a llo w a\nL o s s a llo w a\n2 8\n6\n2\n3 7\nL o s s a llo w a\n3\nL o s s a llo w a\nL o s s a llo w a\n1 0\n2\n1\n1 5\nL o s s a llo w a\nn c\n1\nn c\n, 5 3\n, 3 4\n, 2 3\n, 1 1\nn c\n, 5 3\nn c\n1\nn c\n, 8 3\n, 6 5\n, 5 2\n, 0 1\nn c\n8 3\ne\n7\ne\n0\n4\n8\n2\ne\n5\ne\n7\ne\n2\n5\n9\n6\ne\n9\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nNotes receivable\nMarch 31, 2023 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 82,831 0.0001%~0.8105% $ 19\nAccounts receivable\n(including related parties)\nMarch 31, 2023 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 1 8,795,770 0.0000%~0.6242% $ 7,333\nUp to 30 days 2,323,959 0.0100%~0.3431% 2,231\n31 to 180 days 774,143 0.0150%~1.8676% 3,135\n$ 2 1,893,872 $ 12,699\nContract assets\nMarch 31, 2023 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 1,112,691 0.0001%~0.3431% $ 490\nx.

The different levels that the inputs to valuation techniques are used to measure fair value of\nfinancial and non-financial instruments have been defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the\nentity can access at the measurement date. A market is regarded as active if it meets all\nthe following conditions: the items traded in the market are homogeneous; willing\nbuyers and sellers can normally be found at any time; and prices are available to the\npublic.

The instruments the Group used market quoted prices as their fair values (that is, Level 1)\nare listed below by characteristics:\nii. Except for financial instruments with active markets, the fair value of other financial\ninstruments is measured by using valuation techniques or by reference to counterparty\nquotes. The fair value of financial instruments measured by using valuation techniques can\nbe referred to current fair value of instruments with similar terms and characteristics in\nsubstance, discounted cash flow method or other valuation methods, including calculated\nby applying model using market information available at the consolidated balance sheet\ndate (i.e. yield curves on the Taipei Exchange, average commercial paper interest rates\nquoted from Reuters).\niii. When assessing non-standard and low-complexity financial instruments, the Group adopts\nvaluation technique that is widely used by market participants. The inputs used in the\nvaluation method to measure these financial instruments are normally observable in the\nmarket.\niv. The valuation of derivative financial instruments is based on valuation model widely\naccepted by market participants, such as present value techniques and option pricing\nmodels. Forward exchange contracts are usually valued based on the current forward\nexchange rate. Structured interest derivative instruments are measured by using appropriate\noption pricing models (i.e. Black-Scholes model) or other valuation methods, such as\nMonte Carlo simulation.\n~90~\nM a r k e t q u o t e d p r ic e\nL\nC\nis\nlo\nt e\ns\nd\nin\ns\ng\nh\np\na\nr\nr e\nic\ns\ne\nO\nN\np\ne\ne n\nt a\n-\ns\ne\ns\nn\ne\nd\nt v\nf u\na\nn\nlu\nd\ne\nv. The output of valuation model is an estimated value and the valuation technique may not\nbe able to capture all relevant factors of the Group’s financial and non-financial instruments.\nTherefore, the estimated value derived using valuation model is adjusted accordingly with\nadditional inputs, for example, model risk or liquidity risk and etc. In accordance with the\nGroup’s management policies and relevant control procedures relating to the valuation\nmodels used for fair value measurement, management believes adjustment to valuation is\nnecessary in order to reasonably represent the fair value of financial and non-financial\ninstruments at the consolidated balance sheet. The inputs and pricing information used\nduring valuation are carefully assessed and adjusted based on current market conditions.\nvi. The Group takes into account adjustments for credit risks to measure the fair value of\nfinancial and non-financial instruments to reflect credit risk of the counterparty and the\nGroup’s credit quality.\nE. For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no transfer between Level\n1 and Level 2.\nF. The following chart is the movement of Level 3 for the three-month periods ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023:\nNote: Recorded as unrealised gains or losses on valuation of investments in equity instruments\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income and exchange differences on\ntranslating the financial statements of foreign operations.\nG. For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no transfer into or out\nfrom Level 3.\nH. The Group is in charge of valuation procedures for fair value measurements being categorised\nwithin Level 3, which is to verify independent fair value of financial instruments. Such\nassessment is to ensure the valuation results are reasonable by applying independent information\nto make results close to current market conditions, confirming the resource of information is\nindependent, reliable and in line with other resources and represented as the exercisable price,\nand frequently calibrating valuation model, performing back-testing, updating inputs used to the\nvaluation model and making any other necessary adjustments to the fair value.\n~91~\nA\nG\nA\nt J a n\na in s\nc o m p\nt M a\nu a\na n\nr e\nr c\nr\nd\nh\nh\ny 1\nlo\ne n\n3 1\ns\ns\ns e\niv\ns\ne\nr e\nin\nc\nc\no\no\ng\nm\nn\ne\nis\n(\ne\nN\nd\no\nin\nt e\no\n)\nt h e r\n$\n$\n2 0 2 4\n9\n7\n1 , 6\n0\n6\n6\n1\n7\n8\n,\n,\n,\n3\n3\n7\n6\n7\n4\n6\n6\n2\n(\n$\n$\n2 0 2 3\n7\n7\n3\n2\n0\n3\n6\n6\n,\n,\n,\n7\n9\n7\n6\n6\n9\n5\n9\n6\n)\nI.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT\nMARCH 31, 2023 AND 2022\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor the convenience of readers and for information purpose only, the auditors’ report and the accompanying\nfinancial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in\nthe Republic of China. In the event of any discrepancy between the English version and the original Chinese\nversion or any differences in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language auditors’ report and\nfinancial statements shall prevail.\n~1~\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT TRANSLATED FROM CHINESE\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Evergreen Marine Corporation (Taiwan) Ltd.\nIntroduction\nWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evergreen Marine Corporation\n(Taiwan) Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred herin as the “Group”) as of\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of changes\nin equity and of cash flows for the three-month periods then ended, and notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. Management is responsible\nfor the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with\nthe Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and International\nAccounting Standard 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” that came into effect as endorsed by the\nFinancial Supervisory Commission. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our reviews.\nScope of Review\nExcept as explained in the following paragraph, we conducted our reviews in accordance with the\nStandard on Review Engagements 2410 , \"Review of Financial Information Performed by the\nIndependent Auditor of the Entity\" of the Republic of China. A review of consolidated financial\nstatements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting\nmatters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than\nan audit and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all\nsignificant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\n~2~\nBasis for qualified conclusion\nAs explained in Note 6(8), we did not review the financial statements of certain investments accounted\nfor using equity method, which statements reflect investments accounted for using equity method of\nNT$3,566,896 thousand and NT$3,054,919 thousand, constituting 0.40% and 0.40% of the consolidated\ntotal assets as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and comprehensive income and loss under the\nequity method of NT$95,173 thousand, NT$93,291 thousand, constituting 3.64% and 0.08% of the\nconsolidated total comprehensive income and loss for the three-month periods then ended. These\namounts and the related information disclosed in Note 13 were based on the unreviewed financial\nstatements of such investee companies.\nQualified conclusion\nBased on our reviews and the reports of other independent auditors (please refer to other matter), except\nfor the possible effects on the consolidated financial statements, if any, as might have been determined\nto be necessary had the financial statements of certain investments accounted for using equity method\nand the related information disclosed in Note 13 been reviewed by independent auditors as explained in\nthe preceding paragraph, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the\nconsolidated financial position of the Group as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, and its consolidated\nfinancial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the three-month periods then ended in\naccordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers\nand International Accounting Standard 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” that came into effect as\nendorsed by the Financial Supervisory Commission.\n~3~\nOther matter – Review reports of other independent auditors\nWe did not review the financial statements of certain consolidated subsidiaries and investments\naccounted for using equity method. Those financial statements were reviewed by other independent\nauditors, whose reports thereon have been furnished to us, and our report expressed herein, insofar as it\nrelates to the amounts included in the financial statements and the information disclosed in Note 13 was\nbased solely on the review reports of other independent auditors. These statements reflect total assets\nincluding investments accounted for using equity method of NT$89,067,642 thousand and\nNT$78,511,302 thousand, constituting 9.99% and 10.36% of the consolidated total assets as of March\n31, 2023 and 2022, and total operating revenues of NT$764,507 thousand and NT$563,197 thousand,\nconstituting 1.14% and 0.33%, of the consolidated total operating revenues for the three-month periods\nthen ended. The comprehensive income and loss under equity method was NT$1,041,840 thousand and\nNT$2,004,825 thousand, constituting 39.86% and 1.74% of the consolidated total comprehensive\nincome and loss for the three-month periods then ended.\nLai, Chung-Hsi\nChou, Hsiao-Tzu\nFor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Taiwan\nMay 12, 2023\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are not intended to present the financial position and results of\noperations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in countries and jurisdictions other\nthan the Republic of China. The standards, procedures and practices in the Republic of China governing the audit of such\nfinancial statements may differ from those generally accepted in countries and jurisdictions other than the Republic of China.\nAccordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and independent auditors’ review report are not intended\nfor use by those who are not informed about the accounting principles or auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic\nof China, and their applications in practice.\nAs the financial statements are the responsibility of the management, PricewaterhouseCoopers cannot accept any liability for\nthe use of, or reliance on, the English translation or for any errors or misunderstandings that may derive from the translation.\n~4~\nEVERGREEN MARINE CORPORATION (TAIWAN) LTD.

Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent\nof a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments.\n(b) Defined benefit plans\ni. Net obligation under a defined benefit plan is defined as the present value of an amount of\npension benefits that employees will receive on retirement for their services with the Group\nin current period or prior periods. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of\ndefined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the\nbalance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The net defined benefit obligation is\ncalculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The\nrate used to discount is determined by using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds\nthat are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms\nto maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability; when there is no\ndeep market in high-quality corporate bonds, the Group uses interest rates of government\nbonds (at the balance sheet date) instead.\nii. Remeasurements arising on defined benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive\nincome in the period in which they arise and are recorded as retained earnings.\niii. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\niv. Pension cost for the interim period is calculated on a year-to-date basis by using the\npension cost rate derived from the actuarial valuation at the end of the prior financial year,\nadjusted for significant market fluctuations since that time and for significant curtailments,\nsettlements, or other significant one-off events. Also, the related information is disclosed\naccordingly.\nC. Termination benefits\nTermination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of\nemployment as a result from either the Group’s decision to terminate an employee’s employment\nbefore the normal retirement date, or an employee’s decision to accept an offer of redundancy\nbenefits in exchange for the termination of employment. The Group recognises expense as it can\nno longer withdraw an offer of termination benefits or it recognises relating restructuring costs,\nwhichever is earlier. Benefits that are expected to be due more than 12 months after balance sheet\ndate shall be discounted to their present value.\nD. Employees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration\nEmployees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration are recognised as expense and liability,\nprovided that such recognition is required under legal or constructive obligation and those\namounts can be reliably estimated. Any difference between the resolved amounts and the\nsubsequently actual distributed amounts is accounted for as changes in estimates. If employee\ncompensation is paid by shares, the Group calculates the number of shares based on the closing\nprice at the previous day of the board meeting resolution.\n~22~\n(5) Income tax\nA. The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or\nloss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or\nitems recognised directly in equity, in which cases the tax is recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or equity.\nB. The current income tax expense is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively\nenacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate\nand generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns\nwith respect to situations in accordance with applicable tax regulations. It establishes provisions\nwhere appropriate based on the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. An additional\ntax is levied on the unappropriated retained earnings and is recorded as income tax expense in\nthe year the stockholders resolve to retain the earnings.\nC. Deferred income tax is recognised, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary\ndifferences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in\nthe consolidated balance sheet. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising\non investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the\ntemporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference\nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and\nlaws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected\nto apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability\nis settled.\nD. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit\nwill be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. At each balance sheet\ndate, unrecognised and recognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed.\nE. Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance\nsheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an\nintention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset on the balance sheet when the entity has the\nlegally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and they are\nlevied by the same taxation authority on either the same entity or different entities that intend to\nsettle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nF. A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carryforward of unused tax credits resulting from\nequity investments to the extent that it is possible that future taxable profit will be available\nagainst which the unused tax credits can be utilised.\nG. The interim period income tax expense is recognised based on the estimated average annual\neffective income tax rate expected for the full financial year applied to the pretax income of the\ninterim period, and the related information is disclosed accordingly.\nH. If a change in tax rate is enacted or substantively enacted in an interim period, the Group\n~23~\nrecognises the effect of the change immediately in the interim period in which the change occurs.\nThe effect of the change on items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised in other\ncomprehensive income or equity while the effect of the change on items recognised in profit or\nloss is recognised in profit or loss.\n5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND KEY SOURCES OF\nASSUMPTION UNCERTAINTY\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical\njudgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies and make critical assumptions and estimates\nconcerning future events. Assumptions and estimates may differ from the actual results and are\ncontinually evaluated and adjusted based on historical experience and other factors. Such assumptions\nand estimates have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities within the next financial year; and the related information is addressed below:\n(1) Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies\nLease term\nIn determining the lease term, the Group takes into consideration all facts and circumstances that\ncreate an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not to exercise a termination option,\nincluding the expected changes of all fact and situation for the period from the commencement date\nof lease to the execution date of options. Also, the Group took into consideration the main factors,\nsuch as the contract terms and conditions during the option covered period and the importance to\nlessee’s operation if the significant lease improvement and underlying assets incurred during the\ncontract terms. When significant events or significant changes occur within the Group’s control, the\nlease term will be re-estimated.\n(2) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions\nRevenue recognition\nThe Group primarily engages in global container shipping service covering ocean-going and near-sea\nshipping line. Despite the Group conducting business worldwide, its transactions are all in small\namounts, whereas the freight rate is subject to fluctuation caused by cargo loading rate as well as\nmarket competition. Worldwide shipping agencies use a system to record the transactions by entering\ndata including shipping departure, destination, counterparty, transit time, shipping amounts, and\nfreight price for the Group. Therefore, the Group could recognise freight revenue in accordance with\nthe data on bill of lading reports generated from the system, accompanied by estimation made from\npast experience and current cargo loading conditions the revenue that would flow in. Since ocean-\ngoing shipping often lasts for several days, voyages are sometimes completed after the balance sheet\ndate. Also, demands for freight are consistently sent by forwarders during voyage. Due to the factors\nmentioned above, freight revenue is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method for each\nvessel during the reporting period. As the estimation of freight revenue are subject to management’s\njudgement, therefore freight revenue involves high uncertainty. Given the conditions mentioned\nabove, this may result in adjustments to the estimation amounts.\n~24~\n6. DETAILS OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTS\n(1) Cash and cash equivalents\nA. The Group transacts with a variety of financial institutions all with high credit quality to disperse\ncredit risk, so it expects that the probability of counterparty default is remote.\nB. The Group has no cash and cash equivalents pledged to others.\n(2) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\nA. The Group has elected to classify these investments that are considered to be strategic investments\nas financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. The fair value of such\ninvestments amounted to $1,589,433, $1,581,495 and $2,264,720 as at March 31, 2023, December\n31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.\nB.

Moreover, the effective\nportion with respect to the changes in the hedging instruments caused by exchange rate risk is deferred\nto recognise in gains (loss) on hedging instruments, which is under other equity interest, and will be\nreclassified to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment when the hedged items are occurred.\n~26~\nC\nN\nI t e m\nu r r e n t it e m s :\nT im e d e p o s it s e x c\nR e s t r ic t e d r e s e r v e\nF in a n c ia l b o n d s\nP le d g e d t im e d e p o\no n - c u r r e n t it e m s :\nF in a n c ia l b o n d s\nP le d g e d t im e d e p o\nT im e d e p o s it s e x c\nI n t e r e s t in c o m e\ns\ne e d\na c c\ns it s\ns it s\ne e d\nino\nin\ngu\ng\nn\n3t\n1\nm\ny e\no\na\nn\nr\nt h s $\n$\n$\n$\nM a r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 3\n2 8 , 3 2 6 , 8 4 9\n4 2 1 , 9 3 5\n-\n-\n2 8 , 7 4 8 , 7 8 4\n5 0 , 0 0 0\n3 0 1 , 4 7 9\n1 9 0 , 6 7 6\n5 4 2 , 1 5 5\nT h r e e - m o n t h p\nM a r c h 3 1\n$\nD e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 2\n$ 4 2 , 4 7 9 , 7 6 3\n4 8 5 , 7 7 3\n-\n-\n$ 4 2 , 9 6 5 , 5 3 6\n$ 5 0 , 0 0 0\n3 0 3 , 4 0 8\n1 5 6 , 2 5 9\n$ 5 0 9 , 6 6 7\ne r io d e n d e d T h r e e - m\n, 2 0 2 3 M\n4 8 3 , 6 0 5 $\nM a r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 2\n$ 1 0 0 , 4 0 2 , 8 0 3\n2 , 4 7 3 , 4 5 9\n5 0 , 0 0 0\n9 , 0 0 1\n$ 1 0 2 , 9 3 5 , 2 6 3\n$ 5 0 , 0 0 0\n2 8 4 , 1 4 6\n2 3 8 , 9 0 7\n$ 5 7 3 , 0 5 3\no n t h p e r io d e n d e d\na r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 2\n1 1 3 , 6 1 0\nDetails of relevant transactions are as follows:\nMarch 31, 2023\nDesignated as\nHedged items hedging instruments Contract period Book value\nExpected US dollar\nUS dollar denominated\ndenominated 2022.7.27~2024.6.30 $ 6,598,502\nrestricted time deposits\nequipment payable\nDecember 31, 2022\nDesignated as\nHedged items hedging instruments Contract period Book value\nExpected US dollar\nUS dollar denominated\ndenominated 2022.7.27~2024.6.30 $ 8,461,308\nrestricted time deposits\nequipment payable\nMarch 31, 2022\nDesignated as\nHedged items hedging instruments Contract period Book value\nExpected US dollar\nUS dollar denominated\ndenominated 2021.7.27~2023.4.30 $ 16,331,353\nrestricted time deposits\nequipment payable\nA.

The Company is the single largest shareholder of EITC with a 40.36% equity interest. Given that\nthe main source of economic profits of EITC is generated from Evergreen Line, the percentage of\noperating volume of the Group in Evergreen Line is equivalent to other related parties’ and there\nis no agreement between other related parties and the Company to make decisions in consultation\nor collectively; however, in order to maintain the equity balance between the Group and other\nrelated parties, the Company governs EITC with other related parties to maintain mutual and other\nshareholders’ best interests; apart from independent directors, the number of seats held by the\nCompany on the Board are the same as other related parties’, which indicates that the Group has\nno current ability to direct the relevant activities of EITC, thus, the Group has no control, but only\nhas significant influence, over the investee.\nJ. The Company is the single largest shareholder of EVA with a 14.48% equity interest. Given that\nthe other top ten large shareholders (including other related parties and non-related parties) hold\nmore shares than the Company, and there is no agreement between the shareholders to make\ndecisions in consultation or collectively as they make decisions independently, which indicates\nthat the Company has no current ability to direct the relevant decisions of EVA, thus, the Company\nhas no control, but only has significant influence, over the investee.\nK. The Company is the single largest shareholder of TPCT with a 27.85% equity interest. Given that\nthe other two large shareholders (non-related parties) also operate transportation business and hold\nmore shares than the Company, and there is no agreement between the shareholders to make\ndecisions in consultation or collectively as they make decisions independently, which indicates\nthat the Company has no current ability to direct the relevant decisions of TPCT, thus, the\nCompany has no control, but only has significant influence, over the investee.\nL. The Company is the single largest shareholder of EGST with a 19.00% equity interest.

The reference price refers to the closing price of the Company’s common\nstocks on the Taiwan Stock Exchange on a prior trading day of the pricing date, which was\nNT$85 (in dollars).\ni.

The Company may redeem the Fourth Convertible Bonds, in whole, at the early redemption\namount if the closing price of the Company’s common shares is above than the conversion\nprice by 30% for 30 consecutive trading days during the period from the date after 3 months\nof the bonds issue to 40 days before the maturity date.\nii. The Company may redeem the Fourth Convertible Bonds, in whole, at the early\nredemption amount if the amount of the Company’s outstanding shares is lower than the\nconversion price by 10% of the original total issuance amount during the period from the\ndate after 3 months of the bonds issue to 40 days before the maturity date.\nD. Regarding the issuance of convertible bonds, the equity conversion options were separated from\nthe liability component in accordance with IAS 32. As of March 31, 2023, the domestic\nunsecured convertible bonds amounting to $288,067 were recognised in ‘capital surplus—share\noptions’. In addition, the call options and redemption embedded in convertible bonds were not\nseparated from their host contracts and were recognised in ‘financial assets or liabilities at fair\nvalue through profit or loss’ in net amount in accordance with IFRS 9 because the economic\ncharacteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives were closely related to those of the host\ncontracts.\n(16) Long-term loans\nThe above loans were borrowed in NTD and USD.

Financial risk management policies\n(a) The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign\nexchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s\noverall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and\nseeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial position and financial\nperformance.\n(b) Risk management is carried out by the Group’s Finance Department under policies approved\nby the Board of Directors. The Group’s Finance Department identifies, evaluates and hedges\nfinancial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s Operating Department. The Board of\nDirectors provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies\ncovering specific areas and matters, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit\nrisk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and\ninvestment of excess liquidity.\nC. Significant financial risks and degrees of financial risks\n(a) Market risk\nForeign exchange risk\ni. The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from\nvarious currency exposures, primarily with respect to the USD, EUR and CNY. Foreign\nexchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities\nand net investment in foreign operations.\nii. The Group’s management has set up a policy to require group companies to manage their\nforeign exchange risk against their functional currency. The group companies are required\nto hedge their entire foreign exchange risk exposure with the Group’s Finance Department.\nTo manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and\nrecognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward foreign exchange\ncontracts, transacted with Group’s Finance Department. Foreign exchange risk arises when\nfuture commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a\nforeign currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.\niii. The Group’s businesses involve some non-functional currency operations (the Company’s\nand certain subsidiaries’ functional currency: NTD; other certain subsidiaries’ functional\ncurrency: USD, EUR, CNY and others). The information on assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies whose values would be materially affected by the\nexchange rate fluctuations is as follows:\n~75~\n~76~\n(\nF\nF\n(\nF\nF\nF o r\nin a\nM o\nU\nG\nin a\nM o\nU\nC\nE\nH\nG\nF o r\nin a\nM o\nU\nE\nG\nin a\nM o\nU\nC\nE\nH\nG\ne\nn\nn\nS\nB\nn\nn\nS\nN\nU\nK\nB\ne\nn\nn\nS\nU\nB\nn\nn\nS\nN\nU\nK\nB\nig n c u r r e n\nc ia l a s s e t s\ne t a r y it e m\nD : N T D\nP : U S D\nc ia l lia b ilit\ne t a r y it e m\nD : N T D\nY : U S D\nR : U S D\nD : U S D\nP : U S D\nig n c u r r e n\nc ia l a s s e t s\ne t a r y it e m\nD : N T D\nR : U S D\nP : U S D\nc ia l lia b ilit\ne t a r y it e m\nD : N T D\nY : U S D\nR : U S D\nD : U S D\nP : U S D\nc y\ns\nie\ns\nc y\ns\nie\ns\n:\ns\n:\ns\nf\nf\nu\nu\nn\nn\nc\nc\nt\nt\nio\nio\nn\nn\na\na\nl\nl\nc\nc\nu\nu\nr\nr\nr\nr\ne\ne\nn\nn\nc\nc\ny\ny\n)\n)\n$\n$\n$\n$\nF o r e ig\nc u r r e n c\na m o u n\n1 , 9 5 2\n5\n1 , 7 3 5\n3 1 7\n5\n1 0 3\n5\nF o r e ig\nc u r r e n c\na m o u n\n1 , 2 8 1\n4\n6\n1 , 5 3 1\n2 9 7\n6\n1 1 3\n7\nn\ny\nt\n, 6\n, 2\n, 8\n, 4\n, 3\n, 8\n, 1\nn\ny\nt\n, 9\n, 4\n, 8\n, 9\n, 9\n, 6\n, 7\n, 3\n8\n8\n6\n1\n4\n6\n9\n9\n4\n3\n1\n4\n4\n5\n6\n7\n3\n0\n8\n2\n7\n5\n5\n5\n4\n4\n8\n3\n3\n2\nD\nM\nE\ne c\nE\na\nx\ne\nx\nr c h 3 1 , 2 0 2\nc h a n g e r a t e\n3 0 . 3 5 5 0\n1 . 2 4 0 1\n3 0 . 3 5 5 0\n0 . 1 4 5 5\n1 . 0 9 1 6\n0 . 1 2 7 4\n1 . 2 4 0 1\nm b e r 3 1 , 2 0\nc h a n g e r a t e\n3 0 . 5 9 5 0\n1 . 0 6 5 8\n1 . 2 0 5 3\n3 0 . 5 9 5 0\n0 . 1 4 3 6\n1 . 0 6 5 8\n0 . 1 2 8 2\n1 . 2 0 5 3\n3\n2\n$\n$\n2\n$\n$\nB o o k\n( N T\n5 9 , 2\n1\n5 2 , 6\n1 , 4\n1\n4\n1\nB o o k\n( N T\n3 9 , 2\n1\n2\n4 6 , 8\n1 , 3\n2\n4\n2\nv\nD\n7\n9\n9\n0\n7\n0\n9\nv\nD\n2\n4\n5\n6\n0\n1\n4\n7\na\n3\n8\n2\n1\n7\n1\n5\na\n2\n4\n2\n8\n9\n6\n6\n1\nlu\n)\n, 8\n, 8\n, 0\n, 9\n, 0\n, 6\n, 5\nlu\n)\n, 6\n, 9\n, 0\n, 9\n, 0\n, 6\n, 1\n, 4\ne\n1\n6\n3\n2\n1\n7\n5\ne\n3\n4\n1\n0\n1\n1\n7\n8\n4\n9\n0\n5\n0\n7\n7\n7\n3\n2\n9\n7\n6\n1\n2\niv.

The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the\nGroup and classified on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income. The Group is not exposed to significant commodity price risk. To\nmanage its price risk arising from investments in equity securities, the Group diversifies its\nportfolio. Diversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the\nGroup.\nii. The Group’s investments in equity securities comprise domestic listed and unlisted stocks.\nThe prices of equity securities would change due to the change of the future value of\ninvestee companies. If the prices of these equity securities had increased/decreased by 1%\nwith all other variables held constant, equity would have increased/decreased by $14,806\nand $22,346 for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as\na result of other comprehensive income classified as equity investment at fair value through\nother comprehensive income.\nCash flow and fair value interest rate risk\ni. The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at\nvariable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by\ncash and cash equivalents held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose\nthe Group to fair value interest rate risk. During the three-month periods ended March 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Group’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in the NTD and\nUSD.\n~78~\n(\nF\nF\nF o r\nin a\nM\nU\nE\nC\nE\nG\nin a\nM o\nU\nC\nH\nG\ne\nn\noSUHUB\nn\nnSNKB\nig n c u r r e n\nc ia l a s s e t s\nn e t a r y it e mD\n: N T DR\n: N T D\nF : U S D\nR : U S D\nP : U S D\nc ia l lia b ilit\ne t a r y it e mD\n: N T DY\n: U S D\nD : U S D\nP : U S D\nc y\ns\nie\ns\n:\ns\nf u n c t io n a l c u r r e n c y )\nT\nD\nv\nh\ne\na\nr e e - m\ng r e e\nr ia t io\n1 %1\n%1\n%1\n%1\n%\n1 %1\n%1\n%1\n%\no\no\nn\nn\nf\nt h\nS\np e r io d e n d e\ne n s it iv it y a n\nE f f e c t o n\np r o f it o r lo\n$ 3 9 0 , 6 0\n2 , 9 0\n7 , 4 3\n3 , 4 1\n3 , 0 8\n$ 3 0 0 , 2 1\n1 0 , 1 2\n4 , 7 4\n2 , 2 8\nd\na\ns\n81689\n5012\nM\nly\ns\ns\na r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 2\nis\nE f f e c t o n o t h e r\nc o m p r e h e n s iv e\nin c o m e\n$ 1 6 3 , 3 1 3\n-\n-\n-\n-\n$ 1 1 6 , 1 2 9\n-\n-\n-\nii.

Credit risk refers to the risk of financial loss to the Group arising from default by the clients\nor counterparties of financial instruments on the contract obligations. The main factor is\nthat counterparties could not repay in full the notes receivable, accounts receivable, contract\nassets and financial assets at amortised cost based on the agreed terms.\nii. The Group manages their credit risk taking into consideration the entire group’s concern.\nAccording to the Group’s credit policy, each local entity in the Group is responsible for\nmanaging and analysing the credit risk for each of their clients before standard payment and\ndelivery terms and conditions are offered. Internal risk control assesses the credit quality of\nthe customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.\niii. The Group manages their credit risk taking into consideration the entire group’s concern.\nFor banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with good credit rating\nare accepted.\niv. The Group adopts following assumptions under IFRS 9 to assess whether there has been a\nsignificant increase in credit risk on that instrument since initial recognition:\nIf the contract payments were past due over 30 days based on the terms, there has been a\nsignificant increase in credit risk on that instrument since initial recognition.\nv. The default occurs when the contract payments are past due over 30 days.\nvi. The following indicators are used to determine whether the credit impairment of debt\ninstruments has occurred:\n(i) It becomes probable that the issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation\ndue to their financial difficulties;\n(ii) The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial\ndifficulties;\n(iii) Default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments;\n(iv) Adverse changes in national or regional economic conditions that are expected to cause\na default.\nvii. The Group classifies customers’ accounts receivable and contract assets in accordance with\ngeographic area. The Group applies the modified approach based on the loss rate\nmethodology to estimate expected credit loss.\n~79~\nviii. The Group wrote-off the financial assets, which cannot be reasonably expected to be\nrecovered, after initiating recourse procedures. However, the Group will continue executing\nthe recourse procedures to secure their rights. As of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022\nand March 31, 2022, the Group has no written-off financial assets that are still under\nrecourse procedures\nix. The Group used the forecastability to adjust historical, timely information, economic\nconditions of the industry, GDP forecast and trade growth rate to assess the default\npossibility of notes receivable, accounts receivable (including related parties) and contract\nassets. As of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the loss rate\nmethodology is as follows:\n~80~\nM\nN\nM\nN\nU\n3\nM\nN\nD\nN\nD\nN\nU\n3\nD\nN\na r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2\no t p a s t d u e\na r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2\no t p a s t d u e\np t o 3 0 d a y s\n1 t o 1 8 0 d a y s\na r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2\no t p a s t d u e\ne c e m b e r 3 1 ,\no t p a s t d u e\ne c e m b e r 3 1 ,\no t p a s t d u e\np t o 3 0 d a y s\n1 t o 1 8 0 d a y s\ne c e m b e r 3 1 ,\no t p a s t d u e\n3\n3\n3\n2\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nN o t e s r e c e iv a b le\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 8 2\nA c c o u n t s r e c e iv a b\n( in c lu d in g r e la t e d p a r\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 1 8 , 7 9 5\n2 , 3 2 3\n7 7 4\n$ 2 1 , 8 9 3\nC o n t r a c t a s s e t s\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 1 , 1 1 2\nN o t e s r e c e iv a b le\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 9 1\nA c c o u n t s r e c e iv a b\n( in c lu d in g r e la t e d p a r\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 2 0 , 8 3 7\n4 , 4 1 6\n4 6 1\n$ 2 5 , 7 1 6\nC o n t r a c t a s s e t s\nT o t a l b o o k v a lu e\n$ 1 , 7 4 9\n, 8\nle\nt ie\n, 7\n, 9\n, 1\n, 8\n, 6\n, 4\nle\nt ie\n, 4\n, 8\n, 8\n, 0\n, 2\n3\ns\n7\n5\n4\n7\n9\n5\ns\n1\n5\n0\n7\n7\n1\n)\n0\n9\n3\n2\n1\n6\n)\n9\n0\n1\n0\n6\nE\n0\nE\n0\n0\n0\nE\n0\nE\n0\nE\n0\n0\n0\nE\n0\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nx\n0\nx\n0\n0\n0\nx\n0\nx\n0\nx\n0\n0\n0\nx\n0\np\n0\np\n0\n1\n1\np\n0\np\n0\np\n0\n0\n0\np\n0\ne\n0\ne\n0\n0\n5\ne\n0\ne\n0\ne\n0\n3\n6\ne\n0\nc\n1\nc\n0\n0\n0\nc\n1\nc\n1\nc\n0\n7\n1\nc\n1\nt e\n%\nt e\n%\n%\n%\nt e\n%\nt e\n%\nt e\n%\n%\n%\nt e\n%\nd\n~\nd\n~\n~\n~\nd\n~\nd\n~\nd\n~\n~\n~\nd\n~\nlo\n0 .\nlo\n0 .\n0 .\n1 .\nlo\n0 .\nlo\n0 .\nlo\n0 .\n0 .\n1 .\nlo\n0 .\ns\n8\ns\n6\n3\n8\ns\n3\ns\n5\ns\n5\n4\n9\ns\n1\ns\n1\ns\n2\n4\n6\ns\n4\ns\n0\ns\n8\n3\n4\ns\n0\nr\n0\nr\n4\n3\n7\nr\n3\nr\n0\nr\n3\n8\n0\nr\n5\na\n5\na\n2\n1\n6\na\n1\na\n0\na\n9\n1\n0\na\n6\nt e\n%\nt e\n%\n%\n%\nt e\n%\nt e\n%\nt e\n%\n%\n%\nt e\n%\nL o s s a llo w a\n$\nL o s s a llo w a\n$ 7\n2\n3\n$ 1 2\nL o s s a llo w a\n$\nL o s s a llo w a\n$\nL o s s a llo w a\n$ 3\n1\n1\n$ 6\nL o s s a llo w a\n$\nn c\n1\nn c\n, 3 3\n, 2 3\n, 1 3\n, 6 9\nn c\n4 9\nn c\n2\nn c\n, 5 0\n, 2 2\n, 8 4\n, 5 7\nn c\n3 4\ne\n9\ne\n3\n1\n5\n9\ne\n0\ne\n0\ne\n9\n6\n4\n9\ne\n8\nx.

The instruments the Group used market quoted prices as their fair values (that is, Level 1)\nare listed below by characteristics:\nii. Except for financial instruments with active markets, the fair value of other financial\ninstruments is measured by using valuation techniques or by reference to counterparty\nquotes. The fair value of financial instruments measured by using valuation techniques can\nbe referred to current fair value of instruments with similar terms and characteristics in\nsubstance, discounted cash flow method or other valuation methods, including calculated\nby applying model using market information available at the consolidated balance sheet\ndate (i.e. yield curves on the Taipei Exchange, average commercial paper interest rates\nquoted from Reuters).\niii. When assessing non-standard and low-complexity financial instruments, the Group adopts\nvaluation technique that is widely used by market participants. The inputs used in the\nvaluation method to measure these financial instruments are normally observable in the\nmarket.\niv. The valuation of derivative financial instruments is based on valuation model widely\naccepted by market participants, such as present value techniques and option pricing\nmodels. Forward exchange contracts are usually valued based on the current forward\nexchange rate. Structured interest derivative instruments are measured by using appropriate\noption pricing models (i.e. Black-Scholes model) or other valuation methods, such as\nMonte Carlo simulation.\n~86~\nM a r k e t q u o t e d p r ic e\nL\nC\nis\nlo\nt e\ns\nd\nin\ns\ng\nh\np\na\nr\nr e\nic\ns\ne\nv. The output of valuation model is an estimated value and the valuation technique may not\nbe able to capture all relevant factors of the Group’s financial and non-financial instruments.\nTherefore, the estimated value derived using valuation model is adjusted accordingly with\nadditional inputs, for example, model risk or liquidity risk and etc. In accordance with the\nGroup’s management policies and relevant control procedures relating to the valuation\nmodels used for fair value measurement, management believes adjustment to valuation is\nnecessary in order to reasonably represent the fair value of financial and non-financial\ninstruments at the consolidated balance sheet. The inputs and pricing information used\nduring valuation are carefully assessed and adjusted based on current market conditions.\nvi. The Group takes into account adjustments for credit risks to measure the fair value of\nfinancial and non-financial instruments to reflect credit risk of the counterparty and the\nGroup’s credit quality.\nE. For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no transfer between Level\n1 and Level 2.\nF. The following chart is the movement of Level 3 for the three-month periods ended March 31,\n2023 and 2022:\nNote: Recorded as unrealised gains or losses on valuation of investments in equity instruments\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income and exchange differences on\ntranslating the financial statements of foreign operations.\nG. For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no transfer into or out\nfrom Level 3.\nH. The Group is in charge of valuation procedures for fair value measurements being categorised\nwithin Level 3, which is to verify independent fair value of financial instruments. Such\nassessment is to ensure the valuation results are reasonable by applying independent information\nto make results close to current market conditions, confirming the resource of information is\nindependent, reliable and in line with other resources and represented as the exercisable price,\nand frequently calibrating valuation model, performing back-testing, updating inputs used to the\nvaluation model and making any other necessary adjustments to the fair value.\n~87~\nA\nG\nA\nt J a n\na in s\nc o m p\nt M a\nu a\na n\nr e\nr c\nr\nd\nh\nh\ny 1\nlo\ne n\n3 1\ns\ns\ns e\niv\ns\ne\nr e\nin\nc\nc\no\no\ng\nm\nn\ne\nis\n(\ne\nN\nd\no\nin\nt e\no\n)\nt h e r\n(\n$\n$\n2 0 2 3\n7\n7\n3\n2\n0\n3\n6\n6\n,\n,\n,\n7\n9\n7\n6\n6\n9\n5\n9\n6\n)\n$\n$\n2 0 2 2\n6\n6\n4\n4\n9\n4\n6\n1\n,\n,\n,\n8\n5\n4\n4\n9\n3\n1\n2\n3\nI.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2023 AND 2022\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor the convenience of readers and for information purpose only, the auditors’ report and the accompanying\nfinancial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in\nthe Republic of China. In the event of any discrepancy between the English version and the original Chinese\nversion or any differences in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language auditors’ report and\nfinancial statements shall prevail.\n~1~\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REVIEW REPORT TRANSLATED FROM CHINESE\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Evergreen Marine Corporation (Taiwan)\nLtd.\nIntroduction\nWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evergreen Marine\nCorporation (Taiwan) Ltd. and subsidiaries (the “Group”) as at September 30, 2023 and\n2022, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three-\nmonth and nine-month periods then ended, as well as the consolidated statements of\nchanges in equity and of cash flows for the nine-month periods then ended, and notes to\nthe consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting\npolicies. Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these\nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the\nPreparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and International Accounting\nStandard 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” that came into effect as endorsed by the\nFinancial Supervisory Commission. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these\nconsolidated financial statements based on our reviews.\nScope of Review\nExcept as explained in the following paragraph, we conducted our reviews in accordance\nwith the Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “Review of Financial Information\nPerformed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” of the Republic of China. A review\nof consolidated financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review\nprocedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit and consequently does\n~2~\nnot enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters\nthat might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nBasis for qualified conclusion\nAs explained in Note 4(3), we did not review the financial statements of certain\ninsignificant consolidated subsidiaries, which statements reflect total assets and total\nliabilities of NT$809,791 thousand and NT$306,027 thousand, constituting 0.09% and\n0.10% of the consolidated total assets and consolidated total liabilities as of September 30,\n2023, respectively, and total comprehensive loss of (NT$4,007) thousand and (NT$5,985)\nthousand for the three-month and nine-month periods then ended. These amounts and the\nrelated information disclosed in Note 13 were based on the unreviewed financial\nstatements of such investee companies.\nAs explained in Note 6(8), we did not review the financial statements of certain\ninvestments accounted for under the equity method, which statements reflect investments\naccounted for under the equity method of NT$3,759,448 thousand and NT$3,041,855\nthousand, constituting 0.48% and 0.35% of the consolidated total assets as of September\n30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and comprehensive income and loss under the equity\nmethod of NT$102,376 thousand, NT$100,053 thousand, NT$308,877 thousand and\nNT$290,139 thousand, constituting 0.29%, 0.08%, 0.58% and 0.08% of the consolidated\ntotal comprehensive income and loss for the three-month and nine-month periods then\nended. These amounts and the related information disclosed in Note 13 were based on the\nunreviewed financial statements of such investee companies.\n~3~\nQualified conclusion\nBased on our reviews and the reports of other independent auditors (please refer to other\nmatter section of the report), except for the possible effects on the consolidated financial\nstatements, if any, as might have been determined to be necessary had the financial\nstatements of certain investments accounted for under the equity method and the related\ninformation disclosed in Note 13 been reviewed by independent auditors as explained in\nthe preceding paragraph, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements do not present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at September 30, 2023 and\n2022, and of its consolidated financial performance for the three-month and nine-month\nperiods then ended and its consolidated cash flows for the nine-month periods then ended\nin accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by\nSecurities Issuers and International Accounting Standard 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”\nthat came into effect as endorsed by the Financial Supervisory Commission.\nOther matter – Review reports of other independent auditors\nWe did not review the financial statements of certain consolidated subsidiaries and\ninvestments accounted for under the equity method. Those financial statements were\nreviewed by other independent auditors, whose reports thereon have been furnished to us,\nand our report expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included in the\nfinancial statements and the information disclosed in Note 13 was based solely on the\nreview reports of other independent auditors. These consolidated subsidiaries reflect total\nassets of NT$86,528,102 thousand and NT$92,461,080 thousand, constituting 11.05%\nand 10.48% of the consolidated total assets as at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and total\noperating revenues of NT$586,968 thousand, NT$611,911 thousand, NT$1,994,595\n~4~\nthousand and NT$1,793,636 thousand, constituting 0.81%, 0.36%, 0.96% and 0.35% of\nthe consolidated total operating revenues for the three-month and nine-month periods then\nended. The comprehensive income and loss under equity method was NT$682,904\nthousand, NT$1,149,261, NT$3,783,169 and NT$5,967,995 thousand, constituting 1.90%,\n0.93%, 7.08% and 1.69% of the consolidated total comprehensive income and loss for the\nthree-month and nine-month periods then ended.\nLai, Chung-Hsi Chou, Hsiao-Tzu\nFor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Taiwan\nNovember 13, 2023\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are not intended to present the financial position and\nresults of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\ncountries and jurisdictions other than the Republic of China. The standards, procedures and practices in the\nRepublic of China governing the audit of such financial statements may differ from those generally accepted\nin countries and jurisdictions other than the Republic of China.

Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected\nto be paid in respect of service rendered by employees in a period and should be recognised as\nexpense in that period when the employees render service.\nB. Pensions\n(a) Defined contribution plans\nFor defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognised as pension expense when\nthey are due on an accrual basis. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent\nof a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments.\n(b) Defined benefit plans\ni. Net obligation under a defined benefit plan is defined as the present value of an amount of\npension benefits that employees will receive on retirement for their services with the Group\nin current period or prior periods. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of\ndefined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the\nbalance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The net defined benefit obligation is\ncalculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The\nrate used to discount is determined by using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds\nthat are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms\nto maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability; when there is no\ndeep market in high-quality corporate bonds, the Group uses interest rates of government\nbonds (at the balance sheet date) instead.\nii. Remeasurements arising on defined benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive\nincome in the period in which they arise and are recorded as retained earnings.\niii. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n~24~\nN\nN\nN\nE\nI\nC\nC\ne t c a s h p r o v id e d b y o\na c t iv it ie s\ne t c a s h u s e d in in v e s t\ne t c a s h u s e d in f in a n c\nf f e c t o f e x c h a n g e r a t e\nc a s h e q u iv a le n t s\nn c r e a s e in c a s h a n d c a\na s h a n d c a s h e q u iv a le\nb e g in n in g o f p e r io d\na s h a n d c a s h e q u iv a le\ne n d o f p e r io d\np e r a t in g\nin g a c t iv\nin g a c t iv\ns o n c a s\ns h e q u iv\nn t s ,\nn t s ,\nit ie s\nit ie s\nh a n\na le n t\nd\ns\n(\n(\nE M U\nN in e - m o n t h p e r io d\nS e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2\n$ 4 , 8\n2 , 7\n3\n2 , 3\n1 , 4\n$ 3 , 7\ne\n0\n5\n9\n5\n5\n6\n3\n9\nn\n2\n9\n9\n3\n5\n2\n2\n4\nd\n2\n, 8\n, 5\n, 0\n, 3\n, 5\n, 3\n, 8\ne\n2\n6\n6\n8\n7\n1\n9\nd\n2\n5\n2\n2\n7\n8\n5\n)\n)\niv. Pension cost for the interim period is calculated on a year-to-date basis by using the\npension cost rate derived from the actuarial valuation at the end of the prior financial year,\nadjusted for significant market fluctuations since that time and for significant curtailments,\nsettlements, or other significant one-off events. Also, the related information is disclosed\naccordingly.\nC. Termination benefits\nTermination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of\nemployment as a result from either the Group’s decision to terminate an employee’s employment\nbefore the normal retirement date, or an employee’s decision to accept an offer of redundancy\nbenefits in exchange for the termination of employment. The Group recognises expense as it can\nno longer withdraw an offer of termination benefits or it recognises relating restructuring costs,\nwhichever is earlier. Benefits that are expected to be due more than 12 months after balance sheet\ndate shall be discounted to their present value.\nD. Employees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration\nEmployees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration are recognised as expense and liability,\nprovided that such recognition is required under legal or constructive obligation and those\namounts can be reliably estimated. Any difference between the resolved amounts and the\nsubsequently actual distributed amounts is accounted for as changes in estimates. If employee\ncompensation is paid by shares, the Group calculates the number of shares based on the closing\nprice at the previous day of the board meeting resolution.\n(5) Income tax\nA. The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or\nloss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or\nitems recognised directly in equity, in which cases the tax is recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or equity.\nB. The current income tax expense is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively\nenacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate\nand generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns\nwith respect to situations in accordance with applicable tax regulations. It establishes provisions\nwhere appropriate based on the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. An additional\ntax is levied on the unappropriated retained earnings and is recorded as income tax expense in\nthe year the stockholders resolve to retain the earnings.\nC. Deferred income tax is recognised, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary\ndifferences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in\nthe consolidated balance sheet. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising\non investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the\ntemporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference\nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and\n~25~\nlaws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected\nto apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability\nis settled.\nD. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit\nwill be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. At each balance sheet\ndate, unrecognised and recognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed.\nE. Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance\nsheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an\nintention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset on the balance sheet when the entity has the\nlegally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and they are\nlevied by the same taxation authority on either the same entity or different entities that intend to\nsettle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nF. A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carryforward of unused tax credits resulting from\nacquisitions of equipment and equity investments to the extent that it is possible that future\ntaxable profit will be available against which the unused tax credits can be utilised.\nG. The interim period income tax expense is recognised based on the estimated average annual\neffective income tax rate expected for the full financial year applied to the pretax income of the\ninterim period, and the related information is disclosed accordingly.\nH. If a change in tax rate is enacted or substantively enacted in an interim period, the Group\nrecognises the effect of the change immediately in the interim period in which the change occurs.\nThe effect of the change on items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised in other\ncomprehensive income or equity while the effect of the change on items recognised in profit or\nloss is recognised in profit or loss.\n5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND KEY SOURCES OF\nASSUMPTION UNCERTAINTY\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical\njudgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies and make critical assumptions and estimates\nconcerning future events. Assumptions and estimates may differ from the actual results and are\ncontinually evaluated and adjusted based on historical experience and other factors. Such assumptions\nand estimates have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities within the next financial year; and the related information is addressed below:\n(1) Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies\nLease term\nIn determining the lease term, the Group takes into consideration all facts and circumstances that\ncreate an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not to exercise a termination option,\nincluding the expected changes of all fact and situation for the period from the commencement date\nof lease to the execution date of options. Also, the Group took into consideration the main factors,\n~26~\nsuch as the contract terms and conditions during the option covered period and the importance to\nlessee’s operation if the significant lease improvement and underlying assets incurred during the\ncontract terms. When significant events or significant changes occur within the Group’s control, the\nlease term will be re-estimated.\n(2) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions\nRevenue recognition\nThe Group primarily engages in global container shipping service covering ocean-going and near-sea\nshipping line. Despite the Group conducting business worldwide, its transactions are all in small\namounts, whereas the freight rate is subject to fluctuation caused by cargo loading rate as well as\nmarket competition. Worldwide shipping agencies use a system to record the transactions by entering\ndata including shipping departure, destination, counterparty, transit time, shipping amounts, and\nfreight price for the Group. Therefore, the Group could recognise freight revenue in accordance with\nthe data on bill of lading reports generated from the system, accompanied by estimation made from\npast experience and current cargo loading conditions the revenue that would flow in. Since ocean-\ngoing shipping often lasts for several days, voyages are sometimes completed after the balance sheet\ndate. Also, demands for freight are consistently sent by forwarders during voyage. Due to the factors\nmentioned above, freight revenue is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method for each\nvessel during the reporting period. As the estimation of freight revenue are subject to management’s\njudgement, therefore freight revenue involves high uncertainty. Given the conditions mentioned\nabove, this may result in adjustments to the estimation amounts.\n6. DETAILS OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTS\n(1) Cash and cash equivalents\nA. The Group transacts with a variety of financial institutions all with high credit quality to disperse\ncredit risk, so it expects that the probability of counterparty default is remote.\nB.

After the disposal and due\nto the conversion of EVA’s convertible bonds into stocks during the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company’s share interest in EVA decreased to 7.43% as of September\n30, 2023.\nF.

The\ntransaction date was January 1, 2023.\nG. Considering that Evergreen Steel Corp. generates stable profits from its main business and the\noutlook of the environmental protection and green energy industry in which Evergreen Steel Corp.\nreinvests is promising, on November 4, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to\nacquire the equity interest in Evergreen Steel Corp. through stock exchange market to purchase\n79,248 thousand shares at a price of $48.20 per share and acquire 19% equity interests in the entity\nand the transaction price amounted to $3,819,754.\nH.

The Company is the single largest shareholder of EITC with a 40.36% equity interest. Given that\nthe main source of economic profits of EITC’s related party transactions is generated from\nEvergreen Line, and there is no agreement between the Group and other related parties of\nEvergreen Line to make decisions in consultation or collectively; however, in order to maintain\nthe equity balance between the Group and other related parties, the Company governs EITC with\nother related parties to maintain mutual and other shareholders’ best interests; apart from\nindependent directors, the number of seats held by the Company on the Board are the same as\nother related parties’, which indicates that the Company has no current ability to direct the relevant\nactivities of EITC, thus, the Company has no control, but only has significant influence, over the\ninvestee.\n~37~\nE\nE\nE\nv\na\nV\nv\ne r\nn d\nA\ne r\ng r\nT\nA\ng r\ne e\nr a\nir\ne e\nn\nn\nw\nn\nI n t\ns p o\na y s\nS t e\ne r n a\nr t C\nC o\ne l C\nt io n a l S\no r p o r a t\nr p o r a t io\no r p .\nt\nio\nn\no\nn\nr a g e\nS\n$\n$\ne p t e m b e r\n1 2\n1 1\n5\n2 9\n3\n, 2\n, 9\n, 6\n, 8\n0\n9\n3\n2\n5\n,\n6\n3\n6\n6\n2\n, 2\n, 8\n, 6\n, 7\n0\n6\n8\n0\n5\n2\n2\n9\n8\n9\n3 D\n$\n$\ne c e m b e r\n1 1\n2 1\n4\n3 7\n3\n, 9\n, 8\n, 0\n, 9\n1\n7\n5\n8\n2\n,\n3\n9\n9\n2\n2\n,\n,\n,\n,\n0\n2\n6\n1\n0\n2\n4\n3\n9\n7\n2\n3\n2\n7\n2\nS\n$\n$\ne p t e m b e r 3\n1 3 , 5\n2 1 , 8\n3 5 , 4\n0\n8\n9\n8\n, 2 0 2 2\n8 , 3 3 9\n8 , 4 5 9\n-\n6 , 7 9 8\nJ. The Company is the single largest shareholder of TPCT with a 27.85% equity interest.

Financial risk management policies\n(a) The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign\nexchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s\noverall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and\nseeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial position and financial\nperformance.\n(b) Risk management is carried out by the Group’s Finance Department under policies approved\nby the Board of Directors. The Group’s Finance Department identifies, evaluates and hedges\nfinancial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s Operating Department. The Board of\nDirectors provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies\ncovering specific areas and matters, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit\nrisk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and\ninvestment of excess liquidity.\nC. Significant financial risks and degrees of financial risks\n(a) Market risk\nForeign exchange risk\ni. The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from\nvarious currency exposures, primarily with respect to the USD, EUR and CNY. Foreign\nexchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities\nand net investment in foreign operations.\nii. The Group’s management has set up a policy to require group companies to manage their\nforeign exchange risk against their functional currency. The group companies are required\nto hedge their entire foreign exchange risk exposure with the Group’s Finance Department.\nTo manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and\nrecognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward foreign exchange\ncontracts, transacted with Group’s Finance Department. Foreign exchange risk arises when\nfuture commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a\nforeign currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.\n~88~\niii. The Group’s businesses involve some non-functional currency operations (the Company’s\nand certain subsidiaries’ functional currency: NTD; other certain subsidiaries’ functional\ncurrency: USD, EUR, CNY and others).

The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the\nGroup and classified on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income. The Group is not exposed to significant commodity price risk. To\nmanage its price risk arising from investments in equity securities, the Group diversifies its\nportfolio. Diversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the\nGroup.\nii. The Group’s investments in equity securities comprise domestic listed and unlisted stocks.\nThe prices of equity securities would change due to the change of the future value of\ninvestee companies. If the prices of these equity securities had increased/decreased by 1%\nwith all other variables held constant, equity would have increased/decreased by $18,619\nand $17,355 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively,\nas a result of other comprehensive income classified as equity investment at fair value\nthrough other comprehensive income.\nCash flow and fair value interest rate risk\ni. The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at\nvariable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by\ncash and cash equivalents held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose\nthe Group to fair value interest rate risk. During the nine-month periods ended September\n30, 2023 and 2022, the Group’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in the NTD\nand USD.\nii. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, if interest rates on borrowings had been 1% higher/lower\nwith all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the nine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022 would have been $375,810 and $304,064 lower/higher,\nrespectively, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate\nborrowings.\n(b) Credit risk\ni. Credit risk refers to the risk of financial loss to the Group arising from default by the clients\nor counterparties of financial instruments on the contract obligations. The main factor is\nthat counterparties could not repay in full the notes receivable, accounts receivable, contract\nassets and financial assets at amortised cost based on the agreed terms.\nii. The Group manages their credit risk taking into consideration the entire group’s concern.\nAccording to the Group’s credit policy, each local entity in the Group is responsible for\nmanaging and analysing the credit risk for each of their clients before standard payment and\ndelivery terms and conditions are offered. Internal risk control assesses the credit quality of\nthe customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.\n~92~\niii. The Group manages their credit risk taking into consideration the entire group’s concern.\nFor banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with good credit rating\nare accepted.\niv. The Group adopts following assumptions under IFRS 9 to assess whether there has been a\nsignificant increase in credit risk on that instrument since initial recognition:\nIf the contract payments were past due over 30 days based on the terms, there has been a\nsignificant increase in credit risk on that instrument since initial recognition.\nv. The default occurs when the contract payments are past due over 30 days.\nvi. The following indicators are used to determine whether the credit impairment of debt\ninstruments has occurred:\n(i) It becomes probable that the issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation\ndue to their financial difficulties;\n(ii) The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial\ndifficulties;\n(iii) Default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments;\n(iv) Adverse changes in national or regional economic conditions that are expected to cause\na default.\nvii. The Group classifies customers’ accounts receivable and contract assets in accordance with\ngeographic area. The Group applies the modified approach based on the loss rate\nmethodology to estimate expected credit loss.\nviii. The Group wrote-off the financial assets, which cannot be reasonably expected to be\nrecovered, after initiating recourse procedures. However, the Group will continue executing\nthe recourse procedures to secure their rights. As of September 30, 2023, December 31,\n2022 and September 30, 2022, the Group has no written-off financial assets that are still\nunder recourse procedures.\nix. The Group used the forecastability to adjust historical, timely information, economic\nconditions of the industry, GDP forecast and trade growth rate to assess the default\npossibility of notes receivable, accounts receivable (including related parties) and contract\nassets. As of September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the loss rate\nmethodology is as follows:\n~93~\nS\nN\ne\no\np\nt\nt e\np\nm\na\nb\ns t\ne r\nd u\n3\ne\n0 , 2 0 2 3\n$\nN\nT\no t e s r e\no t a l b o\nc\no\ne\nk\niv a b le\nv a lu e\n9 0 , 8 6 1\nE\n0\nx\n. 0\np\n0\ne\n0\nc\n0\nt e\n%\nd\n~\nlo\n0\ns\n. 5\ns\n0\nr\n0\na t\n0\ne\n% $\nL o s s a llo w a n c\n2\ne\n2\nAccounts receivable\n(including related parties)\nSeptember 30, 2023 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 1 7,476,526 0.0100%~0.6313% $ 8,204\nUp to 30 days 2 ,944,041 0.0100%~0.2500% 3 ,179\n31 to 180 days 111,705 0.0017%~1.1775% 907\n$ 2 0,532,272 $ 12,290\nContract assets\nSeptember 30, 2023 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 1,768,623 0.0508%~0.0547% $ 783\nNotes receivable\nDecember 31, 2022 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 91,456 0.0001%~0.5000% $ 20\nAccounts receivable\n(including related parties)\nDecember 31, 2022 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 2 0,837,419 0.0000%~0.5839% $ 3,509\nUp to 30 days 4 ,416,850 0.0037%~0.4381% 1 ,226\n31 to 180 days 461,801 0.0061%~1.9400% 1,844\n$ 2 5,716,070 $ 6,579\nContract assets\nDecember 31, 2022 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 1,749,276 0.0001%~0.1056% $ 348\nNotes receivable\nSeptember 30, 2022 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 199,128 0.0001%~0.0307% $ 18\nUp to 30 days 8,653 0% -\n$ 207,781 $ 18\nAccounts receivable\n(including related parties)\nSeptember 30, 2022 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 3 2,902,305 0.0000%~0.1056% $ 905\nUp to 30 days 5 ,492,337 0.0101%~0.4381% 3 ,897\n31 to 180 days 498,200 0.0151%~1.9400% 458\n$ 3 8,892,842 $ 5,260\nContract assets\nSeptember 30, 2022 Total book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nNot past due $ 3,536,096 0.0001%~0.1056% $ 25\n~94~\nx.

The Group does not expect the timing of occurrence of the cash flows estimated through\nthe maturity date analysis will be significantly earlier, nor expect the actual cash flow\namount will be significantly different.\n(3) Fair value estimation\nA. The different levels that the inputs to valuation techniques are used to measure fair value of\nfinancial and non-financial instruments have been defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the\nentity can access at the measurement date. A market is regarded as active if it meets all\nthe following conditions: the items traded in the market are homogeneous; willing\nbuyers and sellers can normally be found at any time; and prices are available to the\npublic. The fair value of the Group’s investment in listed stocks, beneficiary certificates\nand derivative instruments with quoted market prices is included in Level.\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset\nor liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nB.

The instruments the Group used market quoted prices as their fair values (that is, Level 1)\nare listed below by characteristics:\nii. Except for financial instruments with active markets, the fair value of other financial\ninstruments is measured by using valuation techniques or by reference to counterparty\nquotes. The fair value of financial instruments measured by using valuation techniques can\nbe referred to current fair value of instruments with similar terms and characteristics in\nsubstance, discounted cash flow method or other valuation methods, including calculated\nby applying model using market information available at the consolidated balance sheet\ndate (i.e. yield curves on the Taipei Exchange, average commercial paper interest rates\nquoted from Reuters).\niii. When assessing non-standard and low-complexity financial instruments, the Group adopts\nvaluation technique that is widely used by market participants. The inputs used in the\nvaluation method to measure these financial instruments are normally observable in the\nmarket.\niv. The valuation of derivative financial instruments is based on valuation model widely\naccepted by market participants, such as present value techniques and option pricing\nmodels. Forward exchange contracts are usually valued based on the current forward\nexchange rate. Structured interest derivative instruments are measured by using appropriate\noption pricing models (i.e. Black-Scholes model) or other valuation methods, such as\nMonte Carlo simulation.\nv. The output of valuation model is an estimated value and the valuation technique may not\nbe able to capture all relevant factors of the Group’s financial and non-financial instruments.\nTherefore, the estimated value derived using valuation model is adjusted accordingly with\nadditional inputs, for example, model risk or liquidity risk and etc. In accordance with the\nGroup’s management policies and relevant control procedures relating to the valuation\nmodels used for fair value measurement, management believes adjustment to valuation is\nnecessary in order to reasonably represent the fair value of financial and non-financial\ninstruments at the consolidated balance sheet. The inputs and pricing information used\nduring valuation are carefully assessed and adjusted based on current market conditions.\nvi. The Group takes into account adjustments for credit risks to measure the fair value of\nfinancial and non-financial instruments to reflect credit risk of the counterparty and the\nGroup’s credit quality.\nE. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, there was no transfer between\nLevel 1 and Level 2.\n~100~\nM a r k e t q u o t e d p r ic e\nL\nC\nis\nlo\nt e\ns\nd\nin\ns\ng\nh\np\na\nr\nr e\nic\ns\ne\nF.

The Group is in charge of valuation procedures for fair value measurements being categorised\nwithin Level 3, which is to verify independent fair value of financial instruments. Such\nassessment is to ensure the valuation results are reasonable by applying independent information\nto make results close to current market conditions, confirming the resource of information is\nindependent, reliable and in line with other resources and represented as the exercisable price,\nand frequently calibrating valuation model, performing back-testing, updating inputs used to the\nvaluation model and making any other necessary adjustments to the fair value.\n~101~\nA\nG\nA\nt J a n\na in s\nc o m p\nt S e p\nu a\na n\nr e\nt e\nr\nd\nh\nm\ny 1\nlo s s e s r e\ne n s iv e in\nb e r 3 0\nc\nc\no\no\ng\nm\nn\ne\nis\n(\ne\nN\nd\no\nin\nt e\no\n)\nt h e r\n$\n$\n2 0 2 3\n7\n8\n3\n9\n2\n3\n2\n5\n,\n,\n,\n7\n1\n9\n6\n8\n4\n5\n0\n5\n$\n$\n2 0 2 2\n6\n1\n7\n4\n1\n5\n4\n4\n9\n,\n,\n,\n8\n7\n6\n4\n8\n2\n1\n4\n5\nI.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the related parent company only statements of comprehensive income, of changes in\nequity and of cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to the financial statements,\nincluding a summary of significant accounting policies.\nIn our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors (please refer to Other\nMatter section of our report), the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Evergreen Marine Corporation (Taiwan) Ltd.\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and its financial performance and its cash flows for\nthe years then ended in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of\nFinancial Reports by Securities Issuers and the International Financial Reporting\nStandards, International Accounting Standards, IFRIC Interpretations, and SIC\nInterpretations that came into effect as endorsed by the Financial Supervisory\nCommission .\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and\nAttestation of Financial Statements by Certified Public Accountants and Standards on\nAuditing of the Republic of China. Our responsibilities under those standards are further\ndescribed in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\nsection of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Norm\nof Professional Ethics for Certified Public Accountants of the Republic of China, and we\nhave fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n~2~\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to\nprovide a basis for our opinion.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most\nsignificance in our audit of the financial statements. These matters were addressed in the\ncontext of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and, in forming our opinion\nthereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nKey audit matters for the parent company only financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31,2023 are stated as follows:\nAccuracy and cut-off of freight revenue\nDescription\nPlease refer to Note 4(31) for accounting policy on revenue recognition, Note 5(2) for\nuncertainty of accounting estimates and assumptions applied on revenue recognition, and\nNote 6(23) for details of sales revenue, Note 6(8) for details of investments accounted for\nusing equity method, and Table 9 for information on investees accounted for using equity\nmethod.\nThe Company, its directly held subsidiaries, Peony Investment S.A. and Evergreen Marine\n(Asia) Pte. Ltd., which are recognised in investments accounted for using equity method,\nand its subsidiary, Evergreen Marine (Hong Kong) Ltd., which is directly and indirectly\nheld an 80% equity interest by the Company, primarily engages in global container\nshipping service covering ocean-going and near-sea shipping line, shipping agency\nbusiness as well as container freight station business. Since ocean-going shipping often\nlasts for several days, voyages are sometimes completed after the balance sheet date. Also,\ndemand for freight services is consistently sent by forwarders during voyage. Due to the\nfactors mentioned above, freight revenue is recognized under the percentage-of-\ncompletion method for each vessel of which the service has been provided during the\nreporting period.\n~3~\nDespite the Company and its investee companies conducting business worldwide, its\ntransactions are all in small amounts, whereas the freight rate is subject to fluctuation\ncaused by cargo loading rate as well as market competition. Worldwide shipping agencies\nuse a system to record the transactions by entering data including shipping departure,\ndestination, counterparty, transit time, shipping amounts, and freight price for the\nCompany. Therefore, the management could recognise freight revenue in accordance with\nthe data on bill of lading reports generated from the system, accompanied by estimations\nmade from past experience and current cargo loading conditions the revenue that would\nflow in, and calculate the revenue under percentage-of-completion method. As the process\nof recording transactions, communicating with agencies, maintaining the system are done\nmanually, and the estimation of freight revenue is subject to management’s judgement,\ntherefore freight revenue involves high uncertainty and is material to the financial\nstatements. Given the conditions as described above, we consider the accuracy of freight\nrevenue and the appropriate use of cut-off by the Company and its investee companies as\na key audit matter.\nHow our audit addressed the matter\nWe and other auditors performed the following audit procedures on the above key audit\nmatter:\n1. Obtained an understanding of the operation and industry of the Company and its\ninvestee companies to assess the reasonableness of policies and procedures on revenue\nrecognition, and confirmed whether it is appropriate to the financial statements.\n2. Obtained an understanding of the procedures of revenue recognition from booking,\npicking, billing to receiving. Assessed and tested relevant internal controls, including\nchecking freight items and amounts of delivery information against the approved\ncontracts and booking list. In addition, recalculated the accuracy of freight revenue,\nand ensured its consistency with the bill of lading report.\n~4~\n3. Obtained the estimated freight income report for vessels underway as of balance sheet\ndate, and inquired with management for the reasonableness of judgment. In addition,\nchecked historical freight revenue for total voyage under each individual vessel, along\nwith comparing with current cargo loading condition as well as actual revenue\nreceived after period end to ensure the reasonableness of revenue assumptions.\n4. Confirmed the completeness of vessels underway for the reporting period, including\ntracking the movements of shipments on the internet to ensure the vessels that depart\nbefore period end have been taken into consideration in the freight revenue calculation.\n5. Verified accuracy of data used in calculating percentage of completion under each\nvoyage, including selecting samples and checking whether the total shipping days\nshown on the Company’s website are in agreement with cruises timetable, considering\nthe number of days delayed in shipping routes due to port congestion as well as\nrecalculating the shipping days (days between departure and balance sheet date), in\norder to examine the reasonableness of percentage applied.\nSignificant transactions in investments accounted for using equity method\nDescription\nPlease refer to Note 4(14) for accounting policy on investments accounted for using equity\nmethod, Note 6(7) for details of investments accounted for under equity method, and Table\n9 for information on investees accounted for using equity method.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company owns directly and indirectly 100% equity\ninterests in the subsidiary, Evergreen Marine (Asia) Pte. Ltd. which is recognised in\ninvestments accounted for using equity method amounting to NT$205,719,723 thousand,\nconstituting 40.23% of total assets, and recognised gain on investments for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 amounting to NT$22,495,972 thousand.\n~5~\nIn July 2023, the subsidiary, Evergreen Marine (Asia) Pte. Ltd. acquired a 100% equity\ninterest in Evergreen Marine (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. by cash amounting to NT$24,133,200\nthousand, and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets amounted to\nNT$29,097,422 thousand and gain recognised in bargain purchase transaction generated\nwas NT$4,964,222 thousand. This business combination was a significant transaction\nduring the financial reporting period, the fair value of identifiable net assets were\nestimated based on management’s assessment and price allocation reports prepared by the\nindependent expert appraisers appointed by the company mentioned above. Because the\nassessment and measurement of the fair value are subject to material judgements and\naccounting estimations, and are significant to the financial statements, therefore, we\nidentified purchase price allocation a key audit matter.\nHow our audit addressed the matter\nWe performed the following audit procedures on the above key audit matter:\n1. Assessed the competence and objectivity of the external appraiser engaged by the\nmanagement.\n2. Reviewed the measurement of fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities, the\ndiscount rate and the reasonableness of calculation of gain recognised in bargain\npurchase transaction in the report of purchase price allocation issued by the external\nappraiser by the auditors.\n~6~\nOther matter – Reference to the audits of other auditors\nWe did not audit the financial statements of all the investee companies accounted for using\nequity method. Those statements were audited by other independent auditors whose\nreports thereon have been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it\nrelates to the amounts included for those investee companies accounted for using equity\nmethod and information disclosed in Note 13 relating to these long-term equity\ninvestments, is based solely on the reports of the other independent auditors. Long-term\nequity investments in these investee companies amounted to NT$ 48,200,819 thousand\nand NT$ 53,183,389 thousand, constituting 9.43% and 8.13% of the total assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and comprehensive income (loss) (including\nshare of profit or loss and share of other comprehensive income of associates and joint\nventures accounted for using equity method) was NT$ 6,608,737 thousand and NT$\n7,365,951 thousand, constituting 19.10% and 2.09% of the total comprehensive income\n(loss) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nResponsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the\nparent company only financial statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial\nstatements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial\nReports by Securities Issuers and the International Financial Reporting Standards,\nInternational Accounting Standards, IFRIC Interpretations, and SIC Interpretations that\ncame into effect as endorsed by the Financial Supervisory Commission, and for such\ninternal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n~7~\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters\nrelated to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless\nmanagement either intends to liquidate the Company, or to cease operations, or has no\nrealistic alternative but to do so.\nThose charged with governance, including supervisors, are responsible for overseeing the\nCompany’s financial reporting process.\nAuditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the parent company only financial\nstatements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the parent company only\nfinancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud\nor error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance\nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance\nwith the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are\nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected\nto influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these parent company\nonly financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China,\nwe exercise professional judgement and professional skepticism throughout the audit. We\nalso:\n~8~\n1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the parent company only\nfinancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit\nprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud\nmay involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the\noverride of internal control.\n2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design\naudit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.\n3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of\naccounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of\naccounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty\nexists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material\nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the\nrelated disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,\nto modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up\nto the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause\nthe Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the parent company only\nfinancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements\nrepresent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair\npresentation.\n6. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of\nthe entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the\nfinancial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and\nperformance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n~9~\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the\nplanned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any\nsignificant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied\nwith relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with\nthem all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those\nmatters that were of most significance in the audit of the parent company only financial\nstatements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these\nmatters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about\nthe matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should\nnot be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would\nreasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nLai, Chung-Hsi Chou, Hsiao-Tzu\nFor and on Behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Taiwan\nMarch 14, 2024\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements are not intended to present the financial\nposition and results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in countries and jurisdictions other than the Republic of China.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these parent company only financial\nstatements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented,\nunless otherwise stated.\n(1) Compliance statement\nThese parent company only financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the\n“Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers”.\n(2) Basis of preparation\nA. Except for the following items, these parent company only financial statements have been prepared\nunder the historical cost convention:\n~18~\nA\nA\nnA\nA\nm\nm\nom\nm\nn\ne\ne\ne\ne\nn\nn\nn\nn\nd\nd\ncd\nd\nm\nm\num\nm\nr\ne\ne\nre\ne\nn\nn\nen\nn\nN\nt s\nt s\nn tt\ns\nt s\ne\nt\nt\n’\nt\nt\nw\no\no\no\no\nS\nI F\nI A\nI A\nI A\nt a\nR\nS\nS\nS\nn\nS\nd\n1\n1\n7\na r d s , I n t e r p r e t a t io\n1 6 , ‘ L e a s e lia b ilit y\n, ‘ C la s s if ic a t io n o f\n, ‘ N o n - c u r r e n t lia b\na n d I F R S 7 , ‘ S u p\nn s a n d A m e n d m e n t s\nin a s a le a n d le a s e b a c k\nlia b ilit ie s a s c u r r e n t o r\nilit ie s w it h c o v e n a n t s ’\np lie r f in a n c e a r r a n g e m e\n’\nn t s ’\nI n t e\nE\nr n\nS\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\nf f e c\na t io\nt a n d\na n u a\na n u a\na n u a\na n u a\nt iv\nn a\na r\nr y\nr y\nr y\nr y\ne\nl A\nd s\n1\n1\n1\n1\nd a\nc\nB\n, 2\n, 2\n, 2\n, 2\nt e b y\nc o u n\no a r d\n0 2 4\n0 2 4\n0 2 4\n0 2 4\nt in g\nEffective date by\nInternational Accounting\nNew Standards, Interpretations and Amendments Standards Board\nAmendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28, ‘Sale or contribution of assets To be determined by\nbetween an investor and its associate or joint venture’ International Accounting\nStandards Board\nIFRS 17, ‘Insurance contracts’ January 1, 2023\nAmendments to IFRS 17, 'Insurance contracts' January 1, 2023\nAmendment to IFRS 17, 'Initial application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – January 1, 2023\ncomparative information'\nAmendments to IAS 21, ‘Lack of exchangeability’ January 1, 2025\n(a) Financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through\nprofit or loss.\n(b) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n(c) Defined benefit liabilities recognised based on the net amount of pension fund assets less\npresent value of defined benefit obligation.\nB. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting\nStandards, International Accounting Standards, IFRIC Interpretations, and SIC Interpretations that\ncame into effect as endorsed by the FSC (collectively referred herein as the “IFRSs”) requires the\nuse of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement\nin the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree\nof judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the parent\ncompany only financial statements are disclosed in Note 5.\n(3) Foreign currency translation\nItems included in the parent company only financial statements of Company are measured using the\ncurrency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional\ncurrency”). The parent company only financial statements are presented in New Taiwan Dollars,\nwhich is the Company’s functional currency.\nA. Foreign currency transactions and balances\n(a) Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange\nrates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured.\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions are\nrecognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise, except when deferred in other\ncomprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n(b) Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end are re-\ntranslated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences\narising upon re-translation at the balance sheet date are recognised in profit or loss.\n(c) Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies held at fair value\nthrough profit or loss are re-translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet\ndate; their translation differences are recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies held at fair value through other comprehensive\nincome are re-translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date; their\ntranslation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. However, non-\nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are not measured at fair\nvalue are translated using the historical exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.\n(d) All other foreign exchange gains and losses based on the nature of those transactions are\npresented in the statement of comprehensive income within ‘other gains and losses’.\nB. Translation of foreign operations\n(a) The operating results and financial position of all the company entities and associates that have\na functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the\n~19~\npresentation currency as follows:\ni. Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing exchange\nrate at the date of that balance sheet;\nii. Income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at average\nexchange rates of that period; and\niii. All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n(b) When the foreign operation partially disposed of or sold is an associate, exchange differences\nthat were recorded in other comprehensive income are proportionately reclassified to profit or\nloss as part of the gain or loss on sale. In addition, even when the Company retains partial\ninterest in the former foreign associate after losing significant influence over the former\nforeign associate, such transactions should be accounted for as disposal of all interest in these\nforeign operations.\n(c) When the foreign operation partially disposed of or sold is a subsidiary, cumulative exchange\ndifferences that were recorded in other comprehensive income are proportionately transferred\nto the non-controlling interest in this foreign operation. In addition, even when the Company\nretains partial interest in the former foreign subsidiary after losing control of the former foreign\nsubsidiary, such transactions should be accounted for as disposal of all interest in the foreign\noperation.\n(d) Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated\nas assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing exchange rates at the\nbalance sheet date.\n(4) Classification of current and non-current items\nA. Assets that meet one of the following criteria are classified as current assets; otherwise they are\nclassified as non-current assets:\n(a) Assets arising from operating activities that are expected to be realised, or are intended to be\nsold or consumed within the normal operating cycle;\n(b) Assets held mainly for trading purposes;\n(c) Assets that are expected to be realised within twelve months from the balance sheet date;\n(d) Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents and those that are to\nbe exchanged or used to settle liabilities more than twelve months after the balance sheet date.\nB. Liabilities that meet one of the following criteria are classified as current liabilities; otherwise they\nare classified as non-current liabilities:\n(a) Liabilities that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle;\n(b) Liabilities arising mainly from trading activities;\n(c) Liabilities that are to be settled within twelve months from the balance sheet date;\n(d) Liabilities for which the repayment date cannot be extended unconditionally to more than\ntwelve months after the balance sheet date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the\ncounterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its\nclassification.\n~20~\n(5) Cash equivalents\nCash equivalents refer to short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known\namounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Time deposits with\noriginal maturities of three months or less that meet the definition above and are held for the purpose\nof meeting short-term cash commitments in operations are classified as cash equivalents.\n(6) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nA. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets that are not measured at\namortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income.\nB. On a regular way purchase or sale basis, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are\nrecognised and derecognised using trade date accounting.\nC. At initial recognition, the Company measures the financial assets at fair value and recognises the\ntransaction costs in profit or loss. The Company subsequently measures the financial assets at fair\nvalue, and recognises the gain or loss in profit or loss.\nD. The Company recognises the dividend income when the right to receive payment is established,\nfuture economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Company and the amount\nof the dividend can be measured reliably.\n(7) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\nA. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income comprise equity securities\nwhich are not held for trading, and for which the Company has made an irrevocable election at\ninitial recognition to recognise changes in fair value in other comprehensive income and debt\ninstruments which meet all of the following criteria:\n(a) The objective of the Company’s business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash\nflows and selling financial assets; and\n(b) The assets’ contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\nB. On a regular way purchase or sale basis, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive\nincome are recognised and derecognised using trade date accounting.\nC. At initial recognition, the Company measures the financial assets at fair value plus transaction\ncosts. The Company subsequently measures the financial assets at fair value:\n(a) The changes in fair value of equity investments that were recognised in other comprehensive\nincome are reclassified to retained earnings and are not reclassified to profit or loss following\nthe derecognition of the investment. Dividends are recognised as revenue when the right to\nreceive payment is established, future economic benefits associated with the dividend will\nflow to the Company and the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.\n(b) Except for the recognition of impairment loss, interest income and gain or loss on foreign\nexchange which are recognised in profit or loss, the changes in fair value of debt instruments\nare taken through other comprehensive income. When the financial asset is derecognised, the\ncumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified\nfrom equity to profit or loss.\n~21~\n(8) Financial assets at amortised cost\nA. Financial assets at amortised cost are those that meet all of the following criteria:\n(a) The objective of the Company’s business model is achieved by collecting contractual cash\nflows.\n(b) The assets’ contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\nB. On a regular way purchase or sale basis, financial assets at amortised cost are recognised and\nderecognised using trade date accounting.\nC. At initial recognition, the Company measures the financial assets at fair value plus transaction\ncosts. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective\ninterest method. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or\nimpaired.\nD. The Company’s time deposits which do not fall under cash equivalents are those with a short\nmaturity period and are measured at initial investment amount as the effect of discounting is\nimmaterial.\n(9) Notes, accounts and other receivables\nA. Notes and accounts receivable entitle the Company a legal right to receive consideration in\nexchange for transferred goods or rendered services. Receivables arising from transactions other\nthan the sale of goods or services are classified as other receivables.\nB. The Company initially measures accounts and notes receivable at fair value and subsequently\nrecognises the amortised interest income over the period of circulation using the effective interest\nmethod and the impairment loss. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.\n(10) Impairment of financial assets\nFor debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial\nassets at amortised cost including accounts receivable or contract assets that have a significant\nfinancing component, at each reporting date, the Company recognises the impairment provision for\n12 months expected credit losses if there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial\nrecognition or recognises the impairment provision for the lifetime expected credit losses (ECLs) if\nsuch credit risk has increased since initial recognition after taking into consideration all reasonable\nand verifiable information that includes forecasts. On the other hand, for accounts receivable or\ncontract assets that do not contain a significant financing component, the Company recognises the\nimpairment provision for lifetime ECLs.\n(11) Derecognition of financial assets\nThe Company derecognises a financial asset when one of the following conditions is met:\nA. The contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset expire.\nB. The contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have been transferred and\nthe Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial\nasset.\nC. The contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have been transferred;\nhowever, the Company has not retained control of the financial asset.\n~22~\n(12) Leasing arrangements (lessor)-operating leases\nLease income from an operating lease (net of any incentives given to the lessee) is recognised in profit\nor loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n(13) Inventories\nInventories refer to fuel inventories and steel inventories. Fuel inventories are physically measured\nby the crew of each ship and reported back to the Head Office through telegraph for recording\npurposes at balance sheet date. Valuation of inventories is based on the exchange rate prevailing at\nbalance sheet date.\n(14) Investments accounted for using equity method / subsidiaries and associates\nA. Subsidiary is an entity where the Company has the right to dominate its finance and operation\npolicies (includes special purpose entity), normally the Company owns more than 50 percent of\nthe voting rights directly or indirectly in that entity. Subsidiaries are accounted for under the\nequity method in the Company's parent company only financial statements.\nB. Unrealized gains or losses resulted from inter-company transactions with subsidiaries are\neliminated. Necessary adjustments are made to the accounting policies of subsidiaries, to be\nconsistent with the accounting policies of the Company.\nC. After acquisition of subsidiaries, the Company recognizes proportionately for the share of profit\nand loss and other comprehensive incomes in the income statement as part of the Company's\nprofit and loss and other comprehensive income, respectively. When the share of loss from a\nsubsidiary exceeds the carrying amount of Company's interests in that subsidiary, the Company\ncontinues to recognize its shares in the subsidiary's loss proportionately.\nD. Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are\naccounted for as equity transactions. Any difference between the amount by which the non-\ncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received shall be\nrecognized directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.\nE. If the Company loses control of a subsidiary, the Company recognizes any investment retained\nin the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost and recognizes any\nresulting difference as a gain or loss in profit or loss. The Company shall account for all amounts\nrecognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary on the same basis as\nwould be required if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\nTherefore, if a gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income would be\nreclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Company\nreclassifies the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss when it loses control of the subsidiary.\nF. Associates are all entities over which the Company has significant influence but not control. In\ngeneral, it is presumed that the investor has significant influence, if an investor holds, directly or\nindirectly 20 percent or more of the voting power of the investee. Investments in associates are\naccounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.\n~23~\nG. The Company’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit\nor loss, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised\nin other comprehensive income. When the Company’s share of losses in an associate equals or\nexceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Company\ndoes not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred constructive obligations or made\npayments on behalf of the associate.\nH. When changes in an associate’s equity do not arise from profit or loss or other comprehensive\nincome of the associate and such changes do not affect the Company’s ownership percentage of\nthe associate, the Company recognises in ‘capital surplus’ in proportion to its ownership.\nI. Unrealised gains or loss on transactions between the Company and its associates are eliminated\nto the extent of the Company’s interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated\nunless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting\npolicies of associates have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies\nadopted by the Company.\nJ. In the case that an associate issues new shares and the Company does not subscribe or acquire\nnew shares proportionately, which results in a change in the Company’s ownership percentage\nof the associate but maintains significant influence on the associate, then ‘capital surplus’ and\n‘investments accounted for under the equity method’ shall be adjusted for the increase or decrease\nof its share of equity interest. If the above condition causes a decrease in the Company’s\nownership percentage of the associate, in addition to the above adjustment, the amounts\npreviously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate are reclassified\nto profit or loss proportionately on the same basis as would be required if the relevant assets or\nliabilities were disposed of.\nK. Upon loss of significant influence over an associate, the Company remeasures any investment\nretained in the former associate at its fair value. Any difference between fair value and carrying\namount is recognised in profit or loss.\nL. When the Company disposes its investment in an associate and loses significant influence over\nthis associate, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to\nthe associate, are reclassified to profit or loss, on the same basis as would be required if the\nrelevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. If it retains significant influence over this associate,\nthe amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate\nare reclassified to profit or loss proportionately in accordance with the aforementioned approach.\nM. When the Company disposes its investment in an associate and loses significant influence over\nthis associate, the amounts previously recognised as capital surplus in relation to the associate\nare transferred to profit or loss. If it retains significant influence over this associate, the amounts\npreviously recognised as capital surplus in relation to the associate are transferred to profit or\nloss proportionately.\n~24~\nN. According to “Regulations Governing the Preparations of Financial Statements by Securities\nIssuers”, 'profit for the year' and 'other comprehensive income for the year' reported in an entity's\nparent company only statement of comprehensive income, shall equal to 'profit for the year' and\n'other comprehensive income' attributable to owners of the parent reported in that entity's\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income. Total equity reported in an entity's parent\ncompany only financial statements, shall equal to equity attributable to owners of parent reported\nin that entity's consolidated financial statements.\n(15) Property, plant and equipment\nA. Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Borrowing costs incurred during the\nconstruction period are capitalised.\nB. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as\nappropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will\nflow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of\nthe replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss\nduring the financial period in which they are incurred.\nC. Land is not depreciated. Other property, plant and equipment apply cost model and are\ndepreciated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost over their estimated useful lives.\nEach part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation\nto the total cost of the item must be depreciated separately.\nD. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if\nappropriate, at each financial year-end. If expectations for the assets’ residual values and useful\nlives differ from previous estimates or the patterns of consumption of the assets’ future economic\nbenefits embodied in the assets have changed significantly, any change is accounted for as a\nchange in estimate under IAS 8, ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and\nErrors’, from the date of the change. The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment\nare as follows:\nBuildings (Including repairment) uipme 3 ~ 55 years\nLoading and unloading equipment Transportation equipment 5 ~ 20 years\n..\nShips ( Except for docking repair, ballast water, . ...8 ~ 25 years\nlashing gears equipment and scrubber) rans 1\nShips (Docking repair) rans 2 ~ 5 years\n.\nShips (Ballast water, lashing gears equipment .6 ~10 years\nand scrubber)sportation equipment .\nTransportation equipment 6 ~ 10 years\nLease improvements . 3 ~ 20 years\nOther equipment 2 ~ 5 years\n.. .\nThe above docking repair, ballast water, lashing gears equipment and scrubbers are significant\ncomponents of ships.\n~25~\n(16) Leasing arrangements (lessee)－right-of-use assets/ lease liabilities\nA. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at\nwhich the leased asset is available for use by the Company. For short-term leases or leases of\nlow-value assets, lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term.\nB. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the remaining lease payments at the\ncommencement date, discounted using the incremental borrowing interest rate.\nLease payments are comprised of the following:\n(a) Fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;\n(b) Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate; and\n(c) The exercise price of a purchase option, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that\noption.\nThe Company subsequently measures the lease liability at amortised cost using the interest\nmethod and recognises interest expense over the lease term. The lease liability is remeasured and\nthe amount of remeasurement is recognised as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset when there\nare changes in the lease term or lease payments and such changes do not arise from contract\nmodifications.\nC. At the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is stated at cost comprising the following:\n(a) The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n(b) Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date;\n(c) Any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and\n(d) An estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying\nasset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition\nrequired by the terms and conditions of the lease.\nThe right-of-use asset is measured subsequently using the cost model and is depreciated from the\ncommencement date to the earlier of the end of the asset’s useful life or the end of the lease term.\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, the amount of remeasurement is recognised as an\nadjustment to the right-of-use asset.\nD. For lease modifications that decrease the scope of the lease, the lessee shall decrease the carrying\namount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease, and recognise\nthe difference between remeasured lease liability in profit or loss.\n(17) Investment property\nAn investment property is stated initially at its cost and measured subsequently using the cost model.\nExcept for land, investment property is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful\nlife of 50 ~ 55 years.\n(18) Intangible assets\nComputer software is stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful\nlife of 2-5 years.\n~26~\n(19) Impairment of non-financial assets\nThe Company assesses at each balance sheet date the recoverable amounts of those assets where\nthere is an indication that they are impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by\nwhich the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the\nhigher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell or value in use. When the circumstances or reasons\nfor recognizing impairment loss for an asset in prior years no longer exist or diminish, the\nimpairment loss is reversed. The increased carrying amount due to reversal should not be more than\nwhat the depreciated or amortised historical cost would have been if the impairment had not been\nrecognised.\n(20) Borrowings\nA.Borrowings comprise long-term and short-term bank borrowings and other long-term and short-\nterm loans. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.\nBorrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net\nof transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the period of\nthe borrowings using the effective interest method.\nB. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to\nthe extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the\nfee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable\nthat some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for\nliquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.\n(21) Accounts payable\nA. Accounts payable are liabilities for purchases of raw materials, goods or services.\nB. The Company initially measures accounts payable at fair value and subsequently amortises the\ninterest expense in profit or loss over the period of circulation using the effective interest method.\n(22) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\nA. Financial liabilities are classified in this category of held for trading if acquired principally for\nthe purpose of repurchasing in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as financial\nliabilities held for trading unless they are designated as hedges or financial liabilities at fair value\nthrough profit or loss. Financial liabilities that meet one of the following criteria are designated\nas at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition:\n(a) Hybrid (combined) contracts; or\n(b) They eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency; or\n(c) They are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with\na documented risk management policy.\nB. At initial recognition, the Company measures the financial liabilities at fair value. All related\ntransaction costs are recognised in profit or loss. The Company subsequently measures these\nfinancial liabilities at fair value with any gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.\n~27~\n(23) Bonds payable\nOrdinary corporate bonds issued by the Company are initially recognised at fair value less\ntransaction costs. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption\nvalue is presented as an addition to or deduction from bonds payable, which is amortised to profit\nor loss over the period of bond circulation using the effective interest method as an adjustment to\n‘finance costs’.\n(24) Convertible bonds payable (Compound financial instruments)\nConvertible bonds issued by the Group contain conversion options (that is, the bondholders have\nthe right to convert the bonds into the Group’s common shares by exchanging a fixed amount of\ncash for a fixed number of common shares), call options and put options. The Group classifies the\nbonds payable upon issuance as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in\naccordance with the contract terms. They are accounted for as follows:\nA. The embedded call options and put options are recognised initially at net fair value as ‘financial\nassets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss’. They are subsequently\nremeasured and stated at fair value on each balance sheet date; the gain or loss is recognised as\n‘gain or loss on valuation of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or\nloss’.\nB. The host contracts of bonds are initially recognised at fair value. Any difference between the\ninitial recognition and the redemption value is accounted for as the premium or discount on bonds\npayable and subsequently is amortised in profit or loss as an adjustment to ‘finance costs’ over\nthe period of circulation using the effective interest method.\nC. The embedded conversion options which meet the definition of an equity instrument are initially\nrecognised in ‘capital surplus—share options’ at the residual amount of total issue price less the\namount of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and bonds\npayable as stated above. Conversion options are not subsequently remeasured.\nD. Any transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance are allocated to each liability or equity\ncomponent in proportion to the initial carrying amount of each abovementioned item.\nE. When bondholders exercise conversion options, the liability component of the bonds (including\nbonds payable and ‘financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss’)\nshall be remeasured on the conversion date. The issuance cost of converted common shares is\nthe total book value of the abovementioned liability component and ‘capital surplus—share\noptions’.\n(25) Derecognition of financial liabilities\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is either discharged\nor cancelled or expires.\n(26) Offsetting financial instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and reported in the net amount in the balance sheet when\nthere is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle\non a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n~28~\n(27) Hedge accounting\nA. At the inception of the hedging relationship, there is formal designation and documentation of\nthe hedging relationship and the Company’s risk management objective and strategy for\nundertaking the hedge. That documentation shall include identification of the hedging instrument,\nthe hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Company will assess whether\nthe hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.\nB. The Company designates the hedging relationship as follows:\nCash flow hedge:\nA hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk\nassociated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.\nC. Cash flow hedges\n(a)The cash flow hedge reserve associated with the hedged item is adjusted to the lower of the\nfollowing (in absolute amounts):\ni. the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge; and\nii. the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge.\n(b)The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other\ncomprehensive income. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the ineffective\nportion is recognised in profit or loss.\n(c)The amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance with (a)\nis accounted for as follows:\ni. If a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial\nasset or non-financial liability, or a hedged forecast transaction for a non-financial asset\nor non-financial liability becomes a firm commitment for which fair value hedge\naccounting is applied, the Company shall remove that amount from the cash flow hedge\nreserve and include it directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or\nliability.\nii. For cash flow hedges other than those covered by item i. above, that amount shall be\nreclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification\nadjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash\nflows affect profit or loss.\niii. If that amount is a loss and the Company expects that all or a portion of that loss will not\nbe recovered in one or more future periods, it shall immediately reclassify the amount that\nis not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.\n(d) When the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, exercised or when the hedging\nrelationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria, if the forecast transaction is still expected\nto occur, the amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve shall remain\nin the cash flow hedge reserve until the forecast transaction occurs; if the forecast transaction\nis no longer expected to occur, the amount shall be immediately reclassified from the cash\nflow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.\n~29~\n(28) Employee benefits\nA. Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected\nto be paid in respect of service rendered by employees in a period and should be recognised as\nexpense in that period when the employees render service.\nB. Pensions\n(a) Defined contribution plans\nFor defined contribution plans, the contributions are recognised as pension expense when\nthey are due on an accrual basis. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent\nof a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments.\n(b) Defined benefit plans\ni. Net obligation under a defined benefit plan is defined as the present value of an amount\nof pension benefits that employees will receive on retirement for their services with the\nCompany in current period or prior periods. The liability recognised in the balance sheet\nin respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit\nobligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The net defined\nbenefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit\ncredit method. The rate used to discount is determined by using interest rates of high-\nquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will\nbe paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension\nliability; when there is no deep market in high-quality corporate bonds, the Company uses\ninterest rates of government bonds (at the balance sheet date) instead.\nii. Remeasurements arising on defined benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive\nincome in the period in which they arise and are recorded as retained earnings.\niii. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nC. Termination benefits\nTermination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of\nemployment as a result from either the Company’s decision to terminate an employee’s\nemployment before the normal retirement date, or an employee’s decision to accept an offer of\nredundancy benefits in exchange for the termination of employment. The Company recognises\nexpense as it can no longer withdraw an offer of termination benefits or it recognises relating\nrestructuring costs, whichever is earlier. Benefits that are expected to be due more than 12\nmonths after balance sheet date shall be discounted to their present value.\n~30~\nD. Employees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration\nEmployees’ compensation and directors’ remuneration are recognised as expense and liability,\nprovided that such recognition is required under legal or constructive obligation and those\namounts can be reliably estimated. Any difference between the resolved amounts and the\nsubsequently actual distributed amounts is accounted for as changes in estimates. If employee\ncompensation is paid by shares, the Company calculates the number of shares based on the\nclosing price at the previous day of the board meeting resolution.\n(29) Income tax\nA. The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or\nloss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or\nitems recognised directly in equity, in which cases the tax is recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or equity.\nB. The current income tax expense is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively\nenacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate\nand generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns\nwith respect to situations in accordance with applicable tax regulations. It establishes provisions\nwhere appropriate based on the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. An additional\ntax is levied on the unappropriated retained earnings and is recorded as income tax expense in\nthe year the stockholders resolve to retain the earnings.\nC. Deferred income tax is recognised, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary\ndifferences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in\nthe parent company only balance sheet. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences\narising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of\nthe temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary\ndifference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax is determined using tax\nrates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are\nexpected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income\ntax liability is settled.\nD. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit\nwill be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. At each balance sheet\ndate, unrecognised and recognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed.\nE. Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance\nsheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an\nintention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred\nincome tax assets and liabilities are offset on the balance sheet when the entity has the legally\nenforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and they are levied by\nthe same taxation authority on either the same entity or different entities that intend to settle on a\nnet basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n~31~\nF. A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carryforward of unused tax credits resulting from\nacquisitions of equipment or technology, research and development expenditures and equity\ninvestments to the extent that it is possible that future taxable profit will be available against which\nthe unused tax credits can be utilised.\n(30) Dividends\nDividends are recorded in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which they are\nresolved by the Company’s shareholders. Cash dividends are recorded as liabilities; stock dividends\nare recorded as stock dividends to be distributed and are reclassified to ordinary shares on the\neffective date of new shares issuance.\n(31) Revenue recognition\nA. Sales of services\nRevenue from delivering services is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method\nwhen the outcome of services provided can be estimated reliably. The stage of completion of a\nservice contract is measured by the percentage of the number of days the vessel has sailed as of\nthe financial reporting date to the total number of days to sail. If the outcome of a service contract\ncannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue should be recognised only to the extent that\ncontract costs incurred are likely to be recoverable. The customer pays at the time specified in\nthe payment schedule. If the services rendered exceed the payment, a contract asset is recognised.\nIf the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognised.\nB. Rental revenue\nThe Company leases ships and shipping spaces under IFRS 16, ‘Leases’. Lease assets are\nclassified as finance leases or operating leases based on the transferred proportion of the risks\nand rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset, and recognised in revenue over the lease\nterm.\n(32) Government grants\nGovernment grants are recognised at their fair value only when there is reasonable assurance that\nthe Company will comply with any conditions attached to the grants and the grants will be received.\nGovernment grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which\nthe Company recognises expenses for the related costs for which the grants are intended to\ncompensate.\n~32~\n(33) Business combinations\nA. The Company uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The\nconsideration transferred for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred,\nliabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued at the acquisition date, plus the fair\nvalue of any assets and liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. All\nacquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and\ncontingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values\nat the acquisition date. For each business combination, the Company measures at the acquisition\ndate components of non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests\nand entitle their holders to the proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of\nliquidation at either fair value or the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the\nrecognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. All other non-controlling interests\nshould be measured at the acquisition-date fair value.\nB. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the\nacquiree and the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of\nthe identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill at the\nacquisition date. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest in the acquiree\nrecognised and the fair value of previously held equity interest in the acquiree is less than the\nfair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, the difference is\nrecognised directly in profit or loss on the acquisition date.\n(34) Operating segments\nThe Company’s operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting\nprovided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker. The Chief Operating Decision-Maker is\nresponsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.\n5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND KEY SOURCES OF ASSUMPTION\nUNCERTAINTY\nThe preparation of these parent company only financial statements requires management to make critical\njudgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies and make critical assumptions and estimates\nconcerning future events. Assumptions and estimates may differ from the actual results and are\ncontinually evaluated and adjusted based on historical experience and other factors. Such assumptions\nand estimates have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities within the next financial year; and the related information is addressed below:\n~33~\n(1) Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies\nLease term\nIn determining the lease term, the Company takes into consideration all facts and circumstances that\ncreate an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not to exercise a termination option,\nincluding the expected changes of all fact and situation for the period from the commencement date\nof lease to the execution date of options. Also, the Company took into consideration the main factors,\nsuch as the contract terms and conditions during the option covered period and the importance to\nlessee’s operation if the significant lease improvement and underlying assets incurred during the\ncontract terms. When significant events or significant changes occur within the Company’s control,\nthe lease term will be re-estimated.\n(2) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company and the subsidiaries, Peony Investment S.A., Evergreen Marine (Asia) Pte. Ltd. and\nEvergreen Marine (Hong Long) Ltd., which are recognized in investments accounted for using equity\nmethod, primarily engages in global container shipping service covering ocean-going and near-sea\nshipping line. Despite the Company conducting business worldwide, its transactions are all in small\namounts, whereas the freight rate is subject to fluctuation caused by cargo loading rate as well as\nmarket competition. Worldwide shipping agencies use a system to record the transactions by entering\ndata including shipping departure, destination, counterparty, transit time, shipping amounts, and\nfreight price for the Company. Therefore, management could recognize freight revenue in accordance\nwith the data on bill of lading reports generated from the system, accompanied by estimation made\nfrom past experience and current cargo loading conditions the revenue that would flow in. Also,\ndemands for freight are consistently sent by forwarders during voyage. Due to the factors mentioned\nabove, freight revenue is recognized under the percentage-of-completion method for each vessel\nduring the reporting period. As the process of recording transactions, communicating with agencies,\nand maintaining the system are done manually, and the estimation of freight revenue are subject to\nmanagement’s judgement. Given the conditions mentioned above, we consider the accuracy of freight\nrevenue and the appropriate use of cut-off by the Company and its investee companies as a key audit\nmatter.\n6. DETAILS OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTS\n(1) Cash and cash equivalents\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCash on hand and petty cash $ 6 5,450 $ 7 7,912\nChecking accounts and demand deposits 6,353,012 5,682,874\nTime deposits 8,353,143 121,560,745\n$ 14,771,605 $ 127,321,531\nA. The Company transacts with a variety of financial institutions all with high credit quality to\ndisperse credit risk, so it expects that the probability of counterparty default is remote.\nB. The Company has no cash and cash equivalents pledged to others.\n~34~\n(2) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\nItems December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNon-current items:\nListed (TSE and OTC) stocks $ 490,801 $ 490,801\nUnlisted stocks 8 9,521 9 1,058\n5 80,322 5 81,859\nValuation adjustment 8 44,970 4 48,984\n$ 1,425,292 $ 1,030,843\nA. The Company has elected to classify these investments that are considered to be strategic\ninvestments as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.

On June 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to dispose the Company’s\nequity interest in EVA through stock exchange market, and the number of shares and the amounts\nsettled on August 14, 2023 and August 21, 2023 totalled 375,402 thousand shares and $13,046,838,\nrespectively, resulting in an aggregate gain of disposal of $6,260,209. After the disposal and due\nto the conversion of EVA’s convertible bonds into stocks during the twelve-month period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company’s share interest in EVA decreased to 7.43% as of December 31,\n2023.\nI. .Considering that Evergreen Steel Corp. generates stable profits from its main business and the\noutlook of the environmental protection and green energy industry in which Evergreen Steel Corp.\nreinvests is promising, on November 4, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to\nacquire the equity interest in Evergreen Steel Corp. through stock exchange market to purchase\n79,248 thousand shares at a price of $48.20 per share and acquire 19% equity interests in the entity\nand the transaction price amounted to $3,819,754.\nJ. On March 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to acquire 31% equity\ninterests in ESRC from the associate, EVA. Together with 31.25% equity interests previously held\nby the Company, the Company held a total of 62.25% equity interests in ESRC after the merger\nand obtained control over ESRC. The transaction date was April 1, 2022 and the transaction\namount was $192,038.\nK. The Company is the single largest shareholder of EITC with a 40.36% equity interest. Given that\nthe main source of economic profits of EITC is generated from Evergreen Line, the percentage of\noperating volume of the Group in Evergreen Line is equivalent to other related parties’ and there\nis no agreement between other related parties and the Company to make decisions in consultation\nor collectively; however, in order to maintain the equity balance between the Group and other\nrelated parties, the Company governs EITC with other related parties to maintain mutual and other\nshareholders’ best interests; apart from independent directors, the number of seats held by the\nCompany on the Board are the same as other related parties’, which indicates that the Group has\nno current ability to direct the relevant activities of EITC, thus, the Group has no control, but only\nhas significant influence, over the investee.\nL. The Company is the single largest shareholder of TPCT with a 27.85% equity interest.

Financial risk management policies\n(a)The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign\nexchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s\noverall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and\nseeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Company’s financial position and financial\nperformance.\n(b)Risk management is carried out by the Company’s Finance Department under policies\napproved by the Board of Directors. The Company’s Finance Department identifies, evaluates\nand hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Company’s Operating Department.\nThe Board of Directors provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as\nwritten policies covering specific areas and matters, such as foreign exchange risk, interest\nrate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial\ninstruments, and investment of excess liquidity.\nC. Significant financial risks and degrees of financial risks\n(a) Market risk\nForeign exchange risk\ni. The Company operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from\nvarious currency exposures, primarily with respect to the USD. Foreign exchange risk\narises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net\ninvestment in foreign operations.\nii. The Company’s management has set up a policy to require group companies to manage\ntheir foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. The group companies are\nrequired to hedge their entire foreign exchange risk exposure with the Company’s Finance\nDepartment. To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial\ntransactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Company use forward\nforeign exchange contracts, transacted with Company’s Finance Department.

Analysis of foreign currency market risk arising from significant foreign exchange variation:\nPrice risk\ni. The Company is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the\nCompany and classified on the balance sheet at fair value through other comprehensive\nincome. The Company is not exposed to commodity price risk. To manage its price risk\narising from investments in equity securities, the Company diversifies its portfolio.\nDiversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the Company.\nii. The Company’s investments in equity securities comprise domestic listed and unlisted\nstocks. The prices of equity securities would change due to the change of the future value\nof investee companies. If the prices of these equity securities had increased/decreased by\n1% with all other variables held constant, equity would have increased/decreased by\n$14,140 and $10,209 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as a\nresult of other comprehensive income classified as equity investment at fair value through\nother comprehensive income.\n~87~\n(\nF\nF\nF o r e ig n c u r r e n\nin a n c ia l a s s e t s\nM o n e t a r y it e m\nU S D : N T D\nJ Y P : N T Din\na n c ia l lia b ilit\nM o n e t a r y it e m\nU S D : N T D\nI N R : N T D\nc y\ns\nie\ns\n:\ns\nf u n c t io n a l c u r r e n c y )\nDv ea g rr\nia\n1 %1\n%\n1 %1\n%\nY\net\ne\ne\nio\na\non\nr\nf\ne n\nS\nd\ne\ne d D e c e m b e\nn s it iv it y a n a\nE f f e c t o n\np r o f it\no r lo s s\n$ 3 6 8 , 8 4 7\n1 , 3 0 2\n$ 2 6 5 , 2 5 6\n1 , 7 5 2\nr\nly\n3 1 , 2 0 2 3\ns is\nE f f e c t o n o t h e r\nc o m p r e h e n s iv e\nin c o m e\n$ 4 5 , 2 6 8\n-\n$ 1 5 0 , 8 6 1\n-\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nSensitivity analysis\nEffect on Effect on other\nDegree of profit comprehensive\nvariation or loss income\n(Foreign currency: functional currency)\nFinancial assets\nMonetary items\nUSD:NTD 1% $ 311,171 $ 8 4,613\nFinancial liabilities\nMonetary items\nUSD:NTD 1% $ 356,203 $ 168,757\nCash flow and fair value interest rate risk\ni. The Company’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at\nvariable rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially offset\nby cash and cash equivalents held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose\nthe Company to fair value interest rate risk. During the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the Company’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in the NTD and\nUSD.\nii. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, if interest rates on borrowings had been 1% higher/lower\nwith all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022 would have been $87,449 and $35,555 lower/higher, respectively, mainly\nas a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.\n(b) Credit risk\ni. Credit risk refers to the risk of financial loss to the Company arising from default by the\nclients or counterparties of financial instruments on the contract obligations. The main\nfactor is that counterparties could not repay in full the accounts receivable based on the\nagreed terms.\nii. The Company manages their credit risk taking into consideration the entire group’s concern.\nAccording to the Company’s credit policy, each local entity in the Company is responsible\nfor managing and analysing the credit risk for each of their clients before standard payment\nand delivery terms and conditions are offered. Internal risk control assesses the credit\nquality of the customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and\nother factors.\niii. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with good credit rating\nare accepted.\niv. The Company adopts following assumptions under IFRS 9 to assess whether there has been\na significant increase in credit risk on that instrument since initial recognition:\nIf the contract payments were past due over 30 days based on the terms, there has been a\nsignificant increase in credit risk on that instrument since initial recognition.\nv. The default occurs when the contract payments are past due over 30 days.\nvi. The following indicators are used to determine whether the credit impairment of debt\ninstruments has occurred:\n(i) It becomes probable that the issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation\ndue to their financial difficulties;\n(ii) The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial\ndifficulties;\n(iii) Default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments;\n(iv) Adverse changes in national or regional economic conditions that are expected to cause\na default.\n~88~\nvii. The Company classifies customer’s accounts receivable and contract assets in accordance\nwith geographic area. The Company applies the modified approach based on the loss rate\nmethodology to estimate expected credit loss.\nviii. The Company wrote-off the financial assets, which cannot be reasonably expected to be\nrecovered, after initiating recourse procedures. However, the Company will continue\nexecuting the recourse procedures to secure their rights. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe Company has no written-off financial assets that are still under recourse procedures.\nix. The Company used the forecastability to adjust historical and timely information to assess\nthe default possibility of notes receivable, accounts receivable (including related parties),\ncontract assets and overdue receivables. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, the loss rate\nmethodology is as follows:\nNotes receivable\nTotal book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nAt December 31, 2023\nNot past due $ 4,010 0% $ -\nAccounts receivable\n(including related parties)\nTotal book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nAt December 31, 2023\nNot past due $ 3,925,145 0% $ -\nUp to 30 days 348,760 0.01% 35\n31 to 180 days 1,029 0.015%~0.03% -\n$ 4,274,934 $ 35\nContract assets\nTotal book value Expected loss rate Loss allowance\nAt December 31, 2023\nNot past due $ 256,652 0% $ -\n~89~\nx. Movements in relation to the Company applying the modified approach to provide loss\nallowance for accounts receivable (including related parties), contract assets and overdue\nreceivables are as follows:\n(c) Liquidity risk\ni. Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Company and aggregated\nby Company’s Finance Department.

A market is regarded as active where a market\nin which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and\nvolume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The fair value of the\nCompany’s investment in listed stocks, beneficiary certificates and derivative\ninstruments with quoted market prices is included in Level.\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset\nor liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nB.

The inputs used in\nthe valuation method to measure these financial instruments are normally observable in the\nmarket.\niv. The valuation of derivative financial instruments is based on valuation model widely\naccepted by market participants, such as present value techniques and option pricing models.\nForward exchange contracts are usually valued based on the current forward exchange rate.\nStructured interest derivative instruments are measured by using appropriate option pricing\nmodels (i.e. Black-Scholes model) or other valuation methods, such as Monte Carlo\nsimulation.\nv. The output of valuation model is an estimated value and the valuation technique may not\nbe able to capture all relevant factors of the Company’s financial and non-financial\ninstruments. Therefore, the estimated value derived using valuation model is adjusted\naccordingly with additional inputs, for example, model risk or liquidity risk and etc. In\naccordance with the Company’s management policies and relevant control procedures\nrelating to the valuation models used for fair value measurement, management believes\nadjustment to valuation is necessary in order to reasonably represent the fair value of\nfinancial and non-financial instruments at the parent company only balance sheet. The\ninputs and pricing information used during valuation are carefully assessed and adjusted\nbased on current market conditions.\nvi. The Company takes into account adjustments for credit risks to measure the fair value of\nfinancial and non-financial instruments to reflect credit risk of the counterparty and the\nCompany’s credit quality.\nE. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no transfer between Level 1 and\nLevel 2.\n~94~\nF. The following chart is the movement of Level 3 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nG. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no transfer into or out from Level 3.\nH. The Company is in charge of valuation procedures for fair value measurements being categorised\nwithin Level 3, which is to verify independent fair value of financial instruments. Such\nassessment is to ensure the valuation results are reasonable by applying independent information\nto make results close to current market conditions, confirming the resource of information is\nindependent, reliable and in line with other resources and represented as the exercisable price,\nand frequently calibrating valuation model, performing back-testing, updating inputs used to the\nvaluation model and making any other necessary adjustments to the fair value.\nI. The following is the qualitative information of significant unobservable inputs and sensitivity\nanalysis of changes in significant unobservable inputs to valuation model used in Level 3 fair\nvalue measurement:\n~95~\nAG\nP\nA\nN\nt J a n u a r y 1a\nin s a n d lo\nc o m p r e h e nr\no c e e d s f r o\nt D e c e m b e\no t e : R e c o r\nin s t r u\ns s e s r e c o g n is e d in o t h e r\ns iv e in c o m e ( N o t e )m\nc a p it a l r e d u c t io n in t h e\nr 3 1\nd e d a s u n r e a lis e d v a lu a t io\nm e n t s m e a s u r e d a t f a ir v a\ny e\nn g\nlu e\na\na\nt\nr\nin\nh r\no\no\nr\nu g\nlo\nh\n2 0 2 3\n$ 1 8 3\n9 5(\n1\n$ 2 7 7\ns s o n v a lu a t io n o\no t h e r c o m p r e h e n\n, 1 1\n, 8 3,\n5 3\n, 4 0\nf in\ns iv\n3\n27\n8\nv\ne\n)\ne s\nin\n$\n$\nt m\nc\n2 0 2 2\n1 4\n3\n1 8\ne n t s in e q u it y\no m e .\n7\n5\n3\n, 3\n, 7\n, 1\n9\n1\n1\n9\n4\n-\n3\nFair value at Significant Range\nDecember Valuation unobservable (weighted Relationship of inputs\n31, 2023 technique input average) to fair value\nNon-derivative equity\ninstrument:\nMarket Price to The higher the multiple\nUnlisted shares $ 269,098 comparable earnings ratio 18.37~34.78 and control premium,\ncompanies multiple the higher the fair value\nThe higher the multiple\nPrice to book\n1.50~3.97 and control premium,\nratio multiple\nthe higher the fair value\nThe higher the\nDiscount for weighted average cost\n20%~\nlack of of capital and discount\n30%\nmarketability for lack of control, the\nlower the fair value\nVenture capital shares\nNet asset Not\nPrivate equity fund 6,772 Not applicable\nvalue applicable\ninvestment\nJ.

If left unchecked, this ratio may increase to 15% by 2050. In response, Evergreen Marine Corp. has developed strategies to support sustainable operations and set targets for CO2 reduction. A 50% reduction by 2030 is planned, compared to 2008 as the baseline. Evergreen aims to be Net Zero by 2050. These objectives are at the heart of Evergreen's global climate action.\n\n[How to do](https://csr.evergreen-marine.com\n/csr/jsp/CSR_EnergyEmissionManagement.jsp) [Carbon Emission Calculator](/emc/calculator/jsp/EMC_CarbonCalculator.jsp?lang=en)\n\n## Notices and News\n\nPrevious Next\n\n[Read more](/emc/latestnews/jsp/EMC_NoticesAndNews.jsp?lang=en)\n\n## Offices and Agents\n\nEvergreen Line provides services globally, you can easily find our office/agent where you interest within clicks.
