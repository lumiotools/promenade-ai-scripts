Tom has been an invaluable member of our board since going public, and his insights have been instrumental in guiding our company through the public listing process. His deep understanding of our business, gained through years of close collaboration with our management team, makes him uniquely qualified for this role. As a senior member of the leadership team, Tom will ensure continuity in our strategic vision while bringing a fresh perspective to our day-to-day operations. His expertise and leadership will be crucial as we navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in our journey as a public company. ”\n\nBonnie-Jeanne Gerety began working with iLearningEngines as a contractor to run the accounting function for the Company in late 2023. She has run her own financial and accounting advisory firm, GeretyAdvisors LLC since 2019. Ms. Gerety previously served as Chief Financial Officer of Brain Scientific and Piezo Motion and has over 20 years of corporate accounting experience. She began her career in public accounting, spending 16 years at Arthur Andersen, rising to the level of Partner. Ms. Gerety holds a B.S.F.S. from Georgetown University and an M.B.A from the University of South Florida.\n\nThomas Olivier is a Managing Director with Arrowroot Capital and has held this position since March 2021. In addition, from November 2020 to April 2024, Mr. Olivier served as the President and Chief Financial Officer, and the Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Arrowroot Acquisition Corp. Previously, Mr. Olivier was a Managing Director in Houlihan Lokey’s Technology, Media & Telecom (TMT) Group from May 2017 until April 2021. Prior to his time at Houlihan Lokey, Mr. Olivier served as a Managing Director at Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., an investment bank focused on the technology sector which was acquired by Key Bank in 2016, from April 2012 to May 2017. Mr. Olivier holds an undergraduate degree from Boston College and a J.D. from George Washington University.\n\niLearningEngines also announced a delay in the release of its third-quarter 2024 financial results. As previously announced, a Special Committee of the Board of the Directors has been formed to conduct an independent investigation into assertions contained in a recent short seller report (the “Investigation”).\n\nWhile the Investigation is ongoing, based on preliminary information identified by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors during the course of the Investigation, that is subject to change with the completion of the Investigation, (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of iLearningEngines Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as iLearningEngines Inc.), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Holdings”), as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, which were reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 22, 2024 (the “Super 8-K”), (ii) the audited consolidated financial statements of Holdings, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, which were reported in the registration statement on Form S-4 initially filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 5, 2023 and declared effective on February 2, 2024 (the “S-4”), in connection with the Company’s business combination, (iii) the Company’s unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, (iv) Holdings’ unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which were reported in the Super 8-K, and (v) Holdings’ unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, which were reported in the S-4 ((i)-(v) collectively, the “Non-Reliance Period”), as previously filed with the SEC, should no longer be relied upon. At this time, the Company is unable to determine whether it must correct financial statements for the Non-Reliance Period, or if such corrections are necessary, the quantification of such corrections. If the Investigation concludes that financial statements in the Non-Reliance Period must be restated, the Company intends to diligently pursue completion and filing of such restated financial statements as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, the Company is working diligently towards the goal of being in a position to file third-quarter 2024 financial results with the SEC as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the Investigation, but at this time cannot predict with certainty when the preparation and filing of information will be completed.\n\nThe Company will release additional information concerning the Investigation in due course and is committed to taking appropriate measures to improve its internal controls.\n\n**About iLearningEngines**\n\niLearningEngines (Nasdaq: AILE) is a leading Applied AI platform for learning and work automation. iLearningEngines enables Enterprises to rapidly productize and deploy a wide range of AI applications and use cases (AI Engines) at scale.\n\niLearningEngines is powered by proprietary vertical specific AI models and data with a flexible No Code AI canvas to drive rapid out-of-the-box deployment while offering low latency and high levels of data security and compliance.\n\nServing over 1,000 enterprise end customers, iLearningEngines is deployed globally into some of the most demanding vertical markets including Healthcare, Education, Insurance, Retail, Energy, Manufacturing and Public Sector to achieve mission critical outcomes.\n\nFor more information about iLearningEngines, please visit: [www.ilearningengines.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4dQ6oX10orvn32oFmN1icm9fA27s5dOXUhz25voPHNWWVdprE8PFjMh783tpbBpF1lzL3Et9SpwBMJ9VuyS-Ev5n2b20gcXgczS-MYEJTbU=).\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

In this partnership, the GenLab Venture team provides decades of systems integration, open source, and cybersecurity experience to drive down risk and focus on value.\n\nThe two companies will distribute ILE’s low-code AI platform and Knowledge Cloud to Hyperscaler, Telecom Innovation Hubs, Centers of Excellence, and GenLab’s Venture Studio Model further fast-tracking enterprise AI application development and deployment.\n\n“Over the last decade, I have worked to support best practices and DevSecOps principles in highly regulated enterprise. It is why GenLab is a founding member of CoSAI, which has been launched by industry leaders including Google, Nvidia, Microsoft, openAI, AWS and others,” said Daniel Riedel, GenLab Studios Founder and Partner.\n\nThe iLearningEngines Applied AI platform for learning and work automation is known for delivering trusted and secure AI applications and use cases at scale within regulated enterprises such as insurance, healthcare, and education. The platform is powered by vertical-specific AI models, no-code AI canvas, and Knowledge Cloud that provide the technology capabilities and the unit economics that make ILE ideal for organizations that require secure and private clouds. The platform integrates advanced components such as API gateways, AI workflow orchestration, pipelines for large and small language models (LLM, SLM), and multi-modal models for intelligent document extraction and predictive analytics. These features enable faster, more secure deployments and deliver AI fine-tuned specifically for enterprise learning and work automation at scale.\n\n“Global enterprises continue to face challenges in applying generative AI to increase revenue and workforce productivity and do so in a highly secure and trusted fashion. ILE and GenLab believed it was the right time to partner to bring ILE to enterprises looking to scale and automate their AI application development while increasing security, governance, risk management, and compliance,” said Harish Chidambaran, CEO of iLearningEngines.\n\nDaniel continues, “Integrating the best practices guided by CoSAI combined with grounding principles for accurate, dependable AI across Japan, India, and the Americas will empower our strategic alliance partner ILE’s Platform and Knowledge Cloud. With GenLab’s experience in cloud, on-prem, and highly sensitive data environments it’s a perfect match to apply our Venture Studio Model. Together we will dramatically accelerate global enterprises' ability to upskill Generative AI knowledge workers and drive model development at their Centers of Excellence where the best practices and processes are evolving to safeguard enterprise data as prompt engineering and grounding takes off worldwide,” said Daniel Riedel.\n\n“Having worked with OASIS standards for nearly a decade, I want to ensure GenLab Venture Studio is committed to value creation for our portfolio companies. Building AI responsibly means safety and security are paramount to reduce risk to customers and investors.”\n\n**About iLearningEngines:** iLearningEngines (Nasdaq: AILE) is a leading Applied AI platform for learning and work automation. iLearningEngines enables Enterprises to rapidly productize and deploy a wide range of AI applications and use cases (AI Engines) at scale.\n\niLearningEngines is powered by proprietary vertical specific AI models and data with a flexible No Code AI canvas to drive rapid out-of-the-box deployment while offering low latency and high levels of data security and compliance.
