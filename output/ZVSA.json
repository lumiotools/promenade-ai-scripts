Obesity, a top risk factor for strokes, is associated with around one out of five strokes.\n  * Cardiac complications following a stroke are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, second only to acute neurological injury.\n  * The pathomechanism underlying cardiac dysfunction following a stroke includes a surge of catecholamines, such as epinephrine, which induces inflammasome activation triggering a systemic inflammatory response.\n  * The published data showed that following a stroke, Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100 blocked AIM2 inflammasome activation and cell death (pyroptosis) in the heart and improved cardiac function.\n  * Data from this article support ZyVersa’s development of Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100 for obesity and its associated cardiovascular comorbidities.\n\n\n\nWESTON, Fla., Nov. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZyVersa Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZVSA, or “ZyVersa”), a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class drugs for treatment of inflammatory and renal diseases, announces newly published data demonstrating that stroke-related cardiovascular injury and dysfunction is induced by AIM2 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in the heart, which can be blocked by Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100.\n\n“These data demonstrate the potential for IC 100 to attenuate stroke-related cardiovascular disease which is common in patients living with obesity. According to the American Heart Association, obesity-related cardiovascular disease deaths tripled between 1999 and 2020, and this is expected to continue to increase without effective therapeutic options,” said Stephen C. Glover, ZyVersa’s Co-founder, Chairman, CEO and President. “We are excited about the potential of IC 100 to effectively control the inflammation that drives stroke-related cardiovascular injury and dysfunction. Unlike the NLRP3 inhibitors in development, IC 100 targets ASC to inhibit activation of multiple inflammasomes, including AIM2, which triggered the systemic inflammatory response affecting the heart after stroke in this study. More importantly, IC 100 uniquely disrupts the function of ASC specks to attenuate chronic, systemic inflammation leading to comorbidities. We look forward to progressing IC 100’s development program into phase 1 around mid-2025.\n\nThis study was published in the peer-reviewed journal, _Translational Stroke Research_ , by acclaimed inflammasome researchers from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and inventors of IC 100. In the publication titled, [Catecholamine‑Induced Inflammasome Activation in the Heart Following Photothrombotic Stroke](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PPCfWttLprxuswQ8bcV0MSbAuxeKbLAggp0wQwP2JyLKrKLupUISEDKZAuZPpUQQDpz6nGVA1u14YtIdqcmdoQ9hpbXAq7iTGM1ri_1x2t4kkG6sI3PkTMntyJD1WHro5ELP0A4xQm4EP0PNUjWyvjS1lepbZsYz5x5EYREx8XuFmpKZhu6nZF5jTiSffuWwJn4zLlJ_X4GiS_lyUY72X_65UURMKXLI9Omqb4WVs_wXnBi00gxK5dqIhFpYvBya), the researchers report data from studies conducted in a mouse model of photothrombotic stroke (PTS) and in excised zebrafish hearts.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n  * PTS in mice results in activation of the AIM2 inflammasome in the heart resulting in significant increases in IL-1β and ASC oligomerization into ASC specks contributing to a systemic inflammatory response affecting the heart after stroke.\n  * Treatment with IC 100 (30 mg/kg) at 30 minutes post-PTS significantly reduced the levels of inflammasome proteins and IL-1β in the heart thus reducing cardiac inflammation.\n  * Epinephrine-treated zebrafish hearts demonstrated a shortened action potential duration (SAPD) which was attenuated by IC 100. SAPD can cause irregular heart rhythm and reduced cardiac efficiency commonly seen in strokes and heart failure.\n\n\n\n“These findings indicate that stroke initiates a catecholamine surge that induces inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in the heart that is blocked by IC 100, thus providing a framework for the development of therapeutics for stroke-related cardiovascular injury,” stated author Dr. Robert W. Keane, Professor, Physiology and Biophysics, Neurological Surgery and Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n**About Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100**\n\nIC 100 is a novel humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC. IC 100 was designed to attenuate both initiation and perpetuation of the inflammatory response. It does so by binding to a specific region of the ASC component of multiple types of inflammasomes, including NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and Pyrin. Intracellularly, IC 100 binds to ASC monomers, inhibiting inflammasome formation, thereby blocking activation of IL-1β early in the inflammatory cascade. IC 100 also binds to ASC in ASC Specks, both intracellularly and extracellularly, further blocking activation of IL-1β and the perpetuation of the inflammatory response that is pathogenic in inflammatory diseases. Because active cytokines amplify adaptive immunity through various mechanisms, IC 100, by attenuating cytokine activation, also attenuates the adaptive immune response. The lead indication for IC 100 is obesity and its associated metabolic complications.

(Nasdaq: ZVSA, or “ZyVersa”), a clinical-stage specialty biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class drugs for the treatment of renal and inflammatory diseases with high unmet medical needs, reports financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provides business update.\n\n“We are pleased to announce the progress that ZyVersa has made toward achieving our key near-term development milestones,” stated Stephen C. Glover, ZyVersa’s Co-founder, Chairman, CEO, and President. “Our Phase 2a clinical trial with Cholesterol Efflux Mediator™ VAR 200 in diabetic kidney disease is expected to begin Q1-2025, with an initial data read-out around mid-year 2025. In preparation for an IND submission for Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100 and a subsequent Phase 1 trial in healthy overweight subjects at risk for certain metabolic complications, we are initiating two proof-of-concept studies with IC 100 in obesity DIO models. At least one of the studies is expected to begin in Q4-2024. One study will evaluate IC 100 as monotherapy compared to semaglutide, and the other will evaluate IC 100 in combination with semaglutide. Our newly formed Obesity, Metabolic & Inflammatory Disease SAB has been instrumental in designing these two studies to optimize the parameters to be evaluated. We are pleased with the level of scientific evidence from our preclinical program and published third party data that support the potential of IC 100 to control the damaging obesity-driven inflammation and its associated comorbidities. Unlike NLRP3 inhibitors in development for obesity with metabolic complications, IC 100 targets ASC to inhibit multiple inflammasomes, including NLRP3 and AIM2 associated with obesity. More importantly, IC 100 uniquely disrupts the function of ASC specks to attenuate chronic, systemic inflammation leading to obesity comorbidities. We are excited about the promise of our two lead compounds in development to improve health and transform lives. We believe our near-term milestone achievement will be a key inflection point for ZyVersa that will drive shareholder value.” \n\n**BUSINESS UPDATE**\n\n**CHOLESTEROL EFFLUX MEDIATOR™****VAR 200 FOR RENAL DISEASE**\n\nPhase 2a clinical trial in diabetic kidney disease planned to begin Q1-2025.\n\n  * All necessary regulatory preparation has been completed by ZyVersa, our CRO, George Clinical, and our two clinical sites who are gearing up for site initiation and patient recruitment in the new year.\n\n\n\n**INFLAMMASOME ASC INHIBITOR IC 100 FOR OBESITY WITH METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS**\n\nIC 100 IND submission planned for Q2-2025, to be followed by initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy overweight patients at risk for certain metabolic complications. Safety data expected before year end 2025.\n\n  * New Obesity, Metabolic & Inflammatory Disease SAB established to provide expert advice on IC 100’s obesity clinical program. \n    * [SAB](https://www.zyversa.com/about/scientific-advisory-board-inflammatory-diseases) comprised of five top tier experts in the areas of obesity and metabolic diseases, and four world-renowned inflammasome experts and inventors of IC 100 from University of Miami Miller School of Medicine who have provided advisory support for IC 100 since its license.\n\n\n  * Two IC 100 obesity proof-of-concept studies in DIO mouse models designed with expert advice from SAB. \n    * One will evaluate IC 100 monotherapy in comparison to semaglutide, and the other will evaluate IC 100 in combination with semaglutide.\n    * At least one of the DIO model studies is planned to begin Q4-2024.\n    * Data read-outs expected within six months of initiation.\n  * IC 100 GLP toxicology studies are anticipated to begin Q4-2024/Q1-2025\n\n\n\n**THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\nNet losses were approximately $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, with an improvement of approximately $0.5 million or 17.3% compared to a net loss of approximately $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nBased on its current operating plan, ZyVersa expects its cash of approximately $0.1 million as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements on a month-to-month basis. ZyVersa will need additional financing to support its continuing operations and to meet its stated milestones. ZyVersa will seek to fund its operations and clinical activity through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include government grants, collaborations with third parties or outstanding warrant exercises.\n\nResearch and development expenses were approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million or 35.3% from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in the costs of manufacturing, pre-clinical costs for IC 100, and clinical costs for VAR 200.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately $0.4 million or 17.7% from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is attributable to an approximate $0.1 million decrease in professional fees due to reduced fees of public auditors and legal counsel, an approximate $0.2 million decrease in director and officer insurance due to reduced costs in the second year of being a public company, and an approximate $0.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation as a result of options becoming fully amortized in 2024.\n\n**About ZyVersa Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nZyVersa (Nasdaq: ZVSA) is a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company leveraging advanced proprietary technologies to develop first-in-class drugs for patients with inflammatory or kidney diseases with high unmet medical needs.

(Nasdaq: ZVSA, or “ZyVersa”), a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class drugs for treatment of inflammatory and renal diseases, highlights data from an article published in the peer-reviewed _International Journal of Nanomedicine_ titled [Small Intestinal Endocrine Cell Derived Exosomal ACE2 Protects Islet β-Cell Function by Inhibiting the Activation of NLRP3 Inflammasome and Reducing β-Cell Pyroptosis](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qdSGDRtoTpcSRJ8eb85vd6EcLAg-GSejwkEIo-Y1PyQQwpIj3V0xzRrsoaXWeqUg31UGXM9l-gr1KeG9pCRFsvXdytYMDMjPz0OPCnsMCKV21o94Dbvdsy72s31cTAO6oRTRyQry2BNq2aWpcGwMvRbG6M5RWJks4KUA175GEma5a-anqDo8PiDphQYyYrEASGMZt7sSduLGXWnB9ll2CCook8AKPUg-ZoPgsktwrPV-jR5y0jD6uG339jGbfbq_q-H-vtt3AFpBn56bOIRgO4b1i8a3SYah3BI_fwL37-SA3Z0ZqayvWgu8Gx1VTHGVmM2ANFZ66VTP0MQT0mj6YA==) _._ Through investigation on how exosomes derived from gut microbiota can transport signals to remotely regulate pancreatic islet β-cell function, the researchers documented that:\n\n  * Inflammasome-driven inflammation resulted in severely damaged pancreatic islets.\n  * Damaged Islets demonstrated disrupted cellular arrangement and visible vascular thickening, leading to islet cell loss and metabolic dysfunction.\n  * Inflammasome inhibition reduced the inflammation and pancreatic islet damage, and attenuated the metabolic dysfunction.\n\n\n\n“This data supports the potential of Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100, as a key component of obesity care when added to incretins used for weight loss. According to the International Obesity Collaborative, obesity care is about health, not weight. It consists of evidence-based options that address the comorbidities of obesity, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, and improve well-being,” said Stephen C. Glover, ZyVersa’s Co-founder, Chairman, CEO and President. “We are excited about the potential of IC 100 to effectively control the inflammation of obesity. Unlike the NLRP3 inhibitors in development, IC 100 targets ASC to inhibit multiple inflammasomes, including NLRP3 and AIM2, which are activated in obesity. More importantly, IC 100 uniquely disrupts the function of ASC specks to attenuate the chronic, systemic inflammation leading to obesity comorbidities. We look forward to progressing IC 100’s obesity development program into phase 1 around mid-2025.”\n\n**About Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100**\n\nIC 100 is a novel humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC. IC 100 was designed to attenuate both initiation and perpetuation of the inflammatory response. It does so by binding to a specific region of the ASC component of multiple types of inflammasomes, including NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and Pyrin. Intracellularly, IC 100 binds to ASC monomers, inhibiting inflammasome formation, thereby blocking activation of IL-1β early in the inflammatory cascade. IC 100 also binds to ASC in ASC Specks, both intracellularly and extracellularly, further blocking activation of IL-1β and the perpetuation of the inflammatory response that is pathogenic in inflammatory diseases. Because active cytokines amplify adaptive immunity through various mechanisms, IC 100, by attenuating cytokine activation, also attenuates the adaptive immune response. The lead indication for IC 100 is obesity and its associated metabolic complications.
