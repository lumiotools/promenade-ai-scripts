(Nasdaq: PLRX), a late-stage clinical biotechnology company and leader in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, today provided a corporate update and reported third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n“A highlight to this quarter’s progress was the continued strong execution of our BEACON-IPF Phase 2b/3 trial which is enrolling well and on track to complete enrollment in the first quarter of 2025,” said Bernard Coulie, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Pliant. “We are pleased with the interest from the global physician and patient communities in participating in BEACON-IPF and look forward to sharing data in mid-2026. Additionally, we made progress across the portfolio with the goal of bringing potential therapies to patients.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Highlights**\n\n**_Bexotegrast Highlights_**\n\n  * **Enrollment remains on track in BEACON-IPF, a pivotal adaptive Phase 2b/3 trial of bexotegrast in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**. The BEACON-IPF Phase 2b/3 trial is a 52-week, multinational, randomized, dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating bexotegrast at once-daily doses of 160 mg or 320 mg. The Phase 2b portion of BEACON-IPF will enroll 360 patients with IPF. Enrollment in this portion of this trial is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2025 with data anticipated in mid-2026.\n  * **Results from Phase 2a PET imaging target engagement trial published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (AJRCCM).** Also known as the “Blue Journal,” AJRCCM is a leading peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society. The [publication](https://pliantrx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mooney-et-al.-2024-Bexotegrast-shows-dose-dependent-integrin-αvβ6r-receptor-occupancy-in-lungs-of-participants-with-IPF.pdf) reviews the previously reported positive results from an open-label trial in which bexotegrast showed dose-dependent αvβ6 integrin receptor occupancy in lungs of patients with IPF.\n\n\n\n**_Pipeline_**** _Programs_**\n\n  * **Phase 1 trial of PLN-101095 in solid tumors is progressing with dosing of the third of five cohorts.** PLN-101095 is an oral, small molecule, dual selective inhibitor of αvβ8 and αvβ1 integrins designed to block TGF-β activation in the tumor microenvironment. The Company has completed enrollment in the third of five cohorts in the Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation trial. In this trial, PLN-101095 is being tested as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors that are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Preliminary data is expected in early 2025.\n  * **PLN-101325 applications beyond muscular dystrophies.** PLN-101325 is a monoclonal antibody that acts as an allosteric agonist of integrin α7β1, currently in development for treatment of muscular dystrophies. The Company is currently generating additional evidence in support of potential expansion of the scope of PLN-101325 prior to initiating a Phase 1 trial.\n\n\n\n**_Corporate Highlights_**\n\n  * **Appointment of Gary Palmer, M.D. as Senior Vice President of Medical Affairs.** Dr. Palmer brings over 25 years of global leadership experience in medical affairs from biopharmaceutical companies of various sizes and stages, and across multiple therapeutic areas including pulmonary medicine, immunology and neurology. Most recently, Dr. Palmer served as Senior Vice President of Global Medical Affairs, Immunology and Neuroscience at Bristol Myers Squibb.\n\n\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Research and development expenses were $47.8 million, as compared to $32.3 million for the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by BEACON-IPF, a Phase 2b/3 trial of bexotegrast in patients with IPF.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $14.3 million, as compared to $15.3 million for the prior-year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to professional service expenses.\n  * Net loss of $57.8 million as compared to $41.5 million for the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher operating expenses driven by BEACON-IPF.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $406.0 million.\n\n\n\n**About Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nPliant Therapeutics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company and leader in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.

(Nasdaq: PLRX), a late-stage biotechnology company and leader in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, today announced a late-breaking presentation of results from the INTEGRIS-PSC Phase 2a trial of bexotegrast in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) at The Liver Meeting® 2024 of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), in San Diego, California November 15 – 19.

Floyd College of Medicine at Washington State University.\n\n**Late-Breaking Oral Presentation**\n\n**Title:** Bexotegrast, an oral inhibitor of αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins, was shown to improve markers and symptoms of cholestasis and stabilized markers of liver fibrosis in participants with primary sclerosing cholangitis: Week 24 results from the Phase 2 INTEGRIS-PSC trial**Presenter:** Kris Kowdley, M.D.**Session:** Late Breaking Abstract Parallel Session 1**Session Time:** November 18, 2024, 2:00 p.m. - 3:30 p.m. PST**Presentation Time:** November 18, 2024, 3:00 p.m. - 3:15 p.m. PST**Publication Number:** 5004\n\nThe late breaker poster will be made available on the Publications page of the Pliant website at the time of presentation.\n\n**Background on Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis**\n\nPSC is a rare, progressive liver disease of unknown origin, which frequently occurs in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease. PSC affects more than 30,000 patients in the United States and over 100,000 patients worldwide. The disease can occur in all ages, genders, and races. PSC is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis, with progressive liver and biliary damage leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Currently there are no FDA or EMA-approved therapies for patients with PSC. Therefore, there is a high unmet need for new therapeutic options to address the symptoms and modify the disease progression of this grievous illness.\n\n**INTEGRIS-PSC Multinational Phase 2a Trial of Bexotegrast (**[**NCT04480840**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KTXjaqvRxjbZKuBwXgZnY--DSo0skSvzhkJJwQxxsxXbkBv4gJbqA_NQJTLalWGK5s6o2U6qPQLiO2AvVPh69nGQZB5czt50AjONEFS4vJlPutNuOJSjxk4-hSsPY_Vi0Gt3PqLJ23DsRfMoVaV2vg==)**)**\n\nINTEGRIS-PSC was a Phase 2a, randomized, dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of bexotegrast administered over 12 weeks in patients with IPF. Patients were enrolled in doses of 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg or 320 mg, with a 3:1 randomization ratio (active:placebo) and stratification based on use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The primary endpoint was the evaluation of bexotegrast safety and tolerability, and the secondary endpoint is the assessment of pharmacokinetics across the range of doses. Exploratory endpoints measured changes in liver fibrosis markers, enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) and PRO-C3, liver biochemistry and liver imaging.\n\n**About Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nPliant Therapeutics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company and leader in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.
