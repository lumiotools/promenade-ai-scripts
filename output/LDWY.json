ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nby [Investor Relations](https://lendway.com/author/investors/ \"Posts by Investor Relations\") | Nov 19, 2024 | [Press Release](https://lendway.com/category/press-release/)\n\n**MINNEAPOLIS, MN /****November 19, 2024 / Lendway, Inc. (NASDAQ:LDWY)**(“Lendway” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (“Q3”).\n\n**_Overview_**\n\n**Third quarter fiscal year 2024**\n\nNet revenue was $6.6 million.  \n---  \nGross profit was $1.4 million, or 21.7% of sales.  \nOperating loss of $1.4 million compared to an operating loss of $1.6 million in Q3 2023.  \nNet loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million compared to a loss of $1.5 million in Q3 2023.  \nNet loss attributable to Lendway was $1.1 million, or a loss of $0.64 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.1 million, or $0.63 per basic and diluted share in Q3 2023.  \nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.6 million compared to a loss of $1.6 million in Q3 2023.  \nAt September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 million and working capital was $11.5 million.  \nCash used in operations was $7.5 million compared to a cash generation of $2.4 million in Q3 2023.  \n  \n**First nine months fiscal year 2024**\n\nNet revenue was $31.6 million.  \n---  \nGross profit was $7.1 million, or 22.5% of sales.  \nOperating loss of $2.8 million compared to $3.0 million in Q3 2023.  \nNet loss from continuing operations was $3.5 million compared to a loss of $2.7 million in the first nine months of 2023.  \nNet loss attributable to Lendway was $2.8 million, or a loss of $1.58 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $2.7 million, or $1.53 per basic and diluted share in the first nine months of 2023.  \nAdjusted EBITDA was $3.0 million compared to a loss of $2.9 million in the first nine months of 2023.  \nCash used in operations was $2.6 million compared to $0.6 million in the first nine months of 2023.  \n  \nLendway’s Co-Chief Executive Officer, Mark Jundt commented, “We delivered strong financial results this quarter with revenue of $6.6 million. The second half of the year is our seasonally slower period and we are pleased that the business is meeting expectations.” Dan Philp, Lendway’s Co-Chief Executive Officer also commented, “Our focus in the third quarter is preparing for the upcoming busy season. Most encouragingly, through hard work by our Bloomia team, we were able to secure an _increase_ in tulips bulbs this year despite a market where bulbs were scarce due to poor growing conditions in the Netherlands. As a result of this great outcome, we believe we are well positioned for strong spring flower sales that will ultimately benefit our shareholders.”\n\n**_Q3 2024 Results_**\n\n_**Revenue**_ Revenue was $6.6 million in Q3 2024, with no revenue from continuing operations in Q3 2023. All revenue was from Bloomia, which we acquired in February 2024.\n\nRevenue for the first nine months of 2024 was $31.6 million compared to no revenue from continuing operations in the prior period. For Bloomia, the first and second calendar quarters are normally the strongest sales quarters, with the first half of the year benefiting from Valentine’s Day, Easter season and the Spring season. As anticipated, due to the seasonality of the Bloomia business, revenue was expected to decline in the second half of the year.\n\n_**Gross profit**_ Gross profit in Q3 2024 was $1.4 million, or 21.7% of sales, with no comparable measure in the prior period. We anticipated seasonality in sales, with those sales and related gross profit expected to be relatively stronger in the first and second quarters of the year.\n\nGross profit in the first nine months of 2024 was $7.1 million, or 22.5% of sales, with no comparable measure in the prior period. Excluding the non-cash inventory write-up adjustment resulting from the acquisition of Bloomia, gross profit was 27.3% of sales. We anticipated seasonality in sales, with those sales and related gross profit expected to be relatively stronger in the first and second quarters of the year.\n\n_**Operating loss**_ The Company had an operating loss of $1.4 million in Q3 2024 compared to an operating loss of $1.6 million in Q3 2023. The improvement relates to the operating profit associated with the acquisition of Bloomia, partially offset by $0.8 million in interest expense.\n\nOperating loss in the first nine months of 2024 was $2.8 million compared to $3.0 million in the prior period. The operating loss includes $2.2 million of one-time acquisition and integration costs partially offset by operating profit of Bloomia, which the Company acquired in February 2024.\n\n_**Net loss from continuing operations**_ Net loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million in Q3 2024 compared to a loss of $1.5 million in Q3 2023. The loss in the current period includes an income tax benefit and an improvement in the operating loss compared to the prior period, partially offset by the increase in interest expense related to the acquisition of Bloomia.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $3.5 million compared to a loss of $2.7 million in the prior period. The increase in the loss was primarily due to the increase in interest expense and acquisition costs related to the acquisition of Bloomia, partially offset by the income tax benefit in the period.\n\n_**Net (loss) income attributable to Lendway**_ Net loss attributable to Lendway for Q3 2024 was $1.1 million, or a loss of $0.64 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.1 million, or $0.63 per basic and diluted share, in Q3 2023. In Q3 2023, the Company benefited from a $3.0 million gain from sale of discontinued operations.\n\nNet loss attributable to Lendway for the first nine months of 2024 was $2.8 million, or a loss of $1.58 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net income of $2.7 million, or a $1.53 per basic and diluted share, in the first nine months of 2023. The net loss in 2024 includes $2.2 million of one-time acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by the operating profit from the Bloomia acquisition. In the first nine months of 2023, the Company benefitted from a $3.0 million gain from sale of discontinued operations and $2.4 million of income from its discontinued business, which it sold in August 2023.\n\nAs discussed above, we anticipated seasonality in sales, with those sales and related gross profit expected to be relatively stronger in the first and second quarters of the year. This results in expected losses in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, and a loss for the full year because of one-time acquisition costs and non-cash amortization expense.\n\n_**Adjusted EBITDA**_ In Q3 2024, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.6 million, compared to a loss of $1.6 million in Q3 2023. The improvement is a result of the operating profit associated with the acquisition of Bloomia.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes one-time acquisition and integration costs as well as other one-time charges, was $3.0 million, compared to a loss of $2.9 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n\n_**Bloomia Adjusted EBITDA**_ Bloomia has earned $5.0 million of adjusted EBITDA since acquisition. As discussed above, the seasonal Bloomia business had its strongest sales and earnings in the first two quarters of the year.\n\n_**Balance Sheet**_ As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.3 million, compared to $16.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease is attributed to Lendway funding the purchase of Bloomia with $9.2 million of cash on hand. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $11.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $15.5 million at December 31, 2023. Debt, primarily related to the acquisition, was $39.0 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**_About Lendway, Inc._** Lendway, Inc (NASDAQ:LDWY) is a specialty ag company focused on making, and managing, its ag investments in the U.S. and internationally.

Non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), have been provided as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures are not substitutes for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, respective GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly named measures used by other companies.\n\nIncluded below are reconciliations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We have included these non-GAAP performance measures as a comparable measure to eliminate the effects of non-recurring transactions that occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance as this measure excludes amounts from net loss from discontinued operations that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. Items excluded from adjusted EBITDA consist of acquisition-related costs and other costs, such as the cost of inventory that was stepped up to fair value as a result of the purchase accounting related to our acquisition of a majority interest in Bloomia. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, the cash requirements for the replacement of depreciated and amortized assets, or changes in cash requirements for our working capital needs.\n\nThe following table reconciles net loss from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThe following table reconciles Bloomia adjusted EBITDA to total Company adjusted EBITDA. Management excludes Lendway corporate overhead when evaluating its investment in Bloomia.\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet loss from continuing operations |  $ |  (1,458,000 |  ) |  $ |  (1,511,000 |  ) |  $ |  (3,541,000 |  ) |  $ |  (2,654,000 |  )  \nInterest expense (income), net |  800,000 |  (111,000 |  ) |  1,989,000 |  (325,000 |  )  \nProvision for income taxes |  (736,000 |  ) |  (11,000 |  ) |  (1,284,000 |  ) |  (4,000 |  )  \nDepreciation and amortization |  820,000 |  10,000 |  1,928,000 |  36,000  \nEBITDA |  (574,000 |  ) |  (1,623,000 |  ) |  (908,000 |  ) |  (2,947,000 |  )  \nAcquisition and integration related costs |  – |  – |  2,194,000 |  –  \nStep-up inventory written off |  – |  – |  1,522,000 |  –  \nOne-time waste costs |  – |  – |  270,000 |  –  \nNon-operating income |  – |  – |  (36,000 |  ) |  –  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ |  (574,000 |  ) |  $ |  (1,623,000 |  ) |  $ |  3,042,000 |  $ |  (2,947,000 |  )  \n**Acquisition to** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2024**  \n**Bloomia** |  **Lendway Overhead** |  **Total**  \nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes |  $ |  (3,014,000 |  ) |  $ |  (1,811,000 |  ) |  $ |  (4,825,000 |  )  \nDepreciation and amortization |  1,928,000 |  – |  1,928,000  \nInterest expense (income) |  2,142,000 |  (153,000 |  ) |  1,989,000  \nEBITDA |  1,056,000 |  (1,964,000 |  ) |  (908,000 |  )  \nAcquisition and integration related costs |  2,194,000 |  – |  2,194,000  \nNon-cash step-up inventory write-off |  1,522,000 |  – |  1,522,000  \nOne-time waste costs |  270,000 |  – |  270,000  \nNon-operating income |  (36,000 |  ) |  – |  (36,000 |  )  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ |  5,006,000 |  $ |  (1,964,000 |  ) |  $ |  3,042,000  \n  \nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures will be useful to permit investors to compare results with prior periods that did not include the one-time events and the resulting accounting charges. Management has used EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance and trends as well as our performance relative to competitors and peers; (b) to measure operational profitability on a consistent basis; (c) in presentations to the members of our Board of Directors; and (d) to evaluate compliance with covenants and restricted activities under the terms of our Credit Agreement.\n\n**Contact:**\n\nLendway, Inc.Biz McShane, CFO(763) 392-6200\n\nManage consent\n"

(NASDAQ:LDWY)**(“Lendway” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (“Q3”).\n\n**_Overview_**\n\n**Third quarter fiscal year 2024**\n\nNet revenue was $6.6 million.  \n---  \nGross profit was $1.4 million, or 21.7% of sales.  \nOperating loss of $1.4 million compared to an operating loss of $1.6 million in Q3 2023.  \nNet loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million compared to a loss of $1.5 million in Q3 2023.  \nNet loss attributable to Lendway was $1.1 million, or a loss of $0.64 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.1 million, or $0.63 per basic and diluted share in Q3 2023.  \nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.6 million compared to a loss of $1.6 million in Q3 2023.  \nAt September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 million and working capital was $11.5 million.  \nCash used in operations was $7.5 million compared to a cash generation of $2.4 million in Q3 2023.  \n  \n**First nine months fiscal year 2024**\n\nNet revenue was $31.6 million.  \n---  \nGross profit was $7.1 million, or 22.5% of sales.  \nOperating loss of $2.8 million compared to $3.0 million in Q3 2023.  \nNet loss from continuing operations was $3.5 million compared to a loss of $2.7 million in the first nine months of 2023.  \nNet loss attributable to Lendway was $2.8 million, or a loss of $1.58 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $2.7 million, or $1.53 per basic and diluted share in the first nine months of 2023.  \nAdjusted EBITDA was $3.0 million compared to a loss of $2.9 million in the first nine months of 2023.  \nCash used in operations was $2.6 million compared to $0.6 million in the first nine months of 2023.  \n  \nLendway’s Co-Chief Executive Officer, Mark Jundt commented, “We delivered strong financial results this quarter with revenue of $6.6 million. The second half of the year is our seasonally slower period and we are pleased that the business is meeting expectations.” Dan Philp, Lendway’s Co-Chief Executive Officer also commented, “Our focus in the third quarter is preparing for the upcoming busy season. Most encouragingly, through hard work by our Bloomia team, we were able to secure an _increase_ in tulips bulbs this year despite a market where bulbs were scarce due to poor growing conditions in the Netherlands. As a result of this great outcome, we believe we are well positioned for strong spring flower sales that will ultimately benefit our shareholders.”\n\n**_Q3 2024 Results_**\n\n_**Revenue**_ Revenue was $6.6 million in Q3 2024, with no revenue from continuing operations in Q3 2023. All revenue was from Bloomia, which we acquired in February 2024.\n\nRevenue for the first nine months of 2024 was $31.6 million compared to no revenue from continuing operations in the prior period. For Bloomia, the first and second calendar quarters are normally the strongest sales quarters, with the first half of the year benefiting from Valentine’s Day, Easter season and the Spring season. As anticipated, due to the seasonality of the Bloomia business, revenue was expected to decline in the second half of the year.\n\n_**Gross profit**_ Gross profit in Q3 2024 was $1.4 million, or 21.7% of sales, with no comparable measure in the prior period. We anticipated seasonality in sales, with those sales and related gross profit expected to be relatively stronger in the first and second quarters of the year.\n\nGross profit in the first nine months of 2024 was $7.1 million, or 22.5% of sales, with no comparable measure in the prior period. Excluding the non-cash inventory write-up adjustment resulting from the acquisition of Bloomia, gross profit was 27.3% of sales. We anticipated seasonality in sales, with those sales and related gross profit expected to be relatively stronger in the first and second quarters of the year.\n\n_**Operating loss**_ The Company had an operating loss of $1.4 million in Q3 2024 compared to an operating loss of $1.6 million in Q3 2023. The improvement relates to the operating profit associated with the acquisition of Bloomia, partially offset by $0.8 million in interest expense.\n\nOperating loss in the first nine months of 2024 was $2.8 million compared to $3.0 million in the prior period. The operating loss includes $2.2 million of one-time acquisition and integration costs partially offset by operating profit of Bloomia, which the Company acquired in February 2024.\n\n_**Net loss from continuing operations**_ Net loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million in Q3 2024 compared to a loss of $1.5 million in Q3 2023. The loss in the current period includes an income tax benefit and an improvement in the operating loss compared to the prior period, partially offset by the increase in interest expense related to the acquisition of Bloomia.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $3.5 million compared to a loss of $2.7 million in the prior period. The increase in the loss was primarily due to the increase in interest expense and acquisition costs related to the acquisition of Bloomia, partially offset by the income tax benefit in the period.\n\n_**Net (loss) income attributable to Lendway**_ Net loss attributable to Lendway for Q3 2024 was $1.1 million, or a loss of $0.64 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.1 million, or $0.63 per basic and diluted share, in Q3 2023. In Q3 2023, the Company benefited from a $3.0 million gain from sale of discontinued operations.\n\nNet loss attributable to Lendway for the first nine months of 2024 was $2.8 million, or a loss of $1.58 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net income of $2.7 million, or a $1.53 per basic and diluted share, in the first nine months of 2023. The net loss in 2024 includes $2.2 million of one-time acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by the operating profit from the Bloomia acquisition. In the first nine months of 2023, the Company benefitted from a $3.0 million gain from sale of discontinued operations and $2.4 million of income from its discontinued business, which it sold in August 2023.\n\nAs discussed above, we anticipated seasonality in sales, with those sales and related gross profit expected to be relatively stronger in the first and second quarters of the year. This results in expected losses in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, and a loss for the full year because of one-time acquisition costs and non-cash amortization expense.\n\n_**Adjusted EBITDA**_ In Q3 2024, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.6 million, compared to a loss of $1.6 million in Q3 2023. The improvement is a result of the operating profit associated with the acquisition of Bloomia.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes one-time acquisition and integration costs as well as other one-time charges, was $3.0 million, compared to a loss of $2.9 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n\n_**Bloomia Adjusted EBITDA**_ Bloomia has earned $5.0 million of adjusted EBITDA since acquisition. As discussed above, the seasonal Bloomia business had its strongest sales and earnings in the first two quarters of the year.\n\n_**Balance Sheet**_ As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.3 million, compared to $16.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease is attributed to Lendway funding the purchase of Bloomia with $9.2 million of cash on hand. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $11.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $15.5 million at December 31, 2023. Debt, primarily related to the acquisition, was $39.0 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**_About Lendway, Inc._** Lendway, Inc (NASDAQ:LDWY) is a specialty ag company focused on making, and managing, its ag investments in the U.S. and internationally.

Non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), have been provided as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures are not substitutes for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, respective GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly named measures used by other companies.\n\nIncluded below are reconciliations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We have included these non-GAAP performance measures as a comparable measure to eliminate the effects of non-recurring transactions that occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance as this measure excludes amounts from net loss from discontinued operations that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. Items excluded from adjusted EBITDA consist of acquisition-related costs and other costs, such as the cost of inventory that was stepped up to fair value as a result of the purchase accounting related to our acquisition of a majority interest in Bloomia. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, the cash requirements for the replacement of depreciated and amortized assets, or changes in cash requirements for our working capital needs.\n\nThe following table reconciles net loss from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThe following table reconciles Bloomia adjusted EBITDA to total Company adjusted EBITDA. Management excludes Lendway corporate overhead when evaluating its investment in Bloomia.\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet loss from continuing operations |  $ |  (1,458,000 |  ) |  $ |  (1,511,000 |  ) |  $ |  (3,541,000 |  ) |  $ |  (2,654,000 |  )  \nInterest expense (income), net |  800,000 |  (111,000 |  ) |  1,989,000 |  (325,000 |  )  \nProvision for income taxes |  (736,000 |  ) |  (11,000 |  ) |  (1,284,000 |  ) |  (4,000 |  )  \nDepreciation and amortization |  820,000 |  10,000 |  1,928,000 |  36,000  \nEBITDA |  (574,000 |  ) |  (1,623,000 |  ) |  (908,000 |  ) |  (2,947,000 |  )  \nAcquisition and integration related costs |  – |  – |  2,194,000 |  –  \nStep-up inventory written off |  – |  – |  1,522,000 |  –  \nOne-time waste costs |  – |  – |  270,000 |  –  \nNon-operating income |  – |  – |  (36,000 |  ) |  –  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ |  (574,000 |  ) |  $ |  (1,623,000 |  ) |  $ |  3,042,000 |  $ |  (2,947,000 |  )  \n**Acquisition to** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2024**  \n**Bloomia** |  **Lendway Overhead** |  **Total**  \nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes |  $ |  (3,014,000 |  ) |  $ |  (1,811,000 |  ) |  $ |  (4,825,000 |  )  \nDepreciation and amortization |  1,928,000 |  – |  1,928,000  \nInterest expense (income) |  2,142,000 |  (153,000 |  ) |  1,989,000  \nEBITDA |  1,056,000 |  (1,964,000 |  ) |  (908,000 |  )  \nAcquisition and integration related costs |  2,194,000 |  – |  2,194,000  \nNon-cash step-up inventory write-off |  1,522,000 |  – |  1,522,000  \nOne-time waste costs |  270,000 |  – |  270,000  \nNon-operating income |  (36,000 |  ) |  – |  (36,000 |  )  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ |  5,006,000 |  $ |  (1,964,000 |  ) |  $ |  3,042,000  \n  \nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures will be useful to permit investors to compare results with prior periods that did not include the one-time events and the resulting accounting charges.

ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nby [Investor Relations](https://lendway.com/author/investors/ \"Posts by Investor Relations\") | May 20, 2024 | [Press Release](https://lendway.com/category/press-release/) | [0 comments](https://lendway.com/2024/05/20/lendway-inc-announces-first-quarter-2024-financial-results/#respond)\n\n**MINNEAPOLIS, MN – May 20, 2024 – Lendway, Inc.****(Nasdaq:LDWY)**(“Lendway” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the first quarter (“Q1”) ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**_Strategic Business Operations Update_**\n\nThe Company has strategically evolved into a specialty agricultural and finance company with an operational focus on its agricultural investments. These developments include:\n\n  * April 2023: The Company launched its lending business (the “Lending Business”) through the hiring of Randy Uglem. The Company is seeking to build a scalable non-bank lending business to purchase existing loans or originate and fund new loans, all of which will be secured by collateral.\n  * August 2023: The Company completed the sale of certain assets and certain liabilities relating to the Company’s legacy business of providing in-store advertising solutions to brands, retailers, shopper marketing agencies and brokerages (the “In-Store Marketing Business”). The operations of the In-Store Marketing Business are presented as discontinued operations.\n  * February 2024: The Company became a majority owner of Bloomia B.V. and its affiliated entities (“Bloomia”).\n\n\n\nLendway acquired its interest in Bloomia ([www.bloomia.com](www.bloomia.com)), for a purchase price of $53.4 million, comprised of $34.9 million in cash, $15.5 million of seller bridge loans and $3.0 million of equity in the acquired business. Bloomia’s primary business is purchasing tulip bulbs, hydroponically growing tulips from the bulbs, and selling the tulip stems to retail stores.\n\nLendway’s Q1 results include Bloomia’s results from the acquisition date, February 22, 2024, through March 31, 2024. Bloomia’s sales have historically experienced substantial seasonality, with the first and second calendar quarters being the strongest sales quarters and the first quarter benefiting from Valentine’s Day, Easter season and the start of the Spring season. Q1 was also significantly impacted by $1,542,000 of acquisition-related costs, and $1,360,000 of amortization expense in costs of goods sold from the fair value step-up in inventory, resulting from acquisition method accounting.\n\n**_Overview_**\n\n  * Q1 2024 net sales were $8.0 million.\n  * Q1 2024 operating loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million compared to $628,000 in Q1 2023.\n  * Q1 2024 net loss from continuing operations was $1.3 million, or $0.77 per basic share and diluted share, compared to $528,000 of net loss from continuing operations, or $0.29 per basic and diluted share in Q1 2023.\n  * Q1 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $1.7M compared to ($614,000) in Q1 2023.\n\n\n\nLendway CEO Randy Uglem, said: “the first quarter of 2024 included the addition of Bloomia to the Lendway family, which marked a pivotal moment in our evolution into a dynamic specialty ag and finance enterprise. I’m pleased with Bloomia’s performance thus far and appreciate the efforts of the new team to integrate.”\n\n**_Q1 2024 Results_**\n\nRevenue from continuing operations was $8,033,000 in Q1 2024, with no such revenue in Q1 2023. All revenue was from Bloomia as the decision to allocate capital to the Bloomia acquisition constrained capital and management resources available for the non-bank lending business. For Bloomia, the first and second calendar quarters are normally the strongest sales quarters, with the first calendar quarter benefiting from Valentine’s Day, Easter season and the start of the Spring season.\n\nGross profit in Q1 2024 was $1,894,000, or 23.6% of revenue, up from zero in Q1 2023. Gross profit in Q1 2023 was impacted by $1,360,000 of amortization expense in costs of goods sold from the fair value step-up in inventory, resulting from acquisition method accounting. The step-up was fully amortized at March 31, 2024.\n\nSales, general and administrative expenses in Q1 2024 were $3,388,000, or 42.2% of revenue, compared to $628,000 in Q1 2023. Increased selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to $1,542,000 of one-time acquisition-related expenses and expanded operations from the Bloomia acquisition.\n\nInterest expense for Q1 2024 was $225,000, compared to interest income of $103,000 for Q1 2023. The interest expense resulted from financing the Bloomia acquisition.\n\nIncome tax benefit for Q1 2024 was 20.6% of pretax loss from continuing operations, or a benefit of $347,000, compared to income tax expense of 0.6% of pretax loss from continuing operations, or $3,000, in Q1 2023.\n\nAs a result of the items above, the net loss for Q1 2024 was $1,264,000, or $0.73 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1,648,000, or $0.92 per basic and diluted share, in Q1 2023. As discussed above, we anticipate seasonality in sales, with those sales and related gross profit expected to be relatively stronger in the first and second quarters of the year, resulting in expected losses in the remaining quarters of 2024 and a loss for the full year because of one-time acquisition costs and amortization expense.\n\nQ1 2024 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $1.7M, compared to ($614,000) in Q1 2023.\n\nThe CEO of Bloomia owns 18.6% of Bloomia and his minority interest share of the Bloomia comprehensive loss was $223,000 for Q1 2024.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $5.0 million, compared to $16.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease being attributed to Lendway funding the purchase of Bloomia with $9.2 million of cash. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $11.1 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $15.5 million at December 31, 2023.\n\n**_About Lendway, Inc._**\n\nLendway, Inc (Nasdaq:LDWY) is a specialty ag and finance company focused on making and managing its ag investments in the U.S. and internationally.

Non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), have been provided as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures are not substitutes for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, respective GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly named measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following table reconciles net loss from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/2c5d6735-2315-41be-b760-04dbb5658933/865510/image.png)\n\nIncluded above are reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We have included these non-GAAP performance measures as a comparable measure to eliminate the effects of non-recurring transactions that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance as this measure excludes amounts from net loss from continuing operations that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA consist of acquisition-related costs and other costs such as the cost of inventory that was stepped up to fair value as a result of the purchase accounting related to our acquisition of a majority interest in Bloomia. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, the cash requirements for the replacement of depreciated and amortized assets, or changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures will be useful to permit investors to compare results with prior periods that did not include the one-time events and the resulting accounting charges. Management has used EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance and trends as well as our performance relative to competitors and peers; (b) to measure operational profitability on a consistent basis; (c) in presentations to the members of our Board of Directors; and (d) to evaluate compliance with covenants and restricted activities under the terms of our Credit Agreement and outstanding notes, as further described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of the 10-K.\n\n**Contact:**\n\nLendway, Inc.Randy Uglem, CEO(763) 392-6200\n\n**SOURCE:** Lendway, Inc.\n\nManage consent\n"
