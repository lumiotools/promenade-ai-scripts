We believe these results are among the strongest ever reported for an antiviral in an RSV challenge study, and significantly unlock further promise of our RSV program, in addition to advancing our leadership role in the RSV treatment landscape,” said Jay R. Luly, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer at Enanta Pharmaceuticals. “With results from our RSVPEDs study of zelicapavir, our RSV N-inhibitor, expected in December, we could potentially have two of the leading clinical candidates for the treatment of RSV with different mechanisms of action, providing us with important optionality. The results of these studies will guide our decisions as we work to develop first-in-disease and best-in-class treatments for patients suffering from RSV.” \n\nDr. Luly added, “We also made notable progress in advancing and expanding our immunology portfolio with the nomination of EPS-1421 as our lead development candidate for our KIT inhibition program. We are excited about the potential for potent and selective, oral, small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria and possibly other mast cell driven diseases. We are also pleased to introduce our second discovery stage program to develop oral STAT6 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 immune driven diseases, with an initial focus on the treatment of atopic dermatitis, and future expansion opportunities in asthma and other indications. With multiple ongoing programs in both virology and immunology, we are committed to advancing our pipeline to help patients and to create value for shareholders.” \n\n**Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Year-Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue was $14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of royalty revenue derived from worldwide net sales of AbbVie’s hepatitis C virus (HCV) regimen MAVYRET®/MAVIRET®, compared to royalty revenue of $18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue was $67.6 million compared to $79.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in the quarter and in year-over-year revenue is due to a decline in AbbVie’s sales of MAVYRET®/MAVIRET®. \n\nA portion (54.5%) of Enanta’s ongoing royalty revenue from AbbVie’s net sales of MAVYRET®/MAVIRET® is paid to OMERS, one of Canada’s largest defined benefit pension plans, pursuant to a royalty sale transaction affecting royalties earned after June 2023. For financial reporting purposes, the transaction was treated as debt, with the upfront purchase payment of $200.0 million recorded as a liability. Each quarter, Enanta records 100% of the royalty earned as revenue and then amortizes the debt liability proportionally as 54.5% of the cash royalty payments are paid to OMERS through June 30, 2032, subject to a cap of 1.42 times the purchase payment, after which point 100% of the cash royalty payments will be retained by Enanta. Interest expense was $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $10.9 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to interest expense of $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and $5.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nResearch and development expenses were $30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $36.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were $131.5 million compared to $163.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in the quarter and in year-over-year research and development expenses is primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with Enanta’s COVID-19 program as the company announced previously that plans to pursue any further COVID-19 efforts would be in the context of collaborations. These decreases were partially offset by increased costs associated with Enanta’s immunology programs. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were $57.9 million compared to $52.9 million in 2023. The increase in year-over-year general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in legal fees related to the company’s patent infringement suit against Pfizer. \n\nInterest and investment income, net, totaled $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to lower cash and investment balances year-over-year. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, interest and investment income, net, totaled $14.8 million compared to $11.4 million in 2023. The increase was due to an increase in average invested cash due to receipt of $200.0 million from OMERS in April 2023 as well as changes in interest rates year-over-year. \n\nEnanta recorded an income tax benefit of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Enanta recorded an income tax benefit of $1.7 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax expense of $2.8 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax benefit during 2024 was due to interest earned on a pending $28.7 million federal income tax refund. Despite recording a loss before taxes during the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, Enanta recorded tax expense driven by the receipt of the $200.0 million from OMERS, which is treated as income for Federal and State income tax purposes. \n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $28.8 million, or a loss of $1.36 per diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $28.1 million, or a loss of $1.33 per diluted common share, for the corresponding period in 2023. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was $116.0 million, or a loss of $5.48 per diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $133.8 million, or loss of $6.38 per diluted common share for the corresponding period in 2023. \n\nEnanta’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $248.2 million at September 30, 2024. Enanta expects that its current cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, as well as its continuing retained portion of royalty revenue, will continue to be sufficient to meet the anticipated cash requirements of its existing business and development programs into fiscal 2027. \n\n**Virology**\n\nRSV\n\n  * Enanta is progressing multiple clinical programs comprising a robust antiviral portfolio aimed at treating populations at high-risk for serious outcomes from RSV infection. This includes zelicapavir, Enanta’s lead, oral N-protein inhibitor, and EDP-323, its oral L-protein inhibitor, both of which received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n    * Zelicapavir is being evaluated in two Phase 2 clinical trials in high-risk pediatric and adult populations. \n      * Enrollment is complete in RSVPEDs, a first-in-pediatrics Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of zelicapavir in hospitalized and non-hospitalized RSV patients that are 28 days to three years of age. The company is on track to report topline data in December 2024. \n      * RSVHR is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of zelicapavir in adults with RSV infection who are at high risk of complications, including age over 65 years and/or those with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. Enrollment in RSVHR is progressing, and the company is targeting enrollment completion in the current Northern Hemisphere RSV season. \n    * Enanta’s second clinical RSV candidate, EDP-323, is a novel oral, direct-acting antiviral selectively targeting the RSV L-protein. \n      * In September 2024, Enanta announced positive topline results for EDP-323 in a Phase 2a challenge study of healthy adults infected with RSV. Treatment with EDP-323 achieved statistically significant (p=<0.0001) reductions in both viral load and clinical symptoms compared to placebo. Overall, EDP-323 was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile that was comparable to placebo over 5 days of dosing through Day 28 of follow-up. There were no serious adverse events and no discontinuations of EDP-323. With these positive results the company has a potential second approach for treating RSV that may offer a best-in-disease opportunity. Pending RSVPEDs data results, Enanta will provide next steps for EDP-323 and its RSV program. \n\n\n\n**Immunology**\n\n  * Today, Enanta announced the expansion of its immunology portfolio which is focused on designing and developing highly potent and selective, oral small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, by targeting key drivers of the type 2 immune response. \n    * KIT Inhibitor EPS-1421: \n      * Enanta nominated EPS-1421 as its lead development candidate. EPS-1421 is a novel, potent and selective oral inhibitor of KIT, designed to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria and potentially other indications by depleting mast cells, thereby addressing a primary driver of these diseases. \n      * EPS-1421 inhibits KIT with nanomolar potency in both binding and cellular assays and is highly selective for KIT versus other kinases. Further, EPS-1421 has demonstrated good _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ ADME properties preclinically. The company expects to conduct scale-up activities and IND enabling studies in 2025. \n    * STAT6 Inhibitors: \n      * The company’s second discovery program is aimed at developing oral STAT6 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 immune driven diseases and will initially focus on atopic dermatitis and potentially other indications by blocking the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathway, thereby addressing a primary driver of these diseases. \n      * Currently, Enanta is advancing novel, potent and selective oral inhibitors of STAT6. The company’s prototype inhibitors demonstrate potent activity and high selectivity for STAT6 over other STATs in both biochemical and cellular assays. Enanta continues to evaluate multiple compounds in preclinical studies and expects to conduct lead optimization activities for this program in 2025. \n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n  * Enanta will not be holding a conference call with today’s fiscal fourth quarter and year-end update. The company will provide its next update with the release of the RSVPEDs study results, expected in December 2024. \n\n\n\n**About Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nEnanta is using its robust, chemistry-driven approach and drug discovery capabilities to become a leader in the discovery and development of small molecule drugs with an emphasis on indications in virology and immunology. Enanta’s clinical programs are currently focused on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and its earlier-stage immunology pipeline aims to develop treatments for inflammatory diseases by targeting key drivers of the type 2 immune response, including KIT and STAT6 inhibition. \n\nGlecaprevir, a protease inhibitor discovered by Enanta, is part of one of the leading treatment regimens for curing chronic hepatitis c virus (HCV) infection and is sold by AbbVie in numerous countries under the tradenames MAVYRET® (U.S.) and MAVIRET® (ex-U.S.) (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir). A portion of Enanta’s royalties from HCV products developed under its collaboration with AbbVie contribute ongoing funding to Enanta’s operations.

These data demonstrated that EDP-323 was generally safe and well-tolerated and achieved an 85-87% reduction in viral load area under the curve (AUC) by qRT-PCR (p<0.0001), a 97-98% reduction in infectious viral load AUC by viral culture (p<0.0001), and a 66-78% reduction of total clinical symptoms score AUC (p<0.0001) compared to placebo. EDP-323, which received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is a novel L-protein inhibitor in development as a once-daily oral treatment for RSV. \n\n“We are excited about these impressive data that demonstrate a rapid and sustained reduction in viral load. These results are among the strongest ever reported in an RSV challenge study, raising the high bar set by zelicapavir. The significant antiviral activity and symptom alleviation observed in this study highlight EDP-323’s potential as a safe, highly effective, direct-acting antiviral for the treatment of RSV,” said Scott T. Rottinghaus, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Enanta Pharmaceuticals. \n\n“These EDP-323 results represent a meaningful advancement toward achieving our longstanding goal of developing new medicines to treat respiratory infections such as RSV, as there remains a substantial need for safe and effective oral treatments. Enanta has the leading portfolio of potent RSV replication inhibitors, with EDP-323, our L-protein inhibitor, and zelicapavir, our N-protein inhibitor, both in Phase 2 development. These distinct mechanisms have the potential to be developed as once-daily single agents or in combination for specific patient populations,” added Jay R. Luly, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Enanta Pharmaceuticals. \n\n**EDP-323 Phase 2a Challenge Study Topline Results**\n\nThis Phase 2a study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human challenge study of 142 healthy adult participants inoculated with RSV. Randomized participants (n=141) received either a once-daily (QD) 600 mg dose of EDP-323 for five days [high dose, n=47], a single 600 mg loading dose on day one followed by a 200 mg once-daily (QD) dose of EDP-323 for four days [low dose, n=47], or placebo for five days [n=47]. The intent-to-treat-infected population (ITT-I) was defined as all randomized participants receiving challenge virus and at least one dose of study drug with confirmed RSV infection. \n\nEDP-323 demonstrated a rapid and sustained antiviral effect. A highly statistically significant reduction (p<0.0001) was observed for the primary efficacy endpoint of AUC for viral load as measured by qRT-PCR in the ITT-I population for each of the EDP-323 dosing groups as compared with placebo. Specifically, EDP-323 lowered viral load AUC by 85% in the high dose arm and 87% in the low dose arm compared to placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between the two EDP-323 dosing groups. \n\nA highly statistically significant reduction (p<0.0001) was observed for the secondary efficacy endpoint of AUC for infectious viral load as measured by quantitative culture in the ITT-I population for each of the EDP-323 dosing groups, with a reduction in viral culture AUC by 98% in the high dose arm and 97% in the low dose arm compared to placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between the two EDP-323 dosing groups. \n\nFor the secondary efficacy endpoint of AUC for total symptom score, a highly statistically significant reduction (p<0.0001) was observed in the ITT-I population for each of the EDP-323 dosing groups, with a symptom reduction of 66% in the high dose arm and 78% in the low dose arm compared to placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between the two EDP-323 dosing groups. \n\nEDP-323 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics, supportive of once-daily dosing. Mean trough plasma concentrations were maintained at 16-fold above the protein-adjusted EC90 with the low dose, and 35-fold above the protein-adjusted EC90 with the high dose, for both RSV A and B strains. \n\nOverall, EDP-323 demonstrated a favorable safety profile over a 5-day dosing period and through 28 days of follow-up. Adverse events were similar between EDP-323 dosing groups and placebo. There were no serious adverse events, no severe adverse events, and no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation or study withdrawal. \n\nFull data from the study will be presented at a future medical conference or in a peer-reviewed publication. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information** Enanta will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. ET.

In a Phase 1 study, EDP-323 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated in healthy subjects up to 800 mg for up to seven days, with a pharmacokinetic profile supporting once-daily dosing and all doses achieving target exposures. In addition to its Phase 1 profile, EDP-323 is also supported by _in vitro_ data demonstrating a significant reduction in RSV replication with picomolar potency in primary human bronchial epithelial cells infected with RSV A and B, and across a range of RSV clinical isolates and various cell types. In a mouse model of RSV infection, EDP-323 treatment was associated with dose-dependent decreases in viral load in the lung, reductions in lung immunopathology and decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ, TNFα, and IL1β. \n\n**About Respiratory Syncytial Virus** RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia in children under one year of age in the United States and a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults and immunocompromised individuals.1 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, virtually all children in the United States get an RSV infection by the time they are two years old and one to two out of every 100 children younger than six months of age with an RSV infection may need to be hospitalized.2 Globally, there are an estimated 33 million cases of RSV annually in children less than five years of age, with about 3 million hospitalized and up to approximately 120,000 dying each year from complications associated with the infection.3 RSV represents a significant health threat for adults older than 65 years of age, with an estimated 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths associated with RSV infections annually in the United States.4\n\n**About Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. **Enanta is using its robust, chemistry-driven approach and drug discovery capabilities to become a leader in the discovery and development of small molecule drugs with an emphasis on indications in virology and immunology.
