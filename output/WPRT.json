(“**Westport** \") (TSX:WPRT / Nasdaq:WPRT), a leading supplier of advanced alternative fuel systems and components for the global transportation industry, reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided an update on operations. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\n“Westport delivered solid results in the third quarter of 2024. Although revenue was down, this decrease was more than outweighed by the revenue earned at Cespira and we delivered significant improvement in Adjusted EBITDA. We continue to execute against our three strategic pillars - harnessing the potential of our HPDI joint venture, enhancing operational excellence, and driving continuous innovation to shape the world’s alternative fueled future. The third quarter represented the first full quarter with Cespira, our HPDI joint venture with Volvo Group, being operational. This, along with the steps we have taken with respect to various cost cutting measures, has enabled Westport to decrease our costs including research and development as well as sales, general and administrative expenses by approximately 40 percent as compared to the same period last year.\n\nWe remain confident in the role that alternative fuels will play in driving sustainability in the future of the transportation and industrial application space. Regarding hydrogen, we acknowledge the slowdown in infrastructure development in the global market, which has tapered the adoption of automotive and industrial applications powered by hydrogen. The success of this market depends on the installation of infrastructure and the production of clean hydrogen, both of which have been slow to materialize. However, we are steadfast in our belief that hydrogen as a fuel will prevail – although gradual as opposed to immediate – and become a clean fuel source that is adopted worldwide. In the meantime, Westport currently delivers a suite of proven and innovative components and systems for a wide range of affordable alternative low-carbon fuels such as natural gas, renewable natural gas, propane, and hydrogen. We are driving cleaner performance by addressing lower emissions regulations with practical applications using innovation available today.\n\nAs we navigate the next quarter, and the next year, Westport is strongly committed to driving operational excellence, nurturing innovation, and supporting Cespira, all to position the Company for sustainable growth in an evolving landscape. We are focused and dedicated to the present and our future.\"\n\nDan Sceli, Chief Executive Officer, Westport Fuel Systems\n\n**Q3 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Revenues decreased by 14% to $66.2 million compared to $77.4 million in the same quarter last year, primarily driven by the transition of the Heavy-Duty OEM revenues now being reflected in the results of Cespira, of which Westport accounts for as an equity investment.\n  * Net loss of $3.9 million for the quarter, an improvement over the net loss of $11.9 million for the same quarter last year. This was primarily the result of an improvement in gross margin by $1.3 million compared to the prior year quarter, a significant decrease in operating expenditures and depreciation and amortization as costs previously associated with our HPDI business are now accrued by Cespira, cost reductions in Westport and a net foreign exchange gain of $1.1 million.\n  * Continued improvement in Adjusted EBITDA[2] achieving negative $0.8 million compared to negative $3.0 million for the same period in 2023.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $33.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Cash used in operating activities was $9.9 million primarily from an increase in working capital of $11.4 million. Cash provided by investing activities included the sale of investments for $9.6 million related to the collection of $8.4 million from the formation of the HPDI JV and sale of our ownership interest in Westport Weichai Inc. (\"Weichai\"), partially offset by the purchase of capital assets of $2.1 million. Cash used in financing activities represented debt repayments of $7.0 million in the quarter.\n  * In September 2024, HPDI Technology, the joint venture between Volvo Group and Westport, launched as Cespira.\n\n**CONSOLIDATED RESULTS**  \n---  \n($ in millions, except per share amounts)| **3Q24**| **3Q23**| **Over /****(Under)****%**| **9M24**| **9M23**| **Over /****(Under)****%**  \nRevenues| $| 66.2| $| 77.4| (14| )%| $| 227.2| $| 244.7| (7| )%  \nGross Margin(2)| 14.5| 13.2| 10| %| 43.3| 40.9| 6| %  \nGross Margin %(2)| 22| %| 17| %| 19| %| 17| %  \nIncome (loss) from Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method(1)| (2.8| )| 0.4| (800| )%| (3.4| )| 0.6| (670| )%  \nNet Loss| $| (3.9| )| $| (11.9| )| 68| %| $| (11.7| )| $| (35.8| )| 67| %  \nNet Loss per Share - Basic| $| (0.22| )| $| (0.70| )| 69| %| $| (0.68| )| $| (2.08| )| 67| %  \nNet Loss per Share - Diluted| $| (0.22| )| $| (0.70| )| 69| %| $| (0.68| )| $| (2.08| )| 67| %  \nEBITDA(2)| $| (0.3| )| $| (8.6| )| 97| %| $| (0.5| )| $| (25.0| )| 98| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA(2)| $| (0.8| )| $| (3.0| )| 73| %| $| (9.4| )| $| (11.5| )| 18| %  \n  \n(1) _This includes income (loss) from Minda Westport Technologies Limited and Cespira._\n\n(2)_Gross margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Light-Duty revenue decreased by $6.2 million compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by a decrease in sales in our DOEM, and fuel storage businesses and partially offset by an increase in sales in our light-duty OEM, electronics, and IAM businesses.\n\nGross margin increased by $1.9 million to $13.9 million, or 23% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.0 million, or 20% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by a slight increase in sales volumes, a change in sales mix with increases in sales to European customers and reduction in sales to developing regions.\n\nGross margin increased by $4.3 million to $41.4 million, or 21% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $37.1 million, or 19% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by a change in sales mix with an increase in sales to European customers and a reduction in sales to developing regions.\n\nWestport began supplying its Euro 6 LPG fuel system to its global OEM customer in early 2024. Despite a slower start to production than anticipated, Westport expects to exceed planned Euro 6 LPG fuel system deliveries in 2024. This production supply agreement has been instrumental in improving revenue and delivering higher margins, which more than offset the decline in revenue as a result of a key delayed OEM customer continuing to work through their inventory. Production for the Euro 7 LPG fuel system for the same global OEM customer is anticipated to begin mid-to-late 2025.\n\nThe Light-Duty segment continues to evolve our LPG fuel system solution, providing more customers with a cost-competitive alternative fuel solution. Recently, two new product platforms were announced utilizing our systems. Westport was excited to be part of the first-ever OEM hybrid vehicle powered by HEV and LPG technologies - the Kia Niro Tri-Fuel in Italy. This revolutionary product, born from Westport's historic partnership with Kia Italia, offers three fuel sources—petrol, electric, and LPG—delivering over 1,600 km on full tanks with reduced emissions and uncompromised performance. Westport also announced the global availability of a LPG fuel system for the RAM 1500 Hurricane 3.0 DI Twin Turbo engine, enabling customers to benefit from lower emissions and lower fuel costs.\n\n**High-Pressure Controls & Systems Segment**\n\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $1.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively, compared with $3.7 million and $9.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily driven by the general slowdown in the hydrogen infrastructure development leading to a slower adoption of automotive and industrial applications powered by hydrogen.\n\nGross margin decreased by $0.6 million to $0.4 million, or 25% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.0 million or 27% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin decreased by $0.9 million to $1.5 million, or 20% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.4 million, or 26% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by lower sales volume in the quarter.\n\n**Heavy-Duty OEM Segment**\n\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes revenue from the HPDI business from January 1 to June 3, the closing date of the transaction to form Cespira plus revenue earned under a transitional services agreement. Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, compared with $13.5 million and $34.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is a result of the transition of this business to Cespira and the resulting change in accounting treatment. We continue to earn service revenue from Cespira under the transitional services agreement for the quarter, which is represented in this segment.\n\nGross margin was $0.2 million, or 6% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $0.2 million or 1% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin decreased by $1.0 million to $0.4 million, or 2% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.4 million, or 4% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Selected Cespira Statements of Operations Data**\n\nWe account for Cespira using the equity method of accounting for investments.\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the financial results of Cespira for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the period between June 3, 2024 to September 30, 2024:\n\n**Three months ended September 30,**| **Change**| **Period ended September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \n _(in millions of U.S. dollars)_| **2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**| **2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**  \nRevenue| $| 16.2| $| —| $| 16.2| —| %| $| 20.3| $| —| $| 20.3| —| %  \nGross margin1| $| (1.1| )| $| —| $| (1.1| )| —| %| $| (0.9| )| $| —| $| (0.9| )| —| %  \n_Gross margin %__1_| (7| )%| —| %| (4| )%| —| %  \nOperating loss| $| (5.3| )| $| —| $| (5.3| )| —| %| $| (7.3| )| $| —| $| (7.3| )| —| %  \nNet loss attributable to the Company| $| (3.0| )| $| —| $| (3.0| )| —| %| $| (4.1| )| $| —| $| (4.1| )| —| %  \n  \n(1) _Gross margin is a non-GAAP measure.

For the prior year quarter, the Heavy-Duty OEM segment included our HPDI business which earned $13.5 million. The revenue increase is largely driven by an increase in HPDI systems sold.\n\nCespira lost $1.1 million on gross margin for three months ended September 30, 2024. For the prior year quarter, the Heavy-Duty OEM segment earned $0.2 million.\n\nCespira had operating losses of $5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the prior year quarter, Heavy-Duty OEM had incurred operating losses of $3.7 million.\n\nAs previously announced, Westport and Weichai are parties to a technology development and supply agreement which contains an obligation for Weichai to order, and Westport to supply, certain volumes of HPDI fuel system components prior to December 31, 2024. Significant orders for HPDI fuel system components against this agreement have not been received to date and we do not currently anticipate that orders for any significant additional volumes will be received prior to year end. Westport and Cespira continue to collaborate with Weichai Power Co. Ltd (“Weichai Power”) on an HPDI fuel system equipped version of the Weichai Power engine platforms. The parties are currently discussing the next stages of this work and the obligations of each party going forward.\n\n**SEGMENT RESULTS**| **Three months ended September 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**Revenue**| **Operating income (loss)**| **Depreciation & amortization**| **Equity income (loss)**  \nLight-Duty| $| 61.5| $| 2.4| $| 1.6| $| 0.2  \nHigh-Pressure Controls & Systems| 1.6| (1.2| )| 0.1| —  \nHeavy-Duty OEM| 3.1| 0.9| —| —  \nCorporate| —| (1.0| )| 0.1| (3.0| )  \nCespira| 16.2| (5.3| )| 0.9| —  \nTotal segment| 82.4| (4.2| )| 2.7| (2.8| )  \nLess: Cespira| 16.2| (5.3| )| 0.9| —  \n**Total consolidated**| **$**| **66.2**| **$**| **1.1**| **$**| **1.8**| **$**| **(2.8**| **)**  \n**SEGMENT RESULTS**| **Three months ended September 30, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Revenue**| **Operating loss**| **Depreciation & amortization**| **Equity income**  \nLight-Duty| $| 60.2| $| (3.0| )| $| 1.7| $| 0.4  \nHigh-Pressure Controls & Systems| 3.7| (0.4| )| 0.1| —  \nHeavy-Duty OEM| 13.5| (3.7| )| 1.3| —  \nCorporate| —| (5.0| )| 0.1| —  \n**Total Consolidated**| **$**| **77.4**| **$**| **(12.1**| **)**| **$**| **3.2**| **$**| **0.4**  \n  \n**Q3 2024 Conference Call** Westport has scheduled a conference call on November 13, 2024, at 7:00 am Pacific Time (10:00 am Eastern Time) to discuss these results.

The Company defines gross margin as revenue less cost of revenue. The Company defines EBITDA as net income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted for interest expense (net), depreciation and amortization. Westport Fuel Systems defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA from continuing operations excluding expenses for stock-based compensation, unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss, and non-cash and other adjustments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a long-term indicator of operational performance since it ties closely to the business units’ ability to generate sustained cash flow and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Adjusted EBITDA includes the company's share of income from joint ventures.\n\nThe terms gross margin, gross margin as a percentage of revenue, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"**U.S. GAAP** \") and are not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing the company's operating performance, investors should not consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss or other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Among other things, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the company's actual cash expenditures. Other companies may calculate similar measures differently than Westport Fuel Systems, limiting their usefulness as comparative tools.

(TSX: WPRT / Nasdaq: WPRT) (“Westport” or “The Company”) announces that it has established an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) that allows the Company to issue and sell up to US$35,000,000 (or its Canadian dollar equivalent) of common shares of the Company (the “Common Shares”) from treasury to the public, from time to time, at the Company’s discretion. \n\nDistributions of the Common Shares under the ATM Program will be made pursuant to the terms of an equity distribution agreement dated September 13, 2024 (the “Distribution Agreement”) entered into among the Company and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (collectively the “U.S. Agents”) and Cormark Securities Inc. (the “Canadian Agent” and together with the U.S. Agents, the \"Agents\").\n\nThe ATM will allow Westport through the Agents, to, from time to time, offer and sell Common Shares, in Canada and the United States through the facilities of the TSX Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") and Nasdaq Global Select Markets (\"Nasdaq\"). The ATM Program will be effective until the earlier of: (i) the date that all of the Common Shares available for issue under the ATM Program have been sold; (ii) June 18, 2025; (iii) the date the Canadian Prospectus Supplement in respect of the ATM Program or the Canadian Base Shelf Prospectus is withdrawn; or (iv) the date that the ATM Program is terminated by the Company or the Agents.\n\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the ATM Program primarily for funding investments in its hydrogen business, research and development and for general corporate purposes.\n\nAny Common Shares sold through the ATM Program will be sold at prevailing market prices when issued: (i) in ordinary brokers' transactions on the Nasdaq, quoted or otherwise traded; or (ii) in ordinary brokers' transactions on the TSX. Since the Common Shares will be distributed at the prevailing market prices at the time of their sale or as otherwise permitted by law, prices may vary among purchasers and during the period of distribution.\n\nThe offer and sale of the Common Shares under the ATM Program will be made by means of a prospectus supplement dated September 13, 2024 (the “Canadian Prospectus Supplement”) to the Company’s existing shelf prospectus dated May 18, 2023 (the “Canadian Base Shelf Prospectus”) and pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated September 13, 2024 (the “U.S. Prospectus Supplement”) to the Company’s U.S. base prospectus dated May 18, 2023 (the “U.S. Base Prospectus”) included in its registration statement on Form F-10 (File No. 333-271271) (the “Registration Statement”) and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Canadian Prospectus Supplement and the Canadian Base Shelf Prospectus will be available on SEDAR+ at [www.sedarplus.ca](http://www.sedarplus.ca), and the U.S. Prospectus Supplement, the U.S. Base Prospectus and the Registration Statement will be available on EDGAR at <http://www.sec.gov>.\n\nThis news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Common Shares, nor shall there be any sale of the Common Shares in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\n\n**About Westport Fuel Systems** At Westport Fuel Systems, we are driving innovation to power a cleaner tomorrow.

Company organization and operations:\nWestport Fuel Systems Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) on March 20,\n1995. Westport Fuel Systems is a global company focused on engineering, manufacturing, and supplying alternative fuel\nsystems and components for transportation applications. The Company’s diverse product offerings sold under a wide range of\nestablished global brands enable the use of a number of alternative fuels in the transportation sector that provide environmental\nand/or economic advantages as compared to diesel, gasoline, batteries or fuel cell powered vehicles. The Company's fuel\nsystems and associated components control the pressure and flow of these alternative fuels, including liquid petroleum gas\n(\"LPG\"), compressed natural gas (\"CNG\"), liquified natural gas (\"LNG\"), renewable natural gas (\"RNG\") or biomethane, and\nhydrogen. The Company supplies its products in more than 70 countries through a network of distributors, service providers for\nthe aftermarket and directly to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Tier 1 and Tier 2 OEM suppliers. The\nCompany’s products and services are available for passenger car and light-, medium- and heavy-duty truck and off-road\napplications.\n2. Liquidity and going concern:\nIn connection with preparing consolidated financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, the Company is\nrequired to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Substantial\ndoubt exists when conditions and events, considered in aggregate, indicate that it is probable a company will be unable to meet\nits obligations as they become due within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. This\nevaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans and actions that have\nnot been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists, management\nevaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management’s plans, however, is only considered if both: (1) it is\nprobable the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date the financial statements are issued; and (2) it is\nprobable the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Generally,\nto be considered probable of being effectively implemented, the plans must have been approved before the date the financial\nstatements are issued.\nManagement's evaluation has concluded that there are no known or currently foreseeable conditions or events that raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these condensed\nconsolidated interim financial statements (\"interim financial statements\") are issued. These interim financial statements have\ntherefore been prepared on the basis the Company will continue as a going concern.\nThe assessment of the liquidity and going concern requires the Company to make judgments about the existence of conditions\nor events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the interim\nfinancial statements are issued. This includes judgments about the Company's future activities and the timing thereof and\nestimates of future cash flows. Significant assumptions used in the Company's forecasted model of liquidity include forecasted\nsales, forecasted costs and capital expenditures, amongst others. Changes in the assumptions could have a material impact on\nthe forecasted liquidity and going concern assessment.\nOn September 13, 2024, the Company announced an at-the-market equity offering program (the \"ATM Program\") that allows\nthe Company to issue up to $35,000 in common shares from treasury to the public from time to time, at the Company's\ndiscretion and subject to regulatory requirements. As at September 30, 2024, no shares were issued from treasury.\nAlthough the Company earned operating income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continues to\nsustain operating losses and to use cash to support its operating activities. As at September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and\ncash equivalents of $33,257 and incurred operating losses of $16,689 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The\nCompany's short-term and long-term debt was $38,743, net of deferred financing fees, of which $15,260 was current. In 2023,\nthe Company amended the minimum cash covenant under the term loan with Export Development Canada (\"EDC\") reducing\nthe minimum cash requirement to $15,000. If the Company's cash and cash equivalents fall below the minimum cash\nrequirement, the Company may be required to repay the outstanding amount of the term loan, which was $7,816 at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n6\nWESTPORT FUEL SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (unaudited)\n(Expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n2. Liquidity and going concern (continued):\nThe Company continues to experience inflationary pressure on production input costs from sourcing semiconductors, raw\nmaterials and parts, and increased labor costs that are impacting margins. The Company sources components globally and is\nexposed to price and inflation risk, which may affect the Company's liquidity.\nManagement is closely monitoring its financial condition and is working on initiatives to reduce its working capital and\nincrease profitability to improve its cash flow from operating activities. The Company's current financial projections expect\nmeaningful collections of accounts receivable from key customers and a reduction in inventory levels across the Company's\noperations.\nThe ability to continue as a going concern beyond November 2025 will depend on the Company's ability to generate sufficient\npositive cash flows from all its operations, specifically through working capital improvement, profitable and sustainable\ngrowth, and the Company's ability to finance its long-term strategic objectives and operations, including the joint venture with\nVolvo Group. If, as a result of future events, the Company was to determine it was no longer able to continue as a going\nconcern, significant adjustments would be required to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the accompanying unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and the adjustments could be material.\n3. Basis of preparation:\n(a) Basis of presentation:\nThese interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company and do not include all of the information and\ndisclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). In the opinion of management,\nall normal recurring accruals and adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the\nyear ending December 31, 2024. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the interim financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. In the statement of operations and comprehensive loss and the statement of cash flows, certain prior period figures\nhave been adjusted to conform to current period presentation.\n(b) Foreign currency translation:\nThe Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar and its reporting currency for its interim financial statement\npresentation is the United States dollar (\"U.S. Dollar\"). The functional currencies for the Company's subsidiaries include the\nfollowing: U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Argentina Peso, Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”), Swedish Krona, Indian Rupee and\nPolish Zloty. The Company translates assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations using the period\nend exchange rates, shareholders’ equity balances using the weighted average of historical exchange rates, and revenues and\nexpenses using the monthly average rate for the period with the resulting exchange differences recognized in other\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nTransactions that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Company’s or its subsidiaries'\noperations are translated at the rates in effect on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and\nliabilities are translated to the applicable functional currency at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. Non-\nmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historical exchange rate. All foreign exchange gains and losses are\nrecognized in the condensed consolidated interim statements of operations, except for the translation gains and losses arising\nfrom available-for-sale instruments, which are recorded through other comprehensive income (loss) until realized through\ndisposal or impairment.\n7\nWESTPORT FUEL SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (unaudited)\n(Expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n3.

Recently issued accounting standards:\nRecently issued accounting guidance, not yet adopted:\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07,\n\"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,\" to enhance disclosures for significant\nsegment expenses for all public entities required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280. The amendments\nare effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Retrospective adoption is required for all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company\nis currently assessing the impacts of this ASU and expects it to impact disclosures with no impact to its operations, cash flows\nor financial position.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements in Income Tax Disclosures\" to\nenhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This amendment requires public companies to\ndisclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a\nquantitative threshold. Additionally, under the amendment entities are required to disclose the amount of income taxes paid\ndisaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes, as well as disaggregated by material individual jurisdictions. Finally, the\namendment requires entities to disclose income from continuing operations before income tax expense disaggregated between\ndomestic and foreign and income tax expense from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. The new\nrules are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impacts of\nthis ASU and expects it to impact disclosures with no impact to its operations, cash flows or financial position.\n8\nWESTPORT FUEL SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (unaudited)\n(Expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n5. Formation of joint venture:\nCespira\nOn June 3, 2024, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Volvo Group (\"Volvo\") and contributed certain net\nassets of its former HPDI business to a newly formed joint venture (\"Cespira\" formerly the HPDI Joint Venture), consisting of\ntwo legal entities, HPDI Technology LP and HPDI Technology AB, in which the Company retained a 55% non-controlling\ninterest. Volvo acquired the remaining 45% interest in Cespira for cash consideration of $27,328. Cespira is jointly controlled\nby both parties. The Company's former HPDI business continues to operate through the joint venture.\nThe Company deconsolidated the HPDI business and accounted for the Company's investment in Cespira under the equity\nmethod as it is now jointly controlled. Under this accounting method, the Company's initial investment in Cespira was\nrecognized at the fair value of the Company's non-controlling interest. Subsequently, this cost basis will be adjusted for the\nCompany's share of Cespira's net income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss, net of any dividends or distributions\nreceived from Cespira.\nThis table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the proceeds received, net assets contributed at carrying value to Cespira,\nestimated tax liabilities incurred in certain jurisdictions for the net assets transferred, and gain on deconsolidation:\nJune 3, 2024\nCash proceeds $ 27,328\nOwnership interest in HPDI Technology LP 23,597\nOwnership interest in HPDI Technology AB 9,677\nTotal proceeds 60,602\nNet assets contributed to Cespira 45,435\nOther liabilities 1,901\nGain on deconsolidation $ 13,266\n6.

Commitments and contingencies:\n(a) Contractual commitments\nThe Company is a party to a variety of agreements in the ordinary course of business under which it is obligated to indemnify a\nthird party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise as a result of contracts for sale of the Company’s\nproduct to customers where the Company provides indemnification against losses arising from matters such as product\nliabilities. The potential impact on the Company’s financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable\nuncertainty exists as to whether claims will be made and the final outcome of potential claims. To date, the Company has not\nincurred significant costs related to these types of indemnifications.\n(b) Contingencies\nThe Company is engaged in certain legal actions and tax audits in the ordinary course of business and believes that, based on\nthe information currently available, the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany's operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n17\nWESTPORT FUEL SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (unaudited)\n(Expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n19.

And thank you for standing by. Welcome to Westport’s Third\nQuarter Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease be advised that today’s conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Ashley Nuell Vice President of Investor\nRelations.\nPlease go ahead.\nAshley Nuell: Good morning, everyone.\nWelcome to Westport Fuel Systems’ third quarter conference call for 2024.\nThis call is being held to coincide with the press release containing Westport’s financial\nresults that was issued yesterday.\nOn today’s call speaking on behalf of Westport is Chief Executive Officer and Director,\nDan Sceli; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Larkin.\nAttendance on this call is open to the public, but questions will be restricted to the\ninvestment community.\nYou are reminded that certain statements made on this conference call and our responses\nto certain questions may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the\nU.S. and applicable Canadian securities laws.\nAnd as such, forward-looking statements are made based on our current expectations and\ninvolve certain risks and uncertainties.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to you, Dan.\nDan Sceli: All right, thanks. Thanks, Ashley. Good morning, everyone. Today I will be\nsummarizing Westport's progress and results for the third quarter of 2024, providing\nupdates on our strategic priorities including an update on the JV with Volvo. Bill will\nthen walk us through our Q3 results and provide some commentary on the ATM offering\nthat we announced in the quarter.\nQ3 was a steady quarter with wins in key areas. This was the first full quarter with\nCespira being operational. That along with the steps that we have taken with respect to\ncost cutting, has enabled Westport to lower expenditures in research and development, as\nwell as sales general and administrative expenses by approximately 40% as compared to\nthe same period last year.\nThis has all led to improved gross margins in adjusted EBITDA. Although we reported a\ndecrease in total revenue this quarter, we view our revenue results for the quarter as a\nwin, and I want to provide some clarity as to why.\nAs I mentioned, this is the first full quarter with Cespira being operational. That means\nwe transitioned our HPDI revenue from our heavy-duty OEM segment into the joint\nventure in the quarter and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting for\ninvestments.\nDuring the quarter, Cespira generated $16.2 million in revenue, more than offsetting our\nreported decline in consolidated revenue.\nWith respect to our HPDI joint venture, I want to provide a couple of different updates.\nThe background on its new name, my perspective on its first full quarter of operations\nand some insight into the partnership in China.\nFirst, JV unveiled its name as Cespira as part of its participation in the IAA, one of the\nmost important industry events for commercial vehicles, transport and logistics. The\nname Cespira, which combines espira meaning breathe out in Latin with a C for clean,\nperfectly embodies the joint venture’s mission and vision. Regarding the JV operations\nthird quarter revenue for Cespira was $16.2 million, a $2.7 million increase from the\nsame quarter last year, which was formally captured under our heavy-duty OEM\nsegment.\nNext, I want to touch on our work with Weichai, as you know we have a technology\ndevelopment and supply agreement, which includes an obligation for Weichai to order\ncertain volumes of HPDI fuel system components prior to the end of this year. Currently,\nwe have not received any significant orders against this agreement and we don't currently\nanticipate orders for any significant additional volume by the end of 2024.\nBoth Westport and as well as Cespira continue to collaborate with Weichai Power on an\nHPDI fuel system equipped version of the Weichai engine platforms, and we are\ncurrently discussing the next stages of this work and the obligations of each party going\nforward.\nWe continue to do things to right-size the business and cut costs where we can. Many of\nthese changes aren't visible in the financial statements immediately.\nHowever, in Q3 2024, we really began to see some of our initiatives materialize. Given\nthis is the first quarter with Cespira operational, some of our expenses of course will now\nbe reflected as part of Cespira. Yet we are also seeing wins in our other business units.\nDuring the quarter, we decreased the company's SG&A expenses by almost 40% as\ncompared to third quarter of last year, a decrease of $6.6 million of which only $2.3\nmillion relates to expenses that now sit in Cespira.\nThis is a major accomplishment that I'd like to highlight, further, our R&D expenses also\ndecreased by over 40% compared to the same quarter of last year a $2.5 million\ndifference in expenses mostly attributable to Cespira.\nWe'll continue to remain diligent when it comes to cost cutting and decreasing expenses,\nensuring that the business runs more efficiently and effectively over time.\nWe are pleased with our progress so far, but acknowledge that there is still much work\nahead of us on this front.\nWe remain confident in the role that alternative fuels will play in driving sustainability in\nthe future of transportation and industrial application spaces.\nWe do see a slowdown in hydrogen infrastructure development, which is leading to a\nslower adoption of automotive and industrial applications powered by hydrogen.\nWe believe that it could be a multi-year delay when it comes to the availability of low\ncost, low carbon, hydrogen, and hydrogen refueling infrastructure.\nHowever, we remain confident on the role that hydrogen will play in driving\nsustainability in the future of transportation and industrial application spaces and in the\nfuture of Westport, while hydrogen is key to the future decarbonization of transport, our\ncomponents and solutions are already powering emission, reducing innovation today\nacross a range of alternative fuels including natural gas, renewable natural gas, propane,\nand hydrogen.\nWith decades of experience, market leading brands and unmatched engineering expertise,\nwe are a leader in the market.\nOur light-duty segment has been performing well.\nWe continue to focus on innovation, creating and deploying fuel system solutions that\nallow our customers to benefit from the cost advantage of alternative fuels.\nAs you know we started production earlier this year for the Euro six LPG program for a\nleading global OEM. Although, we got off to a slow start earlier in the year, this business\nis performing well and we are expecting to exceed our delivery expectations for 2024,\ndriven by an increased customer demand. Euro seven LPG fuel system deliveries for the\nsame global OEM customer are anticipated to begin mid to late 2025.\nWe are also excited to be part of the new Kia Niro Tri-Fuel in Italy inspired by\ninnovation and efficiency. Born from a partnership with Kia, Italy. This is the first ever\nOEM hybrid vehicle powered by HEV and LPG technologies. This car can travel over\n1,600 kilometers or almost 1,000 miles on full tanks, all while delivering reduced\nemissions and uncompromised performance.\nFinally, our prince brand is globally released an LPG fuel system for the RAM 1500\nHurricane 3.0 DI Twin Turbo engine that enabling customers to benefit from lower fuel\ncosts and lower emissions. Lastly, as we have shared before, one of our key delayed\nOEM customers paused orders as they worked through a buildup of inventory on their\nend.\nOrders from this customer have seen an uptick over the last month and we continue to\nwork closely with their team.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our Q3 2024 financial results in more detail.\nBill Larkin: Good morning and thank you, Dan.\nMoving to our third quarter results, this is the first fourth quarter with Cespira being\noperational and as Dan mentioned, we're accounting for Cespira under the equity method\nof accounting for investments. Therefore, our third quarter P&L only includes our 55%\ninterest for the net loss of Cespira.\nThe third quarter of 2024, we generated $66.2 million in revenue, which was a 14%\ndecrease compared to the prior year period. This decline of revenue was primarily driven\nby the heavy-duty OEM business, which is now conducted in Cespira. Cespira generated\nrevenue of $16.2 million in the quarter, this is up from $13.5 million in same quarter as\nlast year.\nGross margin increased to $14.5 million or 22% of revenue in the third quarter of ‘24.\nThis is up from $13.2 million or 17% of revenue in Q3 of 2023. This improvement was\nlargely driven by an increase in sales volumes and our light-duty business, along with the\nchange in sales mix with an increase in sales to European customers in addition to seeing\nthe initial improvements from our cost cutting initiatives. These were partially offset by a\nreduction in sales to developing regions.\nWe continue to demonstrate improvement in our adjusted EBITDA.\nNow this quarter we recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of $800,000, which was a\nsignificant improvement over the $3 million adjusted EBITDA loss recorded in the prior\nyear period. Light-duty revenue for Q3 2024 was $61.5 million as compared to $60.2\nmillion for Q3 of ‘23. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in sales in our\nlight-duty OEM and independent aftermarket businesses partially offset by decrease in\nour sales and our fuel storage, DOEM and electronics businesses.\nGross margin in our light-duty business increased in the quarter to $13.9 million or 23%\nof revenue.\nNow this is compared to $12 million or 20% of revenue in Q3 of ‘23. This was primarily\ndriven by a change in sales mix with an increase in sales to European customers and a\nreduction in sales to developing regions.\nAs Dan mentioned, our light-duty segment continues to evolve our LPG fuel system\nsolution, providing more customers with cost competitive alternatives. This along with\nthe success we are seeing following the start of our plan zero six deliveries. This has\nenabled light-duty OEM to drive revenue and margin growth in the quarter.\nHigh pressure gas controls revenue for Q3 of ‘24 was $1.6 million.\nNow this would decrease as compared to $3.7 million for Q3 of ‘23. This is primarily\ndriven by a general slowdown we're seeing in the hydrogen markets. Gross margin\ndecrease in the quarter of $400,000 or 25% of revenue as compared to $1 million or 27%\nof revenue in Q3 of ‘23. Heavy-duty OEM revenue for the third quarter of 2024 is $3.1\nmillion. This is down $10.4 million compared to the same quarter last year.\nRevenue decrease was a result of the transfer and continuation of the heavy-duty business\nin Cespira. Revenue earned in the third quarter of 2024 relates to our transitional services\nagreement with Cespira, which is expected to be in place until early to mid-2025. Gross\nmargin in our heavy-duty OEM business in the third quarter of 2024 was flat compared to\nQ3 to ‘23.\nIt was up as a percentage of revenue for 1% in the prior year period compared to 6% in\nQ3 of 2024.\nRegarding liquidity, our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 was $33.3\nmillion. A decrease of $8.2 million as compared to the end of Q2 of 2024. That cash used\nby operating activities was $9.9 million. This change was primarily related to net cash\noutflows for inventory and timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities compared to the end of the second quarter, which were partially offset by a\nreduction in accounts receivable.\nSpecifically to inventory, inventory increased in the third quarter by $9.9 million as\ncompared to the end of the second quarter.\nInventory was primarily impacted by the ramp-up to support expected deliveries of Euro\nsix kits in Q4 and the heavy-duty business under the transitional services agreements.\nHowever, we were targeting inventory reduction back to more normal levels by the end\nof 2024.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $7.5 million in the quarter. Net cash used in\nfinancing activities was $7 million. This is primarily related to debt repayments including\nfully repaying and terminating a revolving credit facility.\nI want to provide an update on our ATM offering. The ATM was set up with the intention\nof providing added option optionality and flexibility to opportunistically raise capital.\nSince, we put the program in place in mid-September, we have not sold any shares under\nthe ATM program.\nWe will continue to do what is necessary to ensure we are adequately and fully\ncapitalized.\nWe remain focused on solidifying our balance sheets.\nWe've been actively implementing cost saving initiatives, which is reflected in the\nquarterly results we shared with you today.\nThank you. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Dan.\nDan Sceli: Thank you, Bill.\nBefore we wrap-up this quarter's earnings call I wanted to close with a few comments.\nAlthough I'm incredibly proud of the work we have done to date, we acknowledge that\nconsiderable work lies ahead as we look-forward.\nWestport is motivated by the possibilities that the future holds and is resolute in its\npursuit of innovation and sustainability. To reiterate regarding the global hydrogen\nmarket, we acknowledge the slowdown in infrastructure development that will likely lead\nto a slower adoption of automotive and industrial application powered by hydrogen.\nWe are steadfast in our belief that hydrogen is a fuel, although gradual, as opposed to\nimmediate will prevail and become the clean fuel source for the transport industry that is\nadopted worldwide.\nWe are committed to providing solutions that enable our customers to take advantage of\nlower emissions and lower costs, often provided by alternative fuels like LPG, CNG,\nLNG and in the future hydrogen.\nWe have many of these solutions in the market today and are committed to continuing to\nadvance decarbonization across the mobility sector.\nI want to thank everyone for being here.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the call for questions.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Colin Rusch with\nOppenheimer.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi, this is Andrew on for Colin. Just a couple of questions from\nus. You guys continue to make incremental progress on GM improvement.\nCould you guys speak to the contributions of pricing, supply chain optimization and mix\nthat are driving some of these improvements?\nBill Larkin: First of all, it's a little bit of improvements related to the supply chain.\nIt's just across the board and we're looking at every -- our entire cost structure from the\nsupply chain to labor to our manufacturing footprint.\nSo from a supply chain standpoint, it was just a small piece of the overall cost reduction.\nUnidentified Participant^ And just following up on that, can you guys speak to the\nevolution and maturation of non-transportation hydrogen applications and the opportunity\nfor Westport, particularly in Europe?\nDan Sceli: Not -- so you're talking about infrastructure?\nUnidentified Participant: Yes, particularly.\nDan Sceli: Yes.\nSo in the infrastructure segments, our high pressure controls and systems, business unit is\nwhere we play and with all of our pressure relief valves, tank valves, et cetera.\nWe do see some opportunities for some of our cryogenic pump products, but those\nmarkets are developing, we continue to play in those markets, and not just in Europe.\nIt's a global requirement for these types of components, whether it be in China or Europe.\nAnd so we're going to continue to push that business unit's technology.\nWe in fact, with our GFI brand, we've become the leader in the market in terms of\nperformance.\nUnidentified Participant: Thanks so much for that.\nI’d like to sneak one last one in.\nAs you guys look at the balance sheet, can you speak to what your medium-term working\ncapital and operational cash needs are and how you sort of expect to meet those needs?\nBill Larkin: Yes. So from a working capital standpoint we did have an increase in our\nworking capital.\nIt was mostly driven by our inventory. That was a big chunk of it, and we were just\nbuilding inventory to meet the expected demand from our, for Euro six kits in the fourth\nquarter, as well as for the heavy duty OEM business.\nWe expect, you know the inventory levels to come down significantly in the fourth\nquarter, and it's going to continue on into 2025.\nWe believe there's a lot of opportunities to reduce our inventory and improve our\ninventory turns going forward, which will reduce our working capital.\nOther areas, you know just because of the reduction in, you know revenues because it is\nseasonal. Typically our third quarter is the lowest quarter when it comes to revenues.\nWe did see that decline in AR.\nWe think there's some opportunities there to try to further reduce our DSOs and improve\nin collections on our AR reducing our working capital. And on the flip side, it just with\nthe timing of our accounts payable that drove up our working capital as well.\nSo we're going to try to better improve our payment management.\nSo it’s going to be a combination of those who try to actually, we want to reduce our\nworking capital next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Dayal with HC Wainwright.\nAmit Dayal: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Dan, congrats on a strong quarter.\nJust with respect to Cespira, is there, do we have a sense of how much sort of breakeven\nor gross margin positive level revenues will be? I know this was very early first quarter,\nbut you know do we need to be at like 20 plus million or 25 plus million per quarter to hit\npositive gross margins for that business?\nDan Sceli: Yes. It depends on the mix.\nIt's hard to peg a specific number because there's a split between, you know final product\nassembly parts versus aftermarket parts, the service of the trucks. And so that makes\nchanges a lot and it affects the numbers we would need.\nBut we're still working through, you know the setup of that business and, you know\ngetting it operational takes some time.\nWe obviously started five months ago and, so I don't think we can give it an exact\nnumber to that right now.\nAmit Dayal: Okay, understood. And with respect to Weichai, I know it hasn't really\ncontributed much the last few years. How should we think about, you know contribution\nfrom Weichai going forward? Looks like you are still sort of, you know maintaining a\nrelationship with them, but, you know should we factor anything from China or Weichai\nas a part of our future projections?\nDan Sceli: At this point I would say no.\nWe have no orders on that contract and, but the engagement continues. They are working\nwith us on the technology HPDI technology for the Chinese market. They're working\nthrough their engine development programs and doing their trials and so we're still\nengaged, but we have no orders at this point.\nAmit Dayal^ Okay. Understood. And then from a tariff perspective right after this\nelection, what is our exposure potentially to developments on that side especially for say\nthe U.S. market or business we do in the U.S. How are we sort of positioning for any\nheadwinds that may emerge from that front?\nDan Sceli: Yes.\nI actually look at it the other way.\nI see that, I think the runway for natural gas products primarily in North America in the\nU.S. on CNG, but we see an opportunity that we would like to take advantage of for a\nlonger runway and bigger volumes on natural gas.\nSo we're actually optimistic from this election outcome in that regard.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum.\nEric Stine: Just talking about hydrogen and that the infrastructure is in a bit of a\ntransition period. Just curious behind the scenes for HPDI and the joint venture, are you\nseeing any change to the activity of OEMs related to hydrogen? And I guess, you're fine\nif it's hydrogen or LNG or both but is there a change for OEMs related to hydrogen? Is\nthat driving people more to LNG or what are you seeing at this point?\nDan Sceli: Yes. I'd suggest Eric that we haven't actually felt any change in the -- on the\ndevelopment side, because obviously these development cycles take a number of years\nand the OEMs are still working forward on these plans.\nI think, they all the OEMs in the heavy market see the multiple propulsion systems\nthey're going to need, and they're going to continue to develop them. The pace of\ndevelopment, we haven't felt a change yet, but I suspect that we're going to see, some\nslowdowns in the development of hydrogen work.\nBut as you say, we've got the LNG solution that we're actually feeling volume increases\nalready. And it's a good balance to have. And that's one of the -- we think one of the\nstrengths of Westport is that we can in our multiple business units, we can run all the\nalternative fuels.\nWe have solutions today.\nSo whether hydrogen's 5-years or 10-years away, it doesn't matter to us.\nEric Stine: And you just mentioned in response to a previous question, just a nice\nrunway for natural gas products in the U.S.\nI'm curious, I know that in the past there's been some talk of HPDI interest in North\nAmerica.\nI know that one of the objectives of both Westport and Volvo was a second OEM in the\njoint venture.\nSo just wondering if you can speak to those topics.\nDan Sceli: Yes. We continue to work with a second OEM to bring them on board. That\nwork is going to continue throughout the rest of the year here. And I can't tell you\ndefinitively when that will be complete however much I would like to, but we will bring\non a second OEM that is our mission, it's the mandate of the joint venture to have\nmultiple OEMs that was one of the key structures of the deal with Volvo, was to ensure\nthat we had an independent business that could attract other OEMs.\nAnd we're finding the strategy of the OEMs wanting multiple propulsion systems because\nthe segment is going to be needing different solutions.\nIt's going to play right into our hands.\nSo it is going to, it's not coming as fast as we want, but it's coming.\nEric Stine: Got it. And then, I mean I would assume then that that interest, and I know\nyou're talking about a second one, but more broadly would potentially include something\nin the U.S. at some point, maybe a CNG version.\nI think you've mentioned that in the past.\nDan Sceli: Yes. We're working that angle as well pretty hard. And we absolutely believe\nthere's a place for it in North America. And you know I think the question I got earlier\nabout the U.S. election and the impact on these segments, I think it's going to work well\nfor us to give us some pressure on the market to deliver a CNG solution. And we are\ntalking to multiple OEMs in North America, and we'll continue to position ourselves to\nbe a solution for them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets.\nRob Brown^ Just wanted to get a sense on your thoughts on like the gross margin, the\ngross margin you can get to as you take costs out you have good improvement this\nquarter, but what's the -- what's the sense of how much improvement you think you can\nget there?\nBill Larkin: Well I think for the quarter we were really happy on where we landed on the\ngross margin. You know I don't think we're in a position to provide, you know guidance\nlooking-forward.\nHowever, you know the process is not over.\nI think there's still a lot more work to do across all the input costs, whether it's material\ncosts, direct labor, fixed manufacturing.\nWe are continuing to review look at the entire cost structure and cost to deliver our\nproducts, kits, systems, components to our end customers.\nSo I'll leave it at that, but we're still looking at it, Rob.\nDan Sceli: Yes, Rob, one of the important things is we're not just, you know we're not\njust content with improving our gross margins today.\nOne of the things we're doing is putting in place operational processes to ensure that we\ncan hold onto them.\nAs we all know that in the industrial space the cost structures are quite sometimes\nvolatile, whether it's on the raw materials or energy, et cetera.\nOur goal is to not just fix this foundation, but put in place a business process that can\nhold it and maintain it.\nRob Brown: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then I guess on the, I think you talked about a\nEuro seven shift happening in ‘25.\nWhat's sort of your opportunity there and do you see sort of any transition kind of timing\nslow down or is this incremental to where you're at today?\nBill Larkin: No. I think are you referring to the light-duty business, Rob? So if you're\nreferring to light-duty business, yes.\nWe expect it, we will start transitioning to, you know delivering Euro seven kits.\nI expect it'll be a very seamless transition from Euro six to Euro 7.\nWe're already producing those components, going through the final certification\nprocesses and delivering the components.\nSo you know we're prepared to start delivering those components, next year. And so\nthere's really no disruption from a production standpoint, switching from Euro six to Euro\n7.\nRob Brown: And then last question on the heavy-duty business, do you see the kind of\nthe pipeline increasing there? We've heard indications that's happening. Are you seeing\nkind of an uptick in overall demand in that market kind of in next year?\nDan Sceli: Yes.\nWe're seeing it now.\nOur volumes are increasing, and we're working hard to meet all the volume increases that\nwe're being asked to meet. And we're actually quite excited about that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from MacMurray Whale with Cormark Securities.\nMacMurray Whale: Cost cutting efforts.\nIs the plan to bring, to get to EBITDA break-even sustainably on a quarterly basis?\nBill Larkin: Yes, of course --\nDan Sceli: That's where we're targeting absolutely we want to get there and then -- and\nof course maintain it. Just like my comment to Rob, getting things where we want them is\nstep one, maintaining them with some good business practices is just as important.\nMacMurray Whale: So digging into that a little bit, is that, are you confident that is,\nthat's an operational set of changes or do you, are there still parts of the business that\nneed to be restructured or sold outright? I mean how are -- where are you on that process\nof restructuring or sort of rightsizing the organization?\nDan Sceli: There's still work to do there. Absolutely, for us to get this business in a\nposition and position that we can be sustainably improving earnings.\nSo yes, more work to do on the restructuring and reorganizing of the business. And I\nthink you nodding, we talked about this before, it's not like a light switch. This is going to\ntake some time and especially doing business in Europe, things don't happen as fast as I\nwould like them, but they're happening and we're getting momentum and that's the thing\nthat I'm excited about is the momentum that we've got going now in fixing the business\nand building a strong future.\nMacMurray Whale: So if just trying to put together sort of an outlook, is that a process\nthat takes, like is it a question of a few quarters or is it a year?\nDan Sceli: It's not quarters. Unfortunately it's not quarters and it is going to take another\nyear at least to get everything completed and but we're committed to it. That's the thing\nwe see clearly what we can be down the road, and we're working hard to execute and\nachieve those targets.\nMacMurray Whale: Cespira is all the interaction with Weichai through the JV?\nDan Sceli: Yes.\nMacMurray Whale: So when you talk about a bringing in a second OEM, presumably\nthat's not Weichai?\nDan Sceli: Correct.\nMacMurray Whale: And is the second OEM preference North America, there's nothing\nprecluding one to be in another one in Europe?\nDan Sceli: No. It's not.\nMacMurray Whale: And then just lastly on, you talked somewhat already about the\nhydrogen infrastructure, but I'm just taking a big step backward. When you look at your\nexperience in Gaius carbon fuels, where are we in that process on the infrastructure side?\nAre we is it 10 years ago, 15 years ago, or is it like five years? Like, where I'm just trying\nto get a handle on, even if you see continued work on the engine side, it's the\ninfrastructure that's really an issue.\nSo any comments on where you would sort of benchmark us in terms of that?\nDan Sceli: I think we've got a couple of things happening here.\nI think we've got an industry that needs to get to critical mass in the production of and the\ninfrastructure to supply and deliver hydrogen and other gaseous fuels.\nI think that we are well established on the LNG and CNG side, CNG in North America,\nLNG in Europe.\nFor hydrogen critical mass is probably further out.\nI mean everything I'm reading that tells me that it's further out than I would like, it could\nbe seven, eight years out before we start getting some critical mass.\nAt the end of the day, total cost of ownership is going to drive the market and the cost of\nhydrogen today is still far too high to make a lot of sense. And it is not any different than\nbattery electric or any other system.\nIt's all about critical mass. And once it's achieved, I think we're going to be fine.\nIt's a matter of how quickly we can get there. And each country's got its own plans for\ninvestments in that, and the markets have their plans.\nIt's -- I wish I had a crystal ball, but we still believe in it.\nI think the markets still believe in it.\nIt's just a timing issue.\nMacMurray Whale: Okay. And do you, sorry, last one, if I can just jump one more time.\nGiven that, given the differences in the countries and given how important it's for the JV\nis getting a second OEM in North America aligned with that?\nDan Sceli: I think we want a -- I'll call it a third OEM in North America, not a second.\nI mean second is critical.\nWe've got to get the third.\nI think we're going to see the markets develop differently. Today legislation in Europe is\nworking in our favor, whereas in the U.S. there's work to be done on the legislative front\nto make these solutions acceptable.\nAnd I think we're going to see, you know with the recent election, I think we're going to\nsee some wiggle room coming on that side in the U.S. and then you've got China, China\nis still the largest market.\nI think there's 150,000 trucks sold this year on LNG in China.\nIt's a massive market. And you know while we're frustrated about the Weichai situation\ntoday, it's still a market that demands attention.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with TD Cowen.\nJeff Osborne: Just a couple quick ones on my side. You mentioned the pickup in the\ndelayed OEM customer, they're in Italy.\nCan you just characterize that or are we half of where we were at normalized run rate\nbefore the inventory builds or any perspective on the improvement?\nDan Sceli: Yes. I'm trying to think of exactly how to answer that. The, I think what\nyou're asking me is the volume picking up from the delay we had at the beginning of the\nyear due to the inventory buildup?\nJeff Osborne: Yes, exactly.\nIf they were running a hundred cars a quarter in the past or a hundred a week and did it\ngo down to 20 and you're back up to 50? I'm just trying to get a sense of the inflection for\nthat customer given it was --\nDan Sceli: No. I don't have the exact number off the tip of my tongue, but I think we're\nmore than halfway back.\nBill Larkin: Yes.\nI think, you know we've substantially recovered since I call it the first half of the year.\nAnd I would say we're more at a normal run rate for that customer in delivering kits.\nJeff Osborne: And maybe just to follow-up on a prior answer you gave about the\nrecovery in the light duty market.\nCan you be more specific as to which countries you're seeing that? Is that in Italy itself,\nwhere you have a strong presence or Eastern Europe or South America? Any perspective\nthere would be helpful.\nDan Sceli: I think a lot of it's in Europe for principally the LPG markets, that's where\nwe're seeing a lot of the pickup, when you look at, I see more of the emerging markets.\nIt’s a lot more choppy because a lot of the emerging markets are driven by tenders. And\nso that can swing a quarter or a year by several million dollars depending on the timing of\nthose tenders.\nBut we look at this quarter, a lot of it is just the sale of LPG systems within Europe\nmostly in Italy and Eastern Europe.\nJeff Osborne: And then just two other quick ones here on Cespira. Double clicking out\nbeyond the second or third customer.\nIs there anything operationally or sales integration wise that you would say? We'll\ncharacterize there the two biggest objectives over the next six months or so?\nDan Sceli: What we're actually structured with enough capacity on both the supply and\nassembly side that we can bring on second and third OEM right now and any addition, so\nwe bring on a second OEM let's say tomorrow, theoretically, what we're kicking off is\nengine development program, and the revenues won't come in for a few years, it's not an\ninstantaneous thing.\nWe have to tune the system to their engine.\nAnd so, as a business, it is structured and ready to take on additional volume, whether it's\nwith the current customer or additional customers.\nSo there's no roadblocks or speed bumps to get in the way of that, but we've got to get the\ndevelopment work done first.\nJeff Osborne: My last one maybe for Bill is just the cash needs going forward.\nIs there a way you can quantify, I think you said it was Euro six for the inventory. There's\nsort of multiple pieces here at play. You're five months into a JV. There's still some\nrestructuring left to do over the next year, it sounds like. Plus you have the one one-time\ninventory, Bill, but at the current run rate revenue, is there a way to think about like what\nnormalized cash burn would be, and then how that can improve going forward?\nBill Larkin: We're trying to turn the tide on that and it's -- we're hitting it on all fronts in\nterms of cost reductions, trying to enhance our margins, trying to implement operational\nefficiencies, which also include inventory management, accounts receivable, as I\nmentioned fourth quarter we expect are working capital, the inventory to come back\ndown to more work normalized levels, that'll help free up some cash during the quarter.\nAnd it's about continue to improve upon that, and sustainability of trying to reduce our\nworking capital. Really it's kind of operate more efficiently and to fund our operations.\nSo as of right now that's what we're focused on -- try to eliminate the cash burn.\nJeff Osborne: And to that point, I mean you had pretty sizable cash burn in a quarter\nrelative to our expectations, but you chose not to use the ATM. Was that more a function\nof the stock price or just a expected or anticipated improvement in Q4?\nBill Larkin: Yes. It is just the ATM it just takes, I think, the ATM, we probably should\nput in place when we put the original shelf, when we filed the original shelf. And it is\njust, it is there, it is it's just to have, if there's an opportunity to shore up the balance\nsheets, we will leverage that.\nBut as of right now we have not issued any shares under the ATM.\nOperator: That concludes today's question and answer session.\nI'd like to turn the call back to Dan Sceli for closing remarks.\nDan Sceli: Well thank you very much everybody, for your participation.\nAs you can tell from our call today, we're very excited about the momentum and the\nprogress we're making in right sizing and stabilizing this business.\nWe're excited about the future of our technology and its place in the alternative fuels.\nAnd we're going to continue to work very hard to ensure that we put in place the business\nprocesses to maintain the gains that we're getting.\nThank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.\nYou may now disconnect."

Our diverse product offerings, sold under a wide range of established global brands, enable the\nuse of a number of alternative fuels in the transportation sector that provide environmental and/or economic advantages as\ncompared to diesel, gasoline, batteries or fuel cell powered vehicles. The Company's fuel systems and associated components\ncontrol the pressure and flow of these alternative fuels, including liquefied petroleum gas (\"LPG\"), compressed natural gas\n(\"CNG\"), liquified natural gas (\"LNG\"), renewable natural gas (\"RNG\") or biomethane, and hydrogen. We supply our products\nin approximately 70 countries through a network of distributors, service providers for the aftermarket and directly to OEMs and\nTier 1 and Tier 2 OEM suppliers. We also provide delayed OEM (“DOEM”) offerings and engineering services to our\ncustomers and partners globally. Today, our products and services are available for passenger car and light-, medium- and\nheavy-duty truck and off-road applications.\nThe majority of our revenues are generated through the following four business lines:\nCespira (formerly the HPDI Joint Venture)\nWestport owns a 55% interest in Cespira with Volvo Group owning the remaining 45%. Cespira sells systems and components,\nincluding LNG HPDI 2.0 fuel system products, to engine OEMs and commercial vehicle OEMs. Cespira's fully integrated LNG\nHPDI 2.0 fuel systems enable diesel engines using primarily natural gas fuel to match the power, torque, and fuel economy\nbenefits found in traditional compression ignition engines, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and the capability to\ncost-effectively run on renewable fuels. Also, the joint venture is adapting their HPDI fuel systems to use hydrogen or\nhydrogen/natural gas blends in internal combustion engines.\nLight-Duty Business\nOur Light-Duty segment manufactures LPG and CNG solutions and supply fuel storage tanks to the aftermarket, OEM, and\nother market segments across a wide range of brands. The Light-Duty segment includes the consolidated results from our\ndelayed OEM, independent aftermarket, light-duty OEM operations, electronics and fuel storage businesses.\nThe light-duty OEM business line sells systems and components to OEMs that are used to manufacture new, LPG or CNG-\nfueled vehicles. The Independent Aftermarket (“IAM”) business sells systems and components across a wide range of brands,\nprimarily through a global network of distributors that consumers can purchase and have installed onto their vehicles to use\nLPG or CNG fuels, in addition to gasoline. The Delayed OEM (“DOEM”) business line directly or indirectly converts new\npassenger cars for OEMs or importers to address local market needs when a global LPG or CNG bi-fuel vehicle platform is not\navailable directly from the OEM. The Electronics business line designs, industrializes and assembles electronic control\nmodules. The Fuel Storage business line manufactures LPG fuel storage solutions and supplies fuel storage tanks to the\naftermarket, OEM, and other market segments.\nHigh-Pressure Controls & Systems\nOur High-Pressure Controls & Systems business designs, develops, produces and sells components for transportation and\nindustrial applications.We partner with the world’s leading fuel cell and hydrogen engine manufacturers and other companies\ncommitted to decarbonizing transport, offering solutions for a variety of fuel types.\nHeavy-Duty OEM Business\nOur Heavy-Duty OEM business represents historical results from our heavy-duty business for the period January 1 until the\nformation of the joint venture which occurred on June 3, 2024, and for comparative purposes, for the period January 1 to\nSeptember 30, 2023. Following the close of Cespira in June 2024, the results of this business are reflected in the Cespira\nbusiness segment. Going forward, the Heavy-Duty OEM segment will reflect revenue earned from a transitional services\nagreement in place with Cespira. This transitional services agreement is intended to support Cespira in the short-term as the\norganization transitions to its own operating entity.\n2\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nRISKS, LONG-TERM PROFITABILITY & LIQUIDITY\nGovernment Regulation and Inflationary Environment\nGovernment regulation is a key factor in driving accelerated global demand and adoption of reduced emission vehicles.\nSupportive government policy combined with rising corporate adherence to emission reduction goals are creating growth\ncatalysts for Westport in some of its key markets. While we have benefited historically from certain government environmental\npolicies, mandates and regulations around the world, there can be no assurance that these policies, mandates, and regulations\nwill be continued. If these are discontinued, if current requirements are relaxed, or if other regulations are implemented that\nmay impact our business, we may experience a material impact on our competitive position.\nWhile OEM production is back on track, inflationary pressure on production input costs continued to affect the automotive\nindustry and will continue to impact our business for the foreseeable future.\nFuel Prices\nTo date, there have been continued global gaseous price fluctuations including for LNG and CNG but also for liquid fuels\nincluding crude oil, diesel, and gasoline, which continue to persist, given uncertainty in supply levels, European geopolitical\nrisk due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and ongoing conflict in the Middle East impacting commodity prices. Higher gaseous\nfuel price negatively impacts the price differential of gaseous fuels versus diesel and gasoline, which may impact our customers'\ndecisions to adopt such gaseous fuels as a transportation energy solution in the short-term. Despite the uncertainty with CNG\nand LNG prices, the increased LPG price differential to gasoline in Europe continued in 2023 and to date in 2024 and was\nfavourable to customer demand for LPG components and kits.\nLong-term Profitability and Liquidity\nWe continue to observe inflationary pressures in some countries we operate in, global supply chain disruptions, higher interest\nrates and volatile fuel prices, which negatively affect customer demand going forward and have an adverse impact on our\nproduction and cost structure.\nWe believe that we have considered all possible impacts of known events arising from the risks discussed above related to\nsupply chain and fuel prices in the preparation of the interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. However, changes in circumstances due to the forementioned risks could affect our judgments and\nestimates associated with our liquidity and other critical accounting assessments.\nWe continue to sustain operating losses and use cash to support our operating activities primarily driven by increases in\nworking capital investments in our Light-Duty segment and lack of scale in our High-Pressure Controls & Systems segment.\nCash used in operating activities was $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs at September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $33.3 million. Although we believe we have sufficient liquidity\nto continue as a going concern beyond November 2025, the long-term financial sustainability of the Company will depend on\nour ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from all of our operations specifically through profitable, sustainable\ngrowth and on the ability to finance our long-term strategic objectives and operations. In addition to new contract\nannouncements, entering new markets, and formation of the HPDI joint venture with the Volvo Group, we are focused on\nimproving profitability through growth in our Light-Duty and High-Pressure Controls & Systems segments, driving economies\nof scale and improvements in our manufacturing operations including pricing measures, cost reductions, and manufacturing\nstrategies driving margin expansion. If, as a result of future events, we determine we were no longer able to continue as a going\nconcern, significant adjustments would be required to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the accompanying interim\nfinancial statements and the adjustments could be material.\n3\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nRevenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 14% to $66.2 million compared to $77.4 million in the\nsame quarter last year, primarily driven by the transition of the Heavy-duty OEM business into the HPDI joint venture. Cespira\nearned revenues of $16.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This business was reported as our Heavy-\nDuty OEM segment in the third quarter of 2023 and earned $13.5 million in revenue during that period, representing an\nincrease in the third quarter of 2024 of $3.3 million.\nWe reported a net loss of $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of $11.9 million\nfor the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by:\n• improvement in gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of $1.3 million compared to the prior\nyear quarter\n• reductions in operating expenditures and depreciation and amortization due to continuation of the HPDI business in\nCespira\n• change in foreign exchange gains and losses of $2.5 million from fluctuations in the Euro and Canadian Dollar against\nthe U.S. Dollar\nCash and cash equivalents were $33.3 million at the end of the third quarter 2024. Cash used in operating activities was $9.9\nmillion primarily from an increase in working capital of $11.4 million. Cash provided by investing activities included the sale\nof investments for $9.6 million related to the collection of $8.4 million from the formation of Cespira and sale of our ownership\ninterest in WWI, partially offset by the purchase of capital assets of $2.1 million. Cash used in financing activities were debt\nrepayments of $7.0 million in the quarter.\nWe reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $0.8 million, (see \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section in this MD&A) during the third\nquarter as compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 million for the same quarter last year.\n4\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nSELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our financial results:\nSelected Consolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for per share amounts and shares outstanding)\nRevenue $ 66.2 $ 77.4 $ 227.2 $ 244.7\nGross margin1 $ 14.5 $ 13.2 $ 43.3 $ 40.9\nGross margin %1 22 % 17 % 19 % 17 %\nIncome (loss) from investments accounted for by the\nequity method $ (2.8) $ 0.4 $ (3.4) $ 0.6\nNet loss $ (3.9) $ (11.9) $ (11.7) $ (35.8)\nNet loss per share - basic $ (0.22) $ (0.70) $ (0.68) $ (2.08)\nNet loss per share - diluted $ (0.22) $ (0.70) $ (0.68) $ (2.08)\nWeighted average basic shares outstanding in millions 17.3 17.2 17.2 17.2\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding millions 17.3 17.2 17.2 17.2\nEBIT1 $ (2.1) $ (11.8) $ (7.2) $ (34.2)\nEBITDA1 $ (0.3) $ (8.6) $ (0.5) $ (25.0)\nAdjusted EBITDA1 $ (0.8) $ (3.0) $ (9.4) $ (11.5)\n1These financial measures or ratios are non-GAAP financial measures or ratios.

As a result, the Company changed how it reviews and manages its business\nthrough five reportable segments: Light-Duty, High-Pressure Controls & Systems, Heavy-Duty OEM, Corporate, and Cespira.\nThis reflects the manner in which operating decisions and assessing business performance is currently managed by the Chief\nOperating Decision Maker (“CODM”).\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nOperating Income Depreciation & Equity Income\nRevenue (Loss) Amortization (Loss)\nLight-Duty $ 61.5 $ 2.4 $ 1.6 $ 0.2\nHigh-Pressure Controls & Systems 1.6 (1.2) 0.1 —\nHeavy-Duty OEM 3.1 0.9 — —\nCorporate — (1.0) 0.1 (3.0)\nCespira 16.2 (5.3) 0.9 —\nTotal segment 82.4 (4.2) 2.7 (2.8)\nLess: Cespira 16.2 (5.3) 0.9 —\nTotal consolidated $ 66.2 $ 1.1 $ 1.8 $ (2.8)\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nDepreciation &\nRevenue Operating Loss Amortization Equity Income\nLight-Duty $ 60.2 $ (3.0) $ 1.7 $ 0.4\nHigh-Pressure Controls & Systems 3.7 (0.4) 0.1 —\nHeavy-Duty OEM 13.5 (3.7) 1.3 —\nCorporate — (5.0) 0.1 —\nTotal consolidated $ 77.4 $ (12.1) $ 3.2 $ 0.4\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nThree months ended Nine months ended\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) September 30, Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nLight-Duty $ 61.5 $ 60.2 $ 1.3 2 % $ 194.2 $ 200.4 $ (6.2) (3) %\nHigh-Pressure Controls & Systems 1.6 3.7 (2.1) (57) % 7.4 9.4 (2.0) (21) %\nHeavy-Duty OEM 3.1 13.5 (10.4) (77) % 25.6 34.9 (9.3) (27) %\nTotal Revenue $ 66.2 $ 77.4 $ (11.2) (14) % $ 227.2 $ 244.7 $ (17.5) (7) %\nLight-Duty\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $61.5 million and $194.2 million, respectively,\ncompared with $60.2 million and $200.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nLight-Duty revenue increased by $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year\nquarter. This was primarily driven by an increase in sales in our light-duty OEM and IAM businesses, partially offset by a\ndecrease in sales in our fuel storage, DOEM and electronics businesses.\n6\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nLight-Duty revenue decreased by $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year\nperiod. This was primarily driven by a decrease in sales in our DOEM and fuel storage businesses, partially offset by an\nincrease in sales in our light-duty OEM, electronics and IAM businesses.\nHigh-Pressure Controls & Systems\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively, compared\nwith $3.7 million and $9.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods was\nprimarily driven by the general slowdown in the hydrogen infrastructure development, leading to a slower adoption of\nautomotive and industrial applications powered by hydrogen.\nHeavy-Duty OEM\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes revenue until the closing of the transaction to form\nCespira, which occurred on June 03, 2024. Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.1 million\nand $25.6 million, respectively, compared with $13.5 million and $34.9 million for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023.\nThe decrease in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is a result of the continuation of the business\nin Cespira.

However, due to its significance to our long-term strategy and\noperating results, we disclose of certain Cespira's financial information in notes 8 and 19 in our interim financial statements for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and the period from June 3, 2024 to September 30, 2024.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the financial results of Cespira for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\nthe period between June 3, 2024 to September 30, 2024:\nThree months ended Period ended\nSeptember 30, Change September 30, Change\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) 2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nRevenue $ 16.2 $ — $ 16.2 — % $ 20.3 $ — $ 20.3 — %\nGross margin1 (1.1) — (1.1) — % (0.9) — (0.9) — %\nGross margin %1 (7) % — % (4) % — %\nOperating loss (5.3) — (5.3) — % (7.3) — (7.3) — %\nNet loss attributable to the Company (3.0) — (3.0) — % (4.1) — (4.1) — %\n1Gross margin and gross margin % are non-GAAP financial measures. See the section 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' for\nexplanations and discussions of these non-GAAP financial measures or ratios.\nRevenue\nCespira earned $16.2 million for three months ended September 30, 2024. For the prior year quarter, the Heavy-Duty OEM\nsegment included our HPDI business and earned $13.5 million. The revenue increase was primarily driven by an increase in\nHPDI systems sold.\nGross margin\nCespira had negative $1.1 million on gross margin for three months ended September 30, 2024. For the prior year quarter, the\nHeavy-Duty OEM segment earned $0.2 million.\nOperating loss\nCespira had operating losses of $5.3 million three months ended September 30, 2024. For the prior year quarter, the Heavy-\nDuty OEM had operating losses of $3.7 million.\n10\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOther significant expense and income items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nForeign exchange gains and losses reflect net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and net unrealized\ngains and losses on our net U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities in our Canadian operations that were mainly\ncomprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. In addition, we have foreign exchange\nexposure on Euro denominated monetary assets and liabilities where the functional currency of the subsidiary is not the Euro.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized foreign exchange gains of $1.1 million and foreign\nexchange losses $0.8 million, respectively, compared to foreign exchange losses of $1.4 million and $4.9 million for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The gain recognized in the current quarter primarily relates to\nunrealized foreign exchange gains resulting from the translation of U.S. dollar denominated debt in our Canadian legal entities.\nDepreciation and amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.8 million and $6.8 million,\ncompared to $3.2 million and $9.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The amounts\nincluded in cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.0 million and $4.2 million,\nrespectively, compared with $2.1 million and $6.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily\ndriven by the transition of the HPDI business into Cespira on June 3, 2024.\nIncome (loss) from investments primarily relates to our 55% interest in Cespira's earnings and losses accounted for by the\nequity method and our 24% interest in Minda Westport Technologies Limited. See the \"Selected Cespira Statement of\nOperations information\" section in this MD&A for more detail.\nInterest on long-term debt and amortization of discount\nThree months ended Nine months ended\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest expense on long-term debt $ 0.9 $ 0.6 $ 2.1 $ 1.9\nRoyalty payable accretion expense — — — 0.2\nTotal interest on long-term debt and accretion on royalty payable $ 0.9 $ 0.6 $ 2.1 $ 2.1\nThe increase in interest expense on long-term debt for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year\nquarter was primarily driven by the new loans in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million and $3.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\nincome tax recovery of $0.1 million and income tax expense of $1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily driven by increase in taxes from higher profitability in\nour European operations.\n11\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nOur cash and cash equivalents position decreased by $8.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 to $33.3 million from $41.5\nmillion at June 30, 2024 and decreased by $21.6 million in the nine months of 2024 from $54.9 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe decrease in cash during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by cash used in operating and\nfinancing activities, partially offset by cash provided by investing activities.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in operating activities was $9.9 million, a decrease of $10.5\nmillion from net cash provided of $0.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in\noperating activities was primarily driven by net cash outflows for inventory, accounts payables and accrued liabilities, and\nprepaid expenses compared to the prior year quarter. They were partially offset by net cash inflows from reduction in trade\naccounts receivable in the Heavy-Duty OEM and Light-Duty segments.\nThe global supply chain disruptions and inflation continue to challenge the automotive industry with rising manufacturer costs.\nWe are responding with pricing and productivity countermeasures to manage our profitability. For further discussion, see the\n\"Long-term Profitability and Liquidity\" sections in this MD&A. These conditions continue to persist. Consequently, the\nduration and severity of the impact on future quarters is currently uncertain.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by investing activities was $7.5 million compared to net\ncash used of $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by investing\nactivities was primarily driven by proceeds from sale of investments of $9.6 million, partially offset by capital investments of\n$2.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Proceeds from sale of investments include $8.4 million related to\nthe formation of Cespira, and $1.1 million for sale of investment in WWI.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in financing activities was $7.0 million compared to net cash\nused in financing activities of $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the current quarter, we fully\nrepaid our revolving facility and continued to repay our existing term loan facilities.\n12\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nCarrying Contractual\namount cash flows < 1 year 1 - 3 years 4-5 years > 5 years\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 88.8 $ 88.8 $ 88.8 $ — $ — $ —\nLong-term debt, principal, (1) 38.7 34.1 3.5 27.1 3.5 —\nLong-term debt, interest (1) — 6.0 0.4 4.5 1.1 —\nOperating lease obligations (2) 20.4 23.4 0.7 7.8 4.7 10.2\n$ 147.9 $ 152.3 $ 93.4 $ 39.4 $ 9.3 $ 10.2\nNotes\n(1) For details of our long-term debt, principal and interest, see note 14 in our interim financial statements.\n(2) For additional information on operating lease obligations, see note 12 of our interim financial statements.\nSHARES OUTSTANDING\nOn September 13, 2024, we announced an at-the-market equity offering program (the \"ATM Program\") that allows us to issue\nup to $35.0 million in common shares from treasury to the public from time to time, at our discretion and subject to regulatory\nrequirements. As at September 30, 2024, no shares were issued from treasury.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the weighted average number of shares used in\ncalculating the basic and diluted net loss per share was 17,241,469 and 17,172,429, respectively.

We have identified several policies as\ncritical to our business operations and in understanding our results of operations. These policies, which require the use of\njudgment, estimates and assumptions in determining their reported amounts, include the assessment of liquidity and going\nconcern, warranty liability, revenue recognition, inventories and property, plant and equipment. The application of these and\nother accounting policies are described in note 3 of our annual consolidated financial statements and our MD&A, for the year\nended December 31, 2023, filed on March 25, 2024. Actual amounts may vary significantly from estimates used. There have\nbeen no significant changes in accounting policies applied to the September 30, 2024 interim financial statements and we do not\nexpect to adopt any significant changes at this time.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\")\n2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,\" to enhance disclosures for\nsignificant segment expenses for all public entities required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280. The\namendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. Retrospective adoption is required for all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We plan\nto adopt the standard beginning with our 2024 annual consolidated financial statements. We are currently assessing the impacts\nof this ASU and expects it to impact disclosures with no impact to its operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements in Income Tax Disclosures\" to\nenhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This amendment requires public companies to\ndisclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a\nquantitative threshold. Additionally, under the amendment entities are required to disclose the amount of income taxes paid\ndisaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes, as well as disaggregated by material individual jurisdictions. Finally, the\namendment requires entities to disclose income from continuing operations before income tax expense disaggregated between\ndomestic and foreign and income tax expense from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. The new\nrules are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We will adopt this standard on a prospective basis as\nallowed by the standard. We are currently assessing the impacts of this ASU and expects it to impact disclosures with no impact\nto its operations, cash flows or financial position.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n14\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nOur revenues and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of product deliveries,\nproduct mix, product launch dates, R&D project cycles, timing of related government funding, impairment charges,\nrestructuring charges, stock-based compensation awards and foreign exchange impacts. Net income and net loss has and can\nvary significantly from one quarter to another depending on operating results, gains and losses from investing activities,\nrecognition of tax benefits and other similar events.\nThe following table provides summary unaudited consolidated financial data for the past quarters as comparison :\nSelected Consolidated Quarterly Operations Data\n31- 31- 30- 30- 31- 31- 30- 30-\nThree months ended Dec-22 Mar-23 Jun-23 Sep-23 Dec-23 Mar-24 Jun-24 Sep-24\n(in millions of U.S. dollars except for per share amounts)\nTotal revenue $ 78.0 $ 82.2 $ 85.0 $ 77.4 $ 87.2 $ 77.6 $ 83.4 $ 66.2\nCost of revenue $ 73.5 $ 68.9 $ 70.6 $ 64.2 $ 79.2 $ 65.9 $ 66.3 $ 51.7\nGross margin1 $ 4.5 $ 13.3 $ 14.4 $ 13.2 $ 8.0 $ 11.7 $ 17.1 $ 14.5\nGross margin percentage1 5.8% 16.2% 16.9% 17.1% 9.2% 15.1% 20.5% 21.9%\nNet income (loss) $ (16.9) $ (10.6) $ (13.2) $ (11.9) $ (13.9) $ (13.6) $ 5.8 $ (3.9)\nEBITDA1 $ (13.5) $ (6.3) $ (10.1) $ (8.6) $ (10.9) $ (9.2) $ 9.0 $ (0.3)\nAdjusted EBITDA1 $ (12.9) $ (4.5) $ (4.0) $ (3.0) $ (10.0) $ (6.6) $ (2.0) $ (0.8)\nU.S. dollar to Euro average exchange rate 0.98 0.93 0.92 0.95 0.92 0.92 0.93 0.91\nU.S. dollar to Canadian dollar average exchange rate 1.36 1.35 1.34 1.35 1.35 1.35 1.37 1.36\nLoss per share\nBasic $ (1.00) $ (0.62) $ (0.77) $ (0.70) $ (0.81) $ (0.79) $ 0.34 $ (0.22)\nDiluted $ (1.00) $ (0.62) $ (0.77) $ (0.70) $ (0.81) $ (0.79) $ 0.33 $ (0.22)\nNotes\n(1) These financial measures or ratios are non-GAAP financial measures or ratios. See the section 'Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures' for explanations and discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures or ratios.\nNon-GAAP Measures:\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we used EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, gross margin,\ngross margin as a percentage of revenue, net working capital, and other non-current liabilities (collectively, the “Non-GAAP\nMeasures\") throughout this MD&A. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information that is useful to\nstakeholders in understanding our underlying performance and trends through the same financial measures employed by our\nmanagement. We believe that EBIT, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to both management and investors in their\nanalysis of our ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, service debt\nobligations and fund capital expenditures. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its review and evaluation of the\nfinancial performance of the Company. EBITDA is also frequently used by stakeholders for valuation purposes whereby\nEBITDA is multiplied by a factor or \"EBITDA multiple\" that is based on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA\nand market values to determine the approximate total enterprise value of a company. We believe these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures also provide additional insight to stakeholders as supplemental information to our U.S. GAAP results and as a basis to\ncompare our financial performance period-over-period and to compare our financial performance with that of other companies.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons of our core operating results from period to period\nand to other companies by, in the case of EBITDA, removing the effects of our capital structure (net interest income on cash\ndeposits, interest expense on outstanding debt and debt facilities), asset base (depreciation and amortization) and tax\nconsequences.

(“Westport\") (TSX:WPRT / Nasdaq:WPRT), a leading supplier of advanced alternative\nfuel systems and components for the global transportation industry, reported financial results for the third quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and provided an update on operations. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\n“Westport delivered solid results in the third quarter of 2024. Although revenue was down, this decrease was more than outweighed\nby the revenue earned at Cespira and we delivered significant improvement in Adjusted EBITDA. We continue to execute against\nour three strategic pillars - harnessing the potential of our HPDI joint venture, enhancing operational excellence, and driving\ncontinuous innovation to shape the world’s alternative-fueled future. The third quarter represented the first full quarter with Cespira,\nour HPDI joint venture with Volvo Group, being operational. This, along with the steps we have taken with respect to various cost\ncutting measures, has enabled Westport to decrease our costs including research and development as well as sales, general and\nadministrative expenses by approximately 40 percent as compared to the same period last year.\nWe remain confident in the role that alternative fuels will play in driving sustainability in the future of the transportation and\nindustrial application space. Regarding hydrogen, we acknowledge the slowdown in infrastructure development in the global market,\nwhich has tapered the adoption of automotive and industrial applications powered by hydrogen. The success of this market depends\non the installation of infrastructure and the production of clean hydrogen, both of which have been slow to materialize. However,\nwe are steadfast in our belief that hydrogen as a fuel will prevail – although gradual as opposed to immediate – and become a clean\nfuel source that is adopted worldwide. In the meantime, Westport currently delivers a suite of proven and innovative components\nand systems for a wide range of affordable alternative low-carbon fuels such as natural gas, renewable natural gas, propane, and\nhydrogen. We are driving cleaner performance by addressing lower emissions regulations with practical applications using innovation\navailable today.\nAs we navigate the next quarter, and the next year, Westport is strongly committed to driving operational excellence, nurturing\ninnovation, and supporting Cespira, all to position the Company for sustainable growth in an evolving landscape. We are focused\nand dedicated to the present and our future.\"\nDan Sceli, Chief Executive Officer, Westport Fuel Systems\nQ3 2024 Highlights\n• Revenues decreased by 14% to $66.2 million compared to $77.4 million in the same quarter last year, primarily driven by\nthe transition of the Heavy-Duty OEM revenues now being reflected in the results of Cespira, of which Westport accounts\nfor as an equity investment.\n• Net loss of $3.9 million for the quarter, an improvement over the net loss of $11.9 million for the same quarter last year.\nThis was primarily the result of an improvement in gross margin by $1.3 million compared to the prior year quarter, a\nsignificant decrease in operating expenditures and depreciation and amortization as costs previously associated with our\nHPDI business are now accrued by Cespira, cost reductions in Westport and a net foreign exchange gain of $1.1 million.\nWESTPORT FUEL SYSTEMS INC. » 1\n• Continued improvement in Adjusted EBITDA[2] achieving negative $0.8 million compared to negative $3.0 million for the\nsame period in 2023.\n• Cash and cash equivalents were $33.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Cash used in operating activities was\n$9.9 million primarily from an increase in working capital of $11.4 million. Cash provided by investing activities included\nthe sale of investments for $9.6 million related to the collection of $8.4 million from the formation of the HPDI JV and sale\nof our ownership interest in Westport Weichai Inc. (\"Weichai\"), partially offset by the purchase of capital assets of $2.1\nmillion. Cash used in financing activities represented debt repayments of $7.0 million in the quarter.\n• In September 2024, HPDI Technology, the joint venture between Volvo Group and Westport, launched as Cespira.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nOver / Over /\n(Under) (Under)\n($ in millions, except per share amounts) 3Q24 3Q23 % 9M24 9M23 %\nRevenues $ 66.2 $ 77.4 (14) % $ 227.2 $ 244.7 (7) %\nGross Margin(2) 14.5 13.2 10 % 43.3 40.9 6 %\nGross Margin %(2) 22 % 17 % 19 % 17 %\nIncome (loss) from Investments Accounted\n(2.8) 0.4 (800) % (3.4) 0.6 (670) %\nfor by the Equity Method(1)\nNet Loss $ (3.9) $ (11.9) 68 % $ (11.7) $ (35.8) 67 %\nNet Loss per Share - Basic $ (0.22) $ (0.70) 69 % $ (0.68) $ (2.08) 67 %\nNet Loss per Share - Diluted $ (0.22) $ (0.70) 69 % $ (0.68) $ (2.08) 67 %\nEBITDA(2) $ (0.3) $ (8.6) 97 % $ (0.5) $ (25.0) 98 %\nAdjusted EBITDA(2) $ (0.8) $ (3.0) 73 % $ (9.4) $ (11.5) 18 %\n(1) This includes income (loss) from Minda Westport Technologies Limited and Cespira.\n(2) Gross margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Light-Duty revenue decreased by $6.2\nmillion compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by a decrease in sales in our DOEM, and fuel storage businesses and\npartially offset by an increase in sales in our light-duty OEM, electronics, and IAM businesses.\nGross margin increased by $1.9 million to $13.9 million, or 23% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to $12.0 million, or 20% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by a slight\nincrease in sales volumes, a change in sales mix with increases in sales to European customers and reduction in sales to developing\nregions.\nGross margin increased by $4.3 million to $41.4 million, or 21% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to $37.1 million, or 19% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by a\nchange in sales mix with an increase in sales to European customers and a reduction in sales to developing regions.\nWestport began supplying its Euro 6 LPG fuel system to its global OEM customer in early 2024. Despite a slower start to production\nthan anticipated, Westport expects to exceed planned Euro 6 LPG fuel system deliveries in 2024. This production supply agreement\nhas been instrumental in improving revenue and delivering higher margins, which more than offset the decline in revenue as a result\nof a key delayed OEM customer continuing to work through their inventory. Production for the Euro 7 LPG fuel system for the same\nglobal OEM customer is anticipated to begin mid-to-late 2025.\nThe Light-Duty segment continues to evolve our LPG fuel system solution, providing more customers with a cost-competitive\nalternative fuel solution. Recently, two new product platforms were announced utilizing our systems. Westport was excited to be\npart of the first-ever OEM hybrid vehicle powered by HEV and LPG technologies - the Kia Niro Tri-Fuel in Italy. This revolutionary\nproduct, born from Westport's historic partnership with Kia Italia, offers three fuel sources—petrol, electric, and LPG—delivering\nover 1,600 km on full tanks with reduced emissions and uncompromised performance. Westport also announced the global\navailability of a LPG fuel system for the RAM 1500 Hurricane 3.0 DI Twin Turbo engine, enabling customers to benefit from lower\nemissions and lower fuel costs.\nHigh-Pressure Controls & Systems Segment\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $1.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively, compared with\n$3.7 million and $9.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily driven by the general slowdown in the hydrogen\ninfrastructure development leading to a slower adoption of automotive and industrial applications powered by hydrogen.\nGross margin decreased by $0.6 million to $0.4 million, or 25% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to $1.0 million or 27% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin decreased by $0.9\nmillion to $1.5 million, or 20% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.4 million, or 26% of\nrevenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by lower sales volume in the quarter.\nWESTPORT FUEL SYSTEMS INC. » 3\nHeavy-Duty OEM Segment\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes revenue from the HPDI business from January 1 to\nJune 3, the closing date of the transaction to form Cespira plus revenue earned under a transitional services agreement. Revenue\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, compared with $13.5\nmillion and $34.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is a result of the transition of this business to Cespira and\nthe resulting change in accounting treatment. We continue to earn service revenue from Cespira under the transitional services\nagreement for the quarter, which is represented in this segment.\nGross margin was $0.2 million, or 6% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $0.2 million or 1%\nof revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin decreased by $1.0 million to $0.4 million, or 2% of\nrevenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.4 million, or 4% of revenue, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nSelected Cespira Statements of Operations Data\nWe account for Cespira using the equity method of accounting for investments.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the financial results of Cespira for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the\nperiod between June 3, 2024 to September 30, 2024:\nThree months ended Period ended\nSeptember 30, Change September 30, Change\n(in millions of U.S. dollars) 2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nRevenue $ 16.2 $ — $ 16.2 — % $ 20.3 $ — $ 20.3 — %\nGross margin1 $ (1.1) $ — $ (1.1) — % $ (0.9) $ — $ (0.9) — %\nGross margin %1 (7) % — % (4) % — %\nOperating loss $ (5.3) $ — $ (5.3) — % $ (7.3) $ — $ (7.3) — %\nNet loss attributable to the\nCompany\n$ (3.0) $ — $ (3.0) — % $ (4.1) $ — $ (4.1) — %\n(1) Gross margin is a non-GAAP measure.

For the prior year quarter, the Heavy-Duty\nOEM segment included our HPDI business which earned $13.5 million. The revenue increase is largely driven by an increase in HPDI\nsystems sold.\nCespira lost $1.1 million on gross margin for three months ended September 30, 2024. For the prior year quarter, the Heavy-Duty\nOEM segment earned $0.2 million.\nCespira had operating losses of $5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the prior year quarter, Heavy-\nDuty OEM had incurred operating losses of $3.7 million.\nAs previously announced, Westport and Weichai are parties to a technology development and supply agreement which contains an\nobligation for Weichai to order, and Westport to supply, certain volumes of HPDI fuel system components prior to December 31,\n2024. Significant orders for HPDI fuel system components against this agreement have not been received to date and we do not\ncurrently anticipate that orders for any significant additional volumes will be received prior to year end.

The Company defines\ngross margin as revenue less cost of revenue. The Company defines EBITDA as net income or loss from continuing operations before\nincome taxes adjusted for interest expense (net), depreciation and amortization. Westport Fuel Systems defines Adjusted EBITDA\nas EBITDA from continuing operations excluding expenses for stock-based compensation, unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss,\nand non-cash and other adjustments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a long-term indicator of operational performance since\nit ties closely to the business units’ ability to generate sustained cash flow and such information may not be appropriate for other\npurposes. Adjusted EBITDA includes the company's share of income from joint ventures.\nThe terms gross margin, gross margin as a percentage of revenue, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") and are not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity\npresented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing\nthe company's operating performance, investors should not consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute\nfor net loss or other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Among other things, EBITDA\nand Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the company's actual cash expenditures.
