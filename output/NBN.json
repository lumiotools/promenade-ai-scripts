Our small balance SBA 7(a) program with Newity LLC as our loan service provider has gained real traction. For the quarter, we originated $82.4 million, compared to $40.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and $9.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. During the current quarter we sold $63.1 million of the guaranteed portion of our SBA loans, compared with $26.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and $5.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We are reporting earnings of $2.11 per diluted common share, a return on average equity of 17.5%, and a return on average assets of 2.1%.”\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total assets were $3.94 billion, an increase of $807.7 million, or 25.8%, from total assets of $3.13 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\n1. The following table highlights the changes in the loan portfolio, including loans held for sale, for the three months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nLoan Portfolio Changes   \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 Balance| June 30, 2024 Balance| Change ($)| Change (%)  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nNational Lending Purchased| $| 2,420,883| $| 1,708,551| $| 712,332| 41.69| %  \nNational Lending Originated| 1,011,374| 981,497| 29,877| 3.04| %  \nSBA National| 66,919| 48,405| 18,514| 38.25| %  \nCommunity Banking| 21,426| 22,704| (1,278| )| (5.63| %)  \nTotal| $| 3,520,602| $| 2,761,157| $| 759,445| 27.50| %  \n  \nLoans generated by the Bank's National Lending Division for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $859.8 million, which consisted of $732.9 million of purchased loans at an average price of 90.7% of unpaid principal balance, and $126.9 million of originated loans.\n\nAn overview of the Bank’s National Lending Division portfolio follows:\n\nNational Lending Portfolio  \n---  \nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n2024| 2023  \nPurchased| Originated| Total| Purchased| Originated| Total  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nLoans purchased or originated during the period:  \nUnpaid principal balance| $| 807,733| $| 126,893| $| 934,626| $| 63,695| $| 68,042| $| 131,737  \nInitial net investment basis (1)| 732,893| 126,893| 859,786| 52,346| 68,042| 120,388  \nLoan returns during the period:  \nYield| 8.83| %| 9.31| %| 9.00| %| 8.99| %| 10.03| %| 9.40| %  \nTotal Return on Purchased Loans (2)| 8.84| %| N/A| 8.84| %| 9.04| %| N/A| 9.04| %  \nTotal loans as of period end:  \nUnpaid principal balance| $| 2,644,390| $| 1,011,374| $| 3,655,764| $| 1,693,627| $| 958,232| $| 2,651,859  \nNet investment basis| 2,420,883| 1,011,374| 3,432,257| 1,516,379| 958,232| 2,474,611  \n  \n(1) Initial net investment basis on purchased loans is the initial amortized cost basis net of initial allowance for credit losses (credit mark).(2) The total return on purchased loans represents scheduled accretion, accelerated accretion, gains (losses) on real estate owned, release of allowance for credit losses on purchased loans, and other noninterest income recorded during the period divided by the average invested balance on an annualized basis. The total return on purchased loans does not include the effect of purchased loan charge-offs or recoveries during the period. Total return on purchased loans is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. See reconciliation in below table entitled “Total Return on Purchased Loans.”\n\n2. Deposits increased by $785.5 million, or 33.6%, from June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in time deposits of $785.4 million, or 60.1%. The significant drivers in the change in time deposits were the increase in brokered time deposits, which increased by $712.6 million, and Community Banking Division time deposits, which increased by $52.9 million compared to June 30, 2024.\n\n3. Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances decreased by $6.1 million, or 1.8%, from June 30, 2024. The decrease was attributable to net paydowns on amortizing advances.\n\n4. Shareholders’ equity increased by $15.9 million, or 4.2%, from June 30, 2024, primarily due to net income of $17.1 million and stock-based compensation of $1.8 million, partially offset by the cancelation of restricted stock to cover tax obligations on restricted stock vests, which had a $3.2 million impact on shareholders’ equity.\n\nNet income increased by $1.9 million to $17.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $15.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n1. Net interest and dividend income before provision for credit losses increased by $1.9 million to $39.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $37.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the following:\n\n  * An increase in interest income earned on loans of $6.2 million, primarily due to higher average balances in the National Lending Division purchased and Small Business Administration (“SBA”) portfolios and higher rates earned on the SBA portfolio;\n  * An increase in interest income earned on short-term investments of $821 thousand, due to higher average balances and higher rates earned; and\n  * A decrease in FHLB borrowings interest expense of $2.1 million, primarily due to lower average balances; partially offset by,\n  * An increase in deposit interest expense of $7.3 million, primarily due to higher average balances as well as higher rates in interest-bearing deposits.\n\n\n\nThe following table summarizes interest income and related yields recognized on the loan portfolios:\n\nInterest Income and Yield on Loans  \n---  \nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n2024| 2023  \nAverage| Interest| Average| Interest  \nBalance (1)| Income| Yield| Balance (1)| Income| Yield  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nCommunity Banking| $| 22,409| $| 370| 6.55| %| $| 27,149| $| 438| 6.42| %  \nSBA National| 59,745| 2,419| 16.06| %| 26,257| 786| 11.91| %  \nNational Lending:  \nOriginated| 997,397| 23,408| 9.31| %| 960,629| 24,219| 10.03| %  \nPurchased| 1,758,801| 39,141| 8.83| %| 1,489,394| 33,671| 8.99| %  \nTotal National Lending| 2,756,198| 62,549| 9.00| %| 2,450,023| 57,890| 9.40| %  \nTotal| $| 2,838,352| $| 65,338| 9.13| %| $| 2,503,429| 59,114| 9.39| %  \n  \n(1) Includes loans held for sale.\n\nThe components of total income on purchased loans are set forth in the table below entitled “Total Return on Purchased Loans.” When compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, transactional income decreased by $776 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and regularly scheduled interest and accretion increased by $6.1 million primarily due to the increase in average balances. The total return on purchased loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 8.8%, a decrease from 9.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The following table details the total return on purchased loans:\n\nTotal Return on Purchased Loans  \n---  \nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n2024| 2023  \nIncome| Return (1)| Income| Return (1)  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nRegularly scheduled interest and accretion| $| 37,160| 8.38| %| $| 31,030| 8.29| %  \nTransactional income:  \nRelease of allowance for credit losses on purchased loans| 64| 0.01| %| 180| 0.05| %  \nAccelerated accretion and loan fees| 1,981| 0.45| %| 2,641| 0.70| %  \nTotal transactional income| 2,045| 0.46| %| 2,821| 0.75| %  \nTotal| $| 39,205| 8.84| %| $| 33,851| 9.04| %  \n  \n(1) The total return on purchased loans represents scheduled accretion, accelerated accretion, and gains (losses) on real estate owned, and release of allowance for credit losses on purchased loans recorded during the period divided by the average invested balance on an annualized basis. The total return does not include the effect of purchased loan charge-offs or recoveries in the quarter. Total return is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\n2. Provision for credit losses increased by $232 thousand to $422 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $190 thousand in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to the increase in originated loans during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n3. Noninterest income increased by $3.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in gain on sale of SBA loans of $3.1 million, due to the sale of $63.1 million in SBA loans during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the sale of $5.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n4. Noninterest expense increased by $2.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the following:\n\n  * An increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $1.5 million, primarily due to increases in regular and stock compensation expense; and\n  * An increase in loan expense of $643 thousand primarily related to increased expenses in connection with the origination of SBA 7(a) loans.\n\n\n\n5. Income tax expense increased by $754 thousand to $7.9 million, or an effective tax rate of 31.6%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $7.2 million, or an effective tax rate of 32.0%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due a $243 thousand increase in tax benefit on the vest of restricted stock and exercise of stock options during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets totaled $37.2 million, or 0.94% of total assets, compared to $28.3 million, or 0.90% of total assets, as of June 30, 2024. The increase is primarily related to four National Lending loans placed on non-accrual, which are individually evaluated in the allowance for credit losses and are well-collateralized.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, past due loans totaled $31.3 million, or 0.89% of total loans, compared to past due loans totaling $26.3 million, or 0.95% of total loans, as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 12.1%, compared to 12.3% at June 30, 2024, and the Total risk-based capital ratio was 12.7% at September 30, 2024, compared to 14.8% at June 30, 2024. The Total risk-based capital ratio decreased primarily due to the increase in risk-weighted assets from significant loan growth during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**_Investor Call Information_** Rick Wayne, Chief Executive Officer, Richard Cohen, Chief Financial Officer, and Pat Dignan, Chief Operating Officer of Northeast Bank, will host a **conference call to discuss first quarter earnings and business outlook at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 30****th****.** To access the conference call by phone, please go to this link ([Phone Registration](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=62K5FCP5-qLrVXR3PChEI9W3AvXTFjC1Ep-fU5zMCHfzFXTYF6HnJY-lw2JS3OBxbME4nn7gcvi_87U7hwn9yedHr7L72qHmggf3cvdxo_ePa7M9k5_M3Ef2eZXBv52_q86qSADEw0FQPy_Ct697LNQBa1jBm0oiKY2zCDHXFA0=)), and you will be provided with dial in details.
