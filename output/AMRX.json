Injectable GLP-1 Agonist\n\nNovember 21, 2024\n\n_Potential first and only DHE autoinjector for tough-to-treat migraines and cluster headaches_\n\n_Exenatide approval highlights Amneal’s capabilities in developing GLP-1 injectables_\n\nBRIDGEWATER, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMRX) (“Amneal” or the “Company”), a global pharmaceutical company, today announced the advancement of two key strategic initiatives. First, the Company has resubmitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) its new drug application (NDA) for dihydroergotamine (DHE) prefilled syringe autoinjector for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura and cluster headache in adults. Second, Amneal has received approval from the FDA for exenatide, which is the Company’s first generic injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist and reflects its innovation capabilities in peptide development and drug-device combinations. \n\n**Resubmission of DHE Autoinjector New Drug Application** This first and only DHE autoinjector has the potential to provide patients with lasting pain relief from tough-to-treat headaches, particularly cluster headaches, with the same powerful medication used in hospitals. The single-dose, ready-to-use autoinjector will not require refrigeration, assembly, or priming, and allow patients to conveniently self-administer at home when experiencing painful attacks. \n\nThe U.S. FDA previously issued a complete response letter to the original NDA, citing facility inspection issues at a third-party site. As a result, Amneal transferred production to in-house and leveraged its expertise in complex injectable manufacturing and engineering to complete development of this new product. The review of this NDA is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025. \n\n“We are excited to be one step closer to providing a new ready-to-use solution for patients suffering from severe migraines and cluster headaches. This is a unique product that can allow patients to self-administer DHE, which is a proven therapy that provides lasting relief for tough-to-treat headaches, in a single-dose autoinjector without the need for assembly or traveling to the emergency room during these painful episodes,” said Joe Renda, Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer - Specialty. \n\nDHE is commonly administered in emergency rooms, urgent care facilities, and headache clinics intravenously. Currently, DHE is also available both as ampules for injection or as a nasal spray formulation for at-home use. Over 39 million Americans are living with migraines (1) , and up to one million with cluster headaches. (2) Also, headache is the fourth most common reason for emergency department visits, and accounts for 3% of all ER visits in the United States. (3)\n\n**U.S. FDA Approval of Exenatide, an Injectable GLP-1 Agonist** The approval of exenatide 1.2 mL and 2.4 mL prefilled pen injection, referencing BYETTA ® , reflects the Company’s deep innovation and regulatory capabilities in complex pharmaceuticals and its ability to successfully develop this first synthetic generic peptide. Exenatide is a GLP-1 agonist indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \n\n“This approval marks one of the first generic GLP-1 injectables to be approved in the U.S. Exenatide is a peptide drug-device combination product that is complex to develop and make. Amneal is leveraging its leading product development and manufacturing capabilities in the rapidly growing GLP-1 therapeutic category,” said Andy Boyer, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer - Generics. \n\nPatients have experienced changes in kidney function, low blood sugar, and inflammation of the pancreas while using exenatide. The most common side effects include nausea, low blood sugar, vomiting, diarrhea, feeling jittery, dizziness, headache, indigestion, constipation, and weakness. \n\nFor complete prescribing information, please refer to the package insert available [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocuments.amneal.com%2Fpi%2FExenatide.pdf&esheet=54156544&newsitemid=20241121053036&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=1&md5=119d79cbf5046d6f1f09fa69cb2118c2). \n\n**About Amneal** Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

          "content": "Q3 2024\nEarnings Call\nNovember 8, 2024\nCautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein, regarding matters that are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements (as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding\nmanagement’s intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations, financial results, or forecasts for the future, including among other things: discussions of future operations; expected or estimated operating results and financial performance; and statements regarding\nour positioning, including our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth, and other non-historical statements. Words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and similar words, or the negatives thereof, are intended to identify estimates\nand forward-looking statements. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events, including with respect to future market conditions, company\nperformance and financial results, operational investments, business prospects, new strategies and growth initiatives, the competitive environment, and other events. If the underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties\nmaterialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of the Company. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully develop, license, acquire and commercialize new products on a\ntimely basis; the competition we face in the pharmaceutical industry from brand and generic drug product companies, and the impact of that competition on our ability to set prices; our ability to obtain exclusive marketing rights for our products; our\nrevenues are derived from the sales of a limited number of products, a substantial portion of which are through a limited number of customers; the impact of a prolonged business interruption within our supply chain; the continuing trend of consolidation of\ncertain customer groups; our dependence on third-party suppliers and distributors for raw materials for our products and certain finished goods; our dependence on third-party agreements for a portion of our product offerings; legal, regulatory and legislative\nefforts by our brand competitors to deter competition from our generic alternatives; our dependence on information technology systems and infrastructure and the potential for cybersecurity incidents; our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled\npersonnel; risks related to federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products; our reliance on certain licenses to proprietary technologies from time to time; the significant amount of resources we expend on research\nand development; the risk of claims brought against us by third parties; risks related to changes in the regulatory environment, including U.S. federal and state laws related to healthcare fraud abuse and health information privacy and security and changes in\nsuch laws; changes to Food and Drug Administration product approval requirements; the impact of healthcare reform and changes in coverage and reimbursement levels by governmental authorities and other third-party payers; our dependence on third-\nparty agreements for a portion of our product offerings; our substantial amount of indebtedness and our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness in the future, and the impact of interest rate fluctuations on such indebtedness; our\npotential expansion into additional international markets subjecting us to increased regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties, including recent events affecting the financial services industry; our ability to identify, make and integrate acquisitions\nor investments in complementary businesses and products on advantageous terms; the impact of global economic, political or other catastrophic events; our obligations under a tax receivable agreement may be significant; and the high concentration of\nownership of our Class A common stock and the fact that we are controlled by the Amneal Group. The forward-looking statements contained herein are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in the\nCompany’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Investors are cautioned not to place\nundue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Forward-looking statements included herein speak only as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to revise or update such statements to\nreflect the occurrence of events or circumstances after the date hereof.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, which are intended as supplemental measures of the Company’s performance that are not required by or\npresented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted diluted EPS reflects diluted earnings per share based on adjusted net income (loss), which is net income (loss) adjusted to (A) exclude (i) non-cash interest, (ii) GAAP provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii)\namortization, (iv) stock-based compensation expense, (v) acquisition, site closure expenses, and idle facility expenses, (vi) restructuring and other charges, (vii) (credit) charges related to certain legal matters, including interest, net, (viii) asset impairment\ncharges, (ix) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (x) increase in tax receivable agreement liability, (xi) system implementation expense, (xii) other and (xiii) net income attributable to non-controlling interests not associated with our Class B common\nstock, and (B) include non-GAAP provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was calculated using the weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding of Class A common stock. Non-\nGAAP adjusted diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was calculated using the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of Class A common stock and assuming all shares of Class B common stock were converted to shares\nof Class A common stock as of January 1, 2023. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company’s operations and to better understand its business because they facilitate a comparative assessment of the\nCompany’s operating performance relative to its performance based on results calculated under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures also isolate the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance and\neliminate certain charges that management believes do not reflect the Company’s operations and underlying operational performance. The compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors also uses certain of these measures to evaluate\nmanagement’s performance and set its compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures also provide useful information to investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and\noperating results facilitates an evaluation of the financial performance of the Company and its operations on a consistent basis. Providing this information therefore allows investors to make independent assessments of the Company’s financial performance,\nresults of operations and trends while viewing the information through the eyes of management. These non-GAAP measures are subject to limitations. The non-GAAP measures presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used\nby other companies because other companies may not calculate one or more in the same manner. Additionally, the non-GAAP performance measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s\nfinancial statements; do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and do not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt. Further, our historical adjusted results are not\nintended to project our adjusted results of operations or financial position for any future period. To compensate for these limitations, management presents and considers these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP results; no non-\nGAAP measure should be considered in isolation from or as alternatives to any measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Readers should review the reconciliations included below, and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the\nCompany’s business. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is set forth herein.\n2\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call\nAgenda\nStrategy & Business Update\n1\nChirag and Chintu Patel,\nCo-founders and Co-CEOs\nChirag Patel, Chintu Patel, Tasos Konidaris,\nCo-CEO and President Co-CEO EVP & CFO\nFinancial Results\n2\nTasos Konidaris, EVP & CFO\n3\nQ&A\nAndy Boyer, Joe Renda, Jason Daly, SVP\nEVP - Generics SVP - Specialty & Chief Legal Officer\n3\nQ3 2024 key highlights\n• Q3 net revenue of $702M, up 13%, and adjusted EBITDA of $158M, up 2%\nStrong\n(or ~15% excluding bXolair R&D milestone payments)\nThird Quarter\n• Continued broad-based revenue growth across all three business segments with\nResults\nGenerics +9%, Specialty +19% and AvKARE +21%\nSolidifying • Promising launch of CREXONT® with patient and provider enthusiasm\nLong Term • Collaboration with Metsera for developing next-generation obesity therapies\nGrowth Profile\n• Addition of biosimilar for XOLAIR® expands biosimilar portfolio\nContinued • Reduced net leverage to 4.2x in Q3, down from 4.8x in December 2023\nDeleveraging • $127M gross debt paydown this year through Q3 year-to-date\n4\nExecuting on Amneal’s four pillars of value creation\nLTM Q3\nKey Pillar Metric 2019 2023 Growth projection(3)\n2024\nIncreased OSD(1) Gx % of\n#1 53% 25% 24% <20% of revenue by 2027\ndiversification total revenue\nRevenues $1.6B $2.4B $2.7B High single-digit growth\nStrong financial\n#2\nperformance\nAdjusted EBITDA $339M $558M $614M Meaningful acceleration\nSustained higher levels\n#3 Cash generation Operating Cash Flow(2) $2M $346M $313M\nof cash flow generation\n< 4x in 2025,\n7.4x 4.8x 4.2x\n#4 Deleveraging Net Leverage\nat 12/31/19 at 12/31/23 at 9/30/24 < 3x thereafter\nNote: LTM = Last Twelve Months\n(1) OSD = Oral Solid.
