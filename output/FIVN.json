This paradox highlights the need for businesses to strike a balance between AI-powered solutions and the human touch to meet the evolving expectations of this tech-savvy generation. \n\nThis desire for efficiency and ease extends beyond just the technology itself. For Gen Z consumers, a seamless and positive customer service experience is essential to building brand loyalty. “The worse my customer service experience is, the less likely I am to use the brand again,” says Mimi Allen, 21. “I shop online because it makes my life easier. I don’t have the time to go into a store to purchase, but if buying stuff online is going to take hours or be difficult, then I won’t use them anymore.” \n\nFive9 conducted a survey of 1,000 Gen Z consumers and tracked customer experience interactions for a select group of these young shoppers. The study found that Gen Z is particularly open to AI for quicker resolutions, with 46% considering it ideal for simple fixes and 47% for generic questions. While nearly 60% of Gen Z appreciate AI's faster response times over human interactions (40%) and its unmatched convenience (19%), 15% said they enjoy the personalized experience it can offer. Surprisingly, when interacting with brands, less than 40% of Gen Z respondents could not distinguish between AI and human interactions in chatbots, text, or email. This data underscores AI’s growing role in streamlining customer service for a generation that expects quick, efficient solutions. \n\n\"Gen Z are natural 'prompt engineers',\" says **Niki Hall , Chief Marketing Officer, Five9**. \"They know how to interact with AI to get the information they need, but they're also keenly aware of its limitations. When it comes to complex issues or sensitive information, they still crave the empathy and problem-solving abilities of a human customer service representative. AI presents a powerful opportunity for brands to enhance customer service, but strategic implementation is key to achieving maximum impact and ROI.\" \n\nDespite their desire for AI-driven customer experiences, nearly 65% of Gen Z consumers still prioritize human customer service for complex issues, finding AI-powered solutions not as trustworthy (47%) and reliable (36%). Human support is preferred for specific scenarios, such as billing (86%), high-value purchases (88%), and returns (77%), emphasizing the importance of empathy and problem-solving in these areas. \n\nSephora, Target, Nordstrom, and Apple are all winning over Gen Z with their top-notch customer service. But it's not just the retail world that's getting it right, as airlines like United, Singapore Airlines, and Delta are also flying high in the eyes of Gen Z travelers. \n\nFor Gen Z shoppers, building a relationship with a brand is key to unlocking exceptional customer experiences. “Loyalty is a two-way street. I can’t expect a brand to drop everything to try and solve my $12.99 order issue,” says Sash Shaban, 23. “However, if I am a regular and we start to build a relationship, that is when I expect an incredible CX experience compared to my purchasing history.” \n\nFive9’s research provides valuable insights for businesses navigating the evolving landscape of customer service in the digital age. By understanding the preferences and expectations of Gen Z regarding AI in customer service, brands can create more effective and trustworthy experiences that foster loyalty and satisfaction. \n\n**Methodology**\n\nThis study was conducted online among a nationally representative sample of 1,000 Gen Z consumers, including 50% ages 18-22 and 50% ages 23-27, in the U.S. between October 23-25, 2024. \n\n**About Five9**\n\nThe Five9 Intelligent CX Platform, powered by Five9 Genius AI, provides a comprehensive suite of solutions to power AI-elevated customer experiences that deliver better business outcomes and Bring Joy to CX™.

Hosted by the Business Intelligence Group, this award celebrates companies, products, and leaders making a significant impact by reshaping their industries and setting new standards for success. \n\n“We are deeply honored to be recognized for our GenAI Studio offering, a reflection of our team's unwavering commitment to redefining the New CX—where automation and human connection seamlessly intersect,” said Niki Hall, CMO of Five9. “This award inspires us to continue driving innovation and delivering on our promise to transform customer experience (CX) for the future, especially at a time when the demand for AI-powered solutions is at an all-time high.” \n\nCompanies today are eager to implement Generative AI within their contact centers, to inform and improve customer and agent experiences. However, many face challenges at implementation, as most readily available solutions only come with pre-defined models and prompts that do not align with their specific needs. Launched in March of this year, GenAI Studio allows organizations to take general purpose, off-the-shelf Generative AI models and customize them for the specifications of their contact center. \n\n“For thirteen years, the BIG Awards for Business spotlight those whose innovative spirit, commitment to progress, and resilience are not only advancing their fields but inspiring a global movement,” said Russ Fordyce, CEO of the Business Intelligence Group. “Congratulations to Five9 for driving forward the future of AI in the contact center through industry-first solutions such as GenAI Studio.” \n\nTo learn more about this award recognition, or GenAI Studio, see here: [https://www.five9.com/products/capabilities/gen-ai-studio](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.five9.com%2Fproducts%2Fcapabilities%2Fgen-ai-studio&esheet=54155813&newsitemid=20241120449461&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.five9.com%2Fproducts%2Fcapabilities%2Fgen-ai-studio&index=2&md5=369b3da326974dea0db9366329f54a35). \n\n**About Five9**\n\nThe Five9 Intelligent CX Platform, powered by Five9 Genius AI, provides a comprehensive suite of solutions to power AI-elevated customer experiences that deliver better business outcomes and Bring Joy to CX™.

The organization’s proprietary and unique scoring system selectively measures performance across multiple business domains and then rewards those companies whose achievements stand above those of their peers. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241120449461r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241120449461/en/>\n\nHannah Blackington Corporate Communications Director, Five9 Press@five9.com\n\nMaria Jimenez Chief Nominations Officer Business Intelligence Group +1 909-529-2737 jmaria@bintelligence.com\n\nSource: Five9\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.five9.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ffive9s-genai-studio-named-best-new-product-2024-industry&t=Five9, Inc. - Five9’s GenAI Studio Named as a Best New Product of 2024 for Industry Excellence \"Facebook\")\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.five9.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ffive9s-genai-studio-named-best-new-product-2024-industry&title=Five9, Inc. - Five9’s GenAI Studio Named as a Best New Product of 2024 for Industry Excellence \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Currently%20reading%20https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.five9.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ffive9s-genai-studio-named-best-new-product-2024-industry \"Twitter\")\n  * [RSS](/rss-news-feeds)\n\n\n\n[Home](https://www.five9.com/) / [About Us](https://www.five9.com/about) / [Investors](/)/\n\nLet's Connect\n\n  * [1-800-553-8159](tel:+1-800-553-8159)\n  * [Get a Quote](https://www.five9.com/products/pricing)\n  * [Get Support](https://www.five9.com/about/contact)\n  * info@five9.com\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n  * [About Us](https://www.five9.com/about)\n  * [Leadership](https://www.five9.com/about/executives)\n  * [News](https://www.five9.com/news)\n  * [Contact](https://www.five9.com/about/contact)\n  * [Resources](https://www.five9.com/resources)\n  * [Trust Office](https://www.five9.com/trust)\n  * [German Site Impressum](https://www.five9.com/legal/impressum)\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n  * [Contact Center Software](https://www.five9.com/products/capabilities/contact-center-software)\n  * [Inbound](https://www.five9.com/products/inbound-contact-center)\n  * [Outbound](https://www.five9.com/products/outbound-contact-center)\n  * [Blended](https://www.five9.com/products/blended-contact-center)\n  * [Pricing](https://www.five9.com/products/pricing)\n  * [TCPA](https://www.five9.com/products/tcpa)\n  * [Omnichannel](https://www.five9.com/products/capabilities/digital-engagement)\n  * [Why Cloud](https://www.five9.com/cloudmigration)\n  * [Predictive Dialer](https://www.five9.com/products-solutions)\n  * [WFO](https://www.five9.com/products/capabilities/workforce-optimization)\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n  * [Events](https://www.five9.com/about/events)\n  * [Webinars](https://www.five9.com/resources#webinars)\n\n\n\nJoin\n\n  * [Careers](https://www.five9.com/about/careers)\n  * [Partners](https://www.five9.com/partners)\n  * [Referral Program](https://www.five9.com/partners/referral-program)\n  * [Development](https://www.five9.com/development)\n\n\n\n[Legal](https://www.five9.com/legal) | [Terms of Use](https://www.five9.com/legal/termsofuse) | [Privacy Policy](https://www.five9.com/legal/privacypolicy) | [Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.five9.com/trust/vdp) | [Trust](https://www.five9.com/trust) | [Contact](https://www.five9.com/about/contact)\n\n4000 Executive Parkway, Suite 400, San Ramon, CA 94583, USA 1-800-553-8159 | info@five9.com\n\n© 2024 Five9, Inc.
