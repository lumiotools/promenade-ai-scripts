(NASDAQ: RENB)** , a pioneer in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics powered by artificial intelligence, today issued a letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer David Weinstein.\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nIt is my honor to address you as the newly appointed CEO of Renovaro Inc. After careful consideration, I left a 40-year career on Wall Street to join Renovaro because I believe the Company has tremendous potential in its verticals, such as the dendritic cancer cell vaccine (DCCV) and AI powered multi-cancer early detection screening and therapeutics. It has been a busy two weeks since I arrived, managing to file our 10-K and 10-K/A on time and retain MZ Group for investor relationships and have had dismissed the derivative class action lawsuit. Now, our principal focus is conducting a comprehensive analysis of both businesses and developing a 100-day plan of action to commercialize our existing assets as soon as feasible. This includes an evaluation of previously announced MOUs and then determining how to advance these relationships. Additionally, we recognize the company’s strengths and are identifying areas where we can focus on business development. One key focus area is the cross pollination for both verticals. RenovaroCube can generate useful biomarkers analysis that could be used in trial design and cohort stratification for the DCCV clinical trials.\n\nThe future of multi-cancer early detection screening and recurrence testing reached an inflection point four years ago when the Nvidia-powered AI chips were introduced. RenovaroCube, Freenome, and other new entrants have the potential to set the standard because they are processing vast data sets with multiple biomarkers. Our moonshot is to achieve a test accuracy over 95% and, ultimately, to provide patients with rapid results from a simple blood draw taken when they have their physical exam. We are excited about the Company’s prospects and believe that over the next five years we will be part of the paradigm shift within the industry. Maurice van Tilberg, the Chairman of the Board (Director of the Dutch National Growth fund and former CEO of Euronext Amsterdam), remarked, “I am excited to be working with our CEO, David Weinstein. Together we are building a corporate culture that will support deliverables and timely execution upon solidifying our 100-day plan. This plan will prioritize commercializing our technologies.”\n\nWhile chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has been successful in treating hematologic cancers, it has limited efficacy against solid tumors. While our Dendritic Cell Cancer Vaccine (DCCV) is still preclinical, it has the potential to treat solid tumors as a class. Preliminary preclinical in vitro data and the proof-of-concept data from the in vivo studies have been compelling, with near complete elimination of pancreatic tumors in three weeks.\n\nSuffice it to say that both potential solutions represent billion-dollar opportunities. Yet, there remains much to be done to right the ship so we can extrapolate value from both verticals. Our goal is to advance from science to business. To accomplish this, I brought on an entirely new Board of Directors. They have both Wall Street experience and deep knowledge of biotechnology, AI, corporate governance, and public company finance.\n\nThrough the upcoming months, I will keep you informed and engaged in this journey. I am committed to solidifying our team and building the future. We are establishing proper corporate governance and transparency, which is important for all stakeholders. \n\nYou will hear from me in the next quarter about the progress would have made to that date. I am grateful for shareholders that have stayed with the company and will work hard to reward that loyalty.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid WeinsteinCEORenovaro Inc.\n\n**About Renovaro**\n\nRenovaro [https://renovarogroup.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R1gDw6ot0W8DzjnG6tJ9gGL1mOr3dat0IQVOQgclp7LbfMfS4mZkKH2JTqQ1CHtq68XS4Mz5pSFKGY3kpifIwjjL4mbmdyThP9EEbZ9OmZlne1mG-Zrl6mUtDmxKlz-OHRzuLw0ZvCOUUjbxiCu4vMHEN4GuPJo8vxjNK9nzsE5RIhwugz10VIgtvYLWBYjxU0QJRB_m3EkIZ7Fh9_g-c4XF66c1EvU-wpD7xp8QtqOa5s9FCx5LIyFjxylCNzuzHzy93Fp1WAWc-wRzPedDjw==) aims to accelerate precision and personalized medicine for longevity powered by mutually reinforcing AI and biotechnology platforms for early diagnosis, better-targeted treatments, and drug discovery.

This is where our AI-enabled early diagnostics, oncology vaccine and upcoming\ntest and potential treatment replacement for chemotherapy come into play. Approximately\nhalf of cancers are diagnosed late at Stage 3 and Stage 4, and only then with painful,\ntime consuming and expensive diagnostics methods such as tissue biopsy and multiple\nimaging techniques.\n• 60% of cancers are not effectively treated resulting in the use of expensive and toxic\nchemotherapy which only allows the cancer to spread while damaging the immune\nTHE CHALLENGE\nsystem and health of the patient, often resulting in serious illness and, ultimately, death or\na shorten lifespan.\nTHE OPPORTUNITY\nOpportunities\nAI-powered early diagnosis of cancers has the potential to increase patient quality of life\nwhile reducing premature death and the economic burden to healthcare systems.\nPotential\nEarly diagnosis of cancer can result in a $200B market opportunity.*\nSource\n* https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/cancer-diagnostics\nCONFIDENTIAL\nMULTIPLIER EFFECT DRIVES BUSINESS\nOPPORTUNTIES\nExplainable AI Engine\nDiagnostics\nAI system agnostic, trusted and versatile.\nExplainable Capable of handling data from multiple sources.\nAI Engine\nDiagnostics\nPrecision Early diagnosis, recurrence and response to treatment.\nMedicine Can be applied to liquid biopsies.\nTherapeutics\nTherapeutics\nA universal off the shelf approach for various indications.\nAllowing non-toxic universal treatment.\nCONFIDENTIAL\nTHE CLINICAL IMPACT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR\n• While cancer treatment has improved significantly in past\nyears, the overall improvement in patient QoL has only\nseen linear improvements.\n• Since 1975-today, therapy advances have added ~1.5\nyears of life per decade and average lifespan of cancer\npatients has increased by ~5.5 years.\n• Over half of this advance is courtesy of technologies that\nenable diagnosing cancer early. This has led to life\nexpectancy outcomes that otherwise wouldn’t have\noccurred until 2035.\n• Liquid biopsy-based diagnostics can accelerate the life\nexpectancy tremendously at a fraction of the costs of\nnew therapeutic advances.\nSource\n• https://prevention.cancer.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/Liquid-Bx-Day2-07-Canzi.pptx\n• https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/cancer-diagnostics\n• https://seer.cancer.gov/statistics-\nnetwork/explorer/application.html?site=1&data_type=1&graph_type=2&compareBy=sex&chk_sex_3=3&chk_sex_2=2&rate_type=2&race=1&age_range=1&hdn_stage=101&advopt_precision=1&advopt_show_ci=on&hdn_view=0&advopt_show_ap\nc=on&advopt_display=2#resultsRegion0\nCONFIDENTIAL\nTHE TIMING IS RIGHT\n• New technology has dramatically\nreduced costs of genetic testing and\nopened new frontiers for molecular\ntesting. The cost of whole genome\nsequencing (WGS) dropped from $2.7\n1\nmillion in 1990 to $300 in 2020.\n2\n• Liquid biopsy in oncology is the biggest\nfrontier for application of WGS based\ndiagnostics.\n• The current ceiling for potential\nreimbursement is sub-$1,000/ liquid\nbiopsy test. Reaching that threshold will\n4\nopen up a €150B market.\n3\nThe timing is right for reduction as both WGS costs and also the acceleration of GPU power and\nAI powered super computing allows the data sequenced from WGS to be analysed more deeply • Tremendously active market → 2 serious\nwhich would not have been possible a few years ago.

PROFILE\nAttributes Target\nPatient population Locally (inoperable) advanced to metastatic solid tumors (failed to respond to\nstandard of care)\nP1 safety all solid tumor\nBasket P2a pick 3-4 indications: Pancreas, Liver, Triple Neg breast, Head/Neck,\nMesothelioma.\nRegistrational approach: expanded responding cohort for breakthrough/RMAT\nEfficacy endpoints Overall survival\nClinical response 2 months after last boost\nMechanism of Action Adaptive immune response to genetically-enhanced dendritic cell presenting tumor\nantigen to educate T Cell response (CD4/CD8)\nDosing regiment Up to 6 injections for total of 50M-100M cells\nRoute of delivery Intradermal injection\nContraindications TBD: Low T Cell count\n24\nINITIAL CLINICAL STUDY RENB-DC11-01\nPhase I/IIa – Open to all solid tumors, focus on Patients with Pancreatic Cancer\nPhase I (2025) – Safety assessment: Ascending dose ranging cohort of up to 6\npatients/dose level\nPhase IIa (enrollment starting in late 3Q 2025)– Fixed dose multi-cohort\ndesign (one cohort/cancer type)\n Assumes high response rate\n Up to 20-25 patients/extending cohort into P2b (assuming responding\ntumor type)\nSeek Breakthrough and/or RMAT* designation for accelerated development and\napproval (data to support RMAT available end 2025 / first half of 2026)\n* Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT): accelerated approval pathway for cell and gene\ntherapy qualified product candidates for the Center of Biologics Evaluation and Research of the USA\nFDA.\n25\nRENB-DC11-01 STUDY STRATEGY\n Biotech companies often outsource the full study to a CRO\n There are large costs associated with layers of project management in this\nmodel and risks to meeting regulatory requirements by ceding full control\n Initial estimates based upon prior experience with the full-service CRO\nmodel aggregated to approximately $20 Million for the Phase I/IIa study\n By adopting a model where Renovaro assumes more of the project\nmanagement and parses out responsibility to vendors, focusing on their\nstrengths without their overhead costs…\n Budget reduced by an estimated 50% while maintaining full control and\nfull-service\n26\nNo Offer or Solicitation\nThis report is not intended to and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy
