Our second quarter earnings continue to be\ndirectly impacted by the high-interest rate environment and its impact on funding\ncosts, a challenge that is affecting the entire banking industry. We are implementing\nsteps to grow net income and remain focused on improving our financial\nperformance. Loan balances decreased modestly during the second quarter related\nto our efforts to focus on asset quality and pricing versus growth. Our emphasis is on\nimproving our performance metrics and increasing profitability in each successive\nquarter. While the high-interest rate environment has affected our industry and\ngrowth goals, we remain optimistic about our future performance.\nWe continue to closely monitor asset quality and are diligently working to reduce\nportfolio risk. Nonperforming loans, primarily concentrated in the agriculture\ncategory, declined from the prior quarter while our commercial real estate portfolios\ncontinue to perform well.\nDuring the second quarter, we were honored to once again be named to American\nBanker Magazine’s Top 100 Publicly Traded Community Banks list.
