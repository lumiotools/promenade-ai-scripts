          "content": "Third Quarter\nEarnings\nNovember 6, 2024\nBUILT TO CONNECT\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements contained in this presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements relate to, among other things, income, earnings, cash flows,\nchanges in operations, operating improvements, businesses in which we operate and the United States and global economies. Statements in the presentation that are not\nhistorical are hereby identified as “forward-looking statements” and may be indicated by words or phrases such as “anticipates”, “supports”, “plans”, “projects”, “expects”,\n“believes”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “hope”, “forecast”, “management is of the opinion”, use of the future tense and similar words or phrases. These forward-looking\nstatements are based largely on management’s expectations, which are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed and\ndescribed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks described in Part I, Item 1A thereof, and in other reports subsequently filed by us with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, which may cause actual results, financial or otherwise, to be materially different from those anticipated, expressed or implied by the\nforward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no\nobligation to update any such forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company’s results, the Company refers to various GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples) and non-GAAP financial measures which management believes provide useful information to investors. These non-GAAP measures have no standardized\nmeaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management of the Company\ndoes not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Nonetheless, this non-GAAP information can be useful in\nunderstanding the Company’s operating results and the performance of its core business. Management of the Company uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to establish internal budgets and targets and to evaluate the Company’s financial performance against such budgets and targets. A reconciliation of these\nnon-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the appendix.\n2\nThird Quarter Highlights\nJACO VAN DER MERWE\nCEO AND PRESIDENT\n3\nWelcoming\nBrian Harris,\n• Brian previously served for 10 years as Executive Vice President\nAstec’s New CFO\nand Chief Financial Officer of Summit Materials, Inc.

Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nAstec Industries, Inc. (\"Astec\" or the \"Company\") is a Tennessee corporation which was incorporated in 1972. The Company designs, engineers, manufactures,\nmarkets and services equipment and components used primarily in asphalt and concrete road building and related construction activities, as well as other\nproducts discussed below. The Company's products are used in each phase of road building, from quarrying and crushing the aggregate to application of the\nroad surface. The Company's product portfolio includes both asphalt and concrete equipment. The Company also manufactures certain equipment and\ncomponents unrelated to road construction, including equipment for the mining, quarrying, construction, demolition, land clearing and recycling industries and\nport and rail yard operators; industrial heat transfer equipment; commercial whole-tree pulpwood chippers; horizontal grinders; blower trucks; concrete plants;\ncommercial and industrial burners; and combustion control systems.\nThe Company operates in two reportable segments (plus Corporate and Other) - Infrastructure Solutions and Materials Solutions. The Company's two reportable\nbusiness segments comprise sites based upon the nature of the products or services produced, the type of customer for the products, the similarity of economic\ncharacteristics, the manner in which management reviews results and the nature of the production process, among other considerations.\nThe Corporate and Other category consists primarily of the parent company and Astec Insurance Company (\"Astec Insurance\" or the \"captive\"), a captive\ninsurance company, which do not meet the requirements for separate disclosure as an operating segment or inclusion in one of the reporting segments.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Astec and its subsidiaries and have been prepared by the Company,\npursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated\nfinancial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the SEC rules and regulations governing interim\nfinancial statements. However, the Company believes that the disclosures made in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes are\nadequate to make the information presented not misleading. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. All\nintercompany balances and transactions between the Company and its affiliates have been eliminated in consolidation.\nNoncontrolling interest in the Company's consolidated financial statements represents the 7% interest in a consolidated subsidiary which is not owned by the\nCompany. Since the Company controls this subsidiary, the subsidiary's financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company, and the noncontrolling\nowner's 7% share of the subsidiary's net assets and results of operations is deducted and reported as \"Noncontrolling interest\" in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets and as \"Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company executed an agreement in\nFebruary 2022 with the noncontrolling interest holder to acquire their outstanding interest in full for R$10.0M (approximately $2.0 million, subject to the effect of\nexchange rates). Completion of the transaction is subject to resolution of certain disputes between the parties.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include\ninventory net realizable value, product warranty obligations, self-insurance loss reserves, capitalization of internal use software, goodwill and other intangible\nassets impairment and the measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions,\njudgments and estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIn the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations and\ncomprehensive (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial position as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and, except as otherwise discussed herein, such adjustments\nconsist only of those of a normal recurring nature. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in a full reporting year.\nAll dollar amounts, except share and per share amounts, are in millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n8\nINDEX\nAdjustments\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company identified immaterial errors associated with over-accruals of inventory-related expenses in its historical financial\nstatements. The cumulative effect of the errors generated in 2021 and 2022 was corrected during the first quarter of 2023, resulting in a decrease in \"Cost of\nsales\" of $1.9 million.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280):\nImprovement to Reportable Segment Disclosures,\" which requires entities to disclose significant segment expenses, other segment items, the title and position\nof the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") and information related to how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among\ncertain other required disclosures. Additionally, current annual disclosures will be required in interim periods. The new standard is effective, on a retrospective\nbasis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption\npermitted. The Company is currently finalizing the assessment of the impact this ASU will have on its financial statement disclosures, but this standard will not\nimpact the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,\" which requires entities to disclose\nspecific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a specified quantitative threshold. In\naddition, the new standard requires disclosure of the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and by jurisdiction for\nexceeding a specified quantitative threshold. Additionally, income or loss from continuing operations before income tax will be required to be disaggregated\nbetween domestic and foreign classifications and income tax expense will be required to be disaggregated between federal, state and foreign classifications.\nThe new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. The Company\nis currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its financial statement disclosures, but this standard will not impact the Company's results of operations\nor financial position.\nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275, \"The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for\nInvestors,\" which will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. On April 4, 2024, the SEC\nvoluntarily stayed the effective date of the final rule pending judicial review of petitions challenging it, which have been consolidated for review by the U.S.\nDistrict Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. Notwithstanding any changes as a result of these challenges, the disclosure requirements will apply to the\nCompany's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this final rule will have on its financial statement disclosures.\nHowever, the disclosure requirements of this rule and the timing of its effectiveness is uncertain pending the resolution of the judicial review.\nRecent accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable, did not have, or is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.\nNote 2. Inventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value, which requires the Company to make specific estimates, assumptions and\njudgments in determining the amount, if any, of reductions in the valuation of inventories to their net realizable values.\nInventories consist of the following:\n(in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRaw materials and parts $ 284.0 $ 298.6\nWork-in-process 95.9 87.1\nFinished goods 83.8 68.3\nUsed equipment 2.7 1.6\nTotal $ 466.4 $ 455.6\nNote 3. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company has various financial instruments that must be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including marketable debt and equity securities held by\nAstec Insurance and marketable equity securities held in the Company's deferred compensation programs. The Company's deferred compensation programs\n(each, a \"DCP\") include a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (\"SERP\") and a separate non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Although\nthe DCP's investments are allocated to individual participants, and investment decisions are made solely by those participants, they are non-qualified plans.\nConsequently, the Company owns the assets and the related offsetting liability for disbursement until\n9\nINDEX\nsuch time as a participant makes a qualifying withdrawal. The DCP assets and related offsetting liabilities are recorded in non-current \"Investments\" and \"Other\nlong-term liabilities,\" respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's subsidiaries also occasionally enter into foreign currency exchange\ncontracts to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nThe carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, trade receivables and contract assets, other receivables, accounts payable, short-term debt\nand long-term debt approximates their fair value because of their short-term nature and/or interest rates associated with the instruments. Investments are carried\nat their fair value based on quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or, where no quoted prices exist, other observable inputs for the asset. The fair\nvalues of foreign currency exchange contracts are based on quotations from various banks for similar instruments using models with market-based inputs.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are categorized based on the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. The inputs used to\nmeasure the fair value are identified in the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the\nmeasurement date.\nAs indicated in the tables below, the Company has determined that all of its financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are\nLevel 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy defined above:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Total\nFinancial assets:\nTrading equity securities:\nDeferred compensation programs' mutual funds $ 5.2 $ — $ 5.2\nPreferred stocks 0.3 — 0.3\nEquity funds 0.6 — 0.6\nTrading debt securities:\nCorporate bonds 3.2 — 3.2\nAgency bonds — 1.6 1.6\nU.S. government securities 2.5 — 2.5\nAsset-backed securities — 6.8 6.8\nExchange traded funds 1.2 — 1.2\nMortgage backed securities — 0.4 0.4\nOther 0.2 0.3 0.5\nTotal financial assets $ 13.2 $ 9.1 $ 22.3\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeferred compensation programs' liabilities $ — $ 6.2 $ 6.2\nTotal financial liabilities $ — $ 6.2 $ 6.2\n10\nINDEX\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Total\nFinancial assets:\nTrading equity securities:\nDeferred compensation programs' mutual funds $ 4.2 $ — $ 4.2\nPreferred stocks 0.3 — 0.3\nEquity funds 0.7 — 0.7\nTrading debt securities:\nCorporate bonds 3.4 — 3.4\nAgency bonds — 2.5 2.5\nU.S. government securities 1.9 — 1.9\nAsset-backed securities — 4.0 4.0\nExchange traded funds 1.3 — 1.3\nMortgage backed securities — 0.5 0.5\nOther 0.2 0.5 0.7\nTotal financial assets $ 12.0 $ 7.5 $ 19.5\nFinancial liabilities:\nDerivative financial instruments $ — $ 0.1 $ 0.1\nDeferred compensation programs' liabilities — 5.5 5.5\nTotal financial liabilities $ — $ 5.6 $ 5.6\nNote 4. Goodwill\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company identified that indicators of goodwill impairment were present due to current macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding declines in the Company's publicly quoted share price and increased interest rates, as well as lower than expected operating results. These factors\nindicated that one or more of the Company's reporting units may have fallen below their carrying amounts. A qualitative assessment on all reporting units was\nperformed and the Company concluded that a further quantitative analysis was required for the Materials Solutions reporting unit.\nThe Company determined the fair value of the Materials Solutions reporting unit using an equally weighted combination of the discounted cash flow method, a\nform of the income approach, and the guideline public company method, a form of the market approach. The significant assumptions used under the discounted\ncash flow method are projected net sales, projected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), terminal growth rates, and the cost\nof capital. Projected net sales, projected EBITDA and terminal growth rates were determined to be significant assumptions because they are primary drivers of\nthe projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow fair value model. Cost of capital was also determined to be a significant assumption as it is the discount rate\nused to calculate the current fair value of those projected cash flows. The Company calculates the discount rate based on a market-participant, risk-adjusted\nweighted average cost of capital, which considers industry specific rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure, adjusted for\nrisks associated with business size, geography and other factors specific to the reporting unit. A change in the discount rate, as a result of a change in economic\nconditions or otherwise, could result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value. For the guideline public company method, significant\nassumptions relate to the selection of appropriate guideline companies and related valuation multiples used in the market analysis.\nBased on the quantitative impairment test, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Materials Solutions reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of\nJune 30, 2024. As a result, the Company recognized a pretax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $20.2 million in \"Goodwill impairment\" in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations to fully impair the goodwill allocated to the Materials Solutions reporting unit.\nNote 5. Product Warranty Reserves\nThe Company warrants its products against manufacturing defects and performance to specified standards. The warranty period and performance standards\nvary by market and uses of its products, but generally range from three months to two years or up to a specified number of hours of operation. The Company\nestimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranties and\n11\nINDEX\nrecords a liability at the time product sales are recorded. The product warranty liability is primarily based on historical claim rates, nature of claims and the\nassociated cost.\nChanges in the Company's product warranty liability for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nReserve balance, beginning of the period $ 15.4 $ 16.5 $ 16.5 $ 11.9\nWarranty liabilities accrued 4.1 3.8 12.8 14.4\nWarranty liabilities settled (4.4) (3.6) (14.1) (9.6)\nOther 0.1 — — —\nReserve balance, end of the period $ 15.2 $ 16.7 $ 15.2 $ 16.7\nNote 6. Accrued Loss Reserves\nThe Company records reserves for losses related to known workers' compensation and general liability claims that have been incurred but not yet paid or are\nestimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company. The undiscounted reserves are actuarially determined based on the Company's evaluation\nof the type and severity of individual claims and historical information, primarily its own claims experience, along with assumptions about future events. Changes\nin assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause these estimates to change in the future. Total accrued loss reserves were $6.9 million and\n$7.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which $5.1 million and $4.5 million were included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nNote 7. Income Taxes\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $2.3 million, reflecting a 27.1% effective tax rate, compared to\n$0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an 8.5% effective tax rate. The income tax benefit for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 was higher compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher pretax book loss and changes in the relative weighting of jurisdictional income\nand loss.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $0.6 million, reflecting a 3.4% effective tax rate, compared to a\nprovision of $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 25.7% effective tax rate. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to an expense in the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower pretax book income and changes in the relative\nweighting of jurisdictional income and loss, partially offset by a net nondeductible goodwill impairment.\nThe Company's recorded liability for uncertain tax positions was $13.7 million and $13.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe increase is the result of $0.7 million of incremental reserves associated with a research and development credit generated during 2024. The Company does\nnot anticipate a significant change in unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations and federal, state, and foreign tax audit\nresolutions over the next twelve months.\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax reserves. The Company\nis currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the federal income tax return from the 2018 tax year as well as various other state income tax\nand jurisdictional audits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the tax positions it has taken will be sustained upon\nthe resolution of its audits, resulting in no material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. However, the final\ndetermination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from the Company's estimates and/or from its historical\nincome tax provisions and accruals and could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made.\nIn addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties and/or interest assessments.\nNote 8. Commitments and Contingencies\nCertain customers have financed purchases of Company products through arrangements with third-party financing institutions. Under these arrangements, the\nCompany is contingently liable for customer debt of $1.5 million and $1.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These\narrangements expire at various dates through September 2026. Additionally, the Company is also contingently liable for 1.75% of the unpaid balance,\ndetermined as of December 31 of the prior year (or approximately $0.1 million for 2024), on certain past customer equipment purchases that were financed by\nan outside finance company. The agreements provide that the Company will receive the lender's full security interest in the financed\n12\nINDEX\nequipment if the Company is required to fulfill its contingent liability under these arrangements. The Company has recorded a liability of $0.4 million and $0.6\nmillion related to these guarantees, which were included in \"Other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company reviews off-balance sheet guarantees individually and at the loss pool level based on one agreement. Prior history is considered with respect to\nthe Company having to perform on any off-balance sheet guarantees, as well as future projections of individual customer creditworthiness with respect to\nassessing credit losses related to off-balance sheet guarantees.\nIn addition, the Company is contingently liable under letters of credit issued under its $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"), which\noutstanding letters of credit totaled $8.6 million as of September 30, 2024. The outstanding letters of credit expire at various dates through September 2025.\nUnused letters of credit under the Credit Facility are $21.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company is additionally contingently liable for a total of\n$5.8 million in performance letters of credit and retention guarantees primarily held by its foreign subsidiaries, of which $4.0 million are secured by separate\ncredit facilities with various financial institutions as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were $12.9 million of unused letters of credit under\nsuch separate credit facilities.\nThe Company and certain of its former executive officers were previously named as defendants in a putative shareholder class action lawsuit filed in 2019\nalleging that the defendants violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making\nallegedly false and misleading statements. On September 10, 2024, the court formally approved the parties' agreement to settle the action for $13.7 million,\nwhich was funded entirely by the Company's insurance carriers into escrow, and the settlement agreement was entered into between the parties. The court\ndismissed the case with prejudice the same day. In connection with the settlement, management previously recorded a liability of $13.7 million in \"Other current\nliabilities\" and a corresponding $13.7 million receivable from the Company's insurance carriers in \"Trade receivables, contract assets and other receivables, net\"\nduring the first quarter of 2024.\nThe Company's GEFCO, Inc. (\"GEFCO\" or \"Enid\") subsidiary has been named a defendant in a lawsuit originally filed in 2018. The complaint alleged breaches\nof warranty and other similar claims regarding equipment sold by GEFCO in 2013 and also sought special and consequential damages. On October 8, 2024, the\nparties reached an agreement to resolve this action for $8.4 million for which management recorded a loss in \"Restructuring, impairment and other asset\ncharges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and \"Other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the third quarter of 2024.\nOn October 5, 2023, a jury in the 355th Judicial District Court, Hood County, State of Texas, rendered a verdict against the Company's Telsmith, Inc. subsidiary in\nthe matter styled 37 Building Products, Ltd. (\"37 BP\") v. Telsmith, Inc. (\"Telsmith\"), et al. originally filed on January 28, 2019. 37 BP alleged breaches of warranty\nand negligent misrepresentation regarding equipment manufactured by Telsmith and purchased by 37 BP in 2017 through one of the Company's dealers. On\nDecember 19, 2023, a judgment was issued in the amount of $7.9 million (the \"Judgment\") against Telsmith. Based on the jury verdict, management recorded a\nloss contingency of $6.4 million in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and \"Other current liabilities\" in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets during the third quarter of 2023 representing management's best estimate of the loss at that time. During the fourth quarter of\n2023, the loss contingency was increased $1.5 million based on the Judgment to a total of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Telsmith filed a\nMotion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict that the court denied on December 19, 2023. Telsmith filed a Motion for New Trial and Motion for Remittitur in\nJanuary 2024. The court denied Telsmith's motion for a new trial in February 2024. In March 2024, Telsmith filed a notice of appeal with the Texas Court of\nAppeals to appeal the Judgment by the district court. As of June 30, 2024, the total loss contingency recorded inclusive of post-judgment interest was $8.2\nmillion. In September 2024, the parties reached an agreement to resolve this action for $6.3 million, which the Company paid in September 2024 whereby the\nfull loss contingency was released. The $1.9 million net impact of the loss contingency release and the final settlement amount was recorded in \"Selling, general\nand administrative expenses\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter of 2024.\nIn addition to the matters noted above, the Company is currently a party, and may become a party, to various other claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary\ncourse of business. If management believes that a loss arising from any claims and legal proceedings is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the\nCompany records the amount of the loss (excluding estimated legal fees) or, when the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more\nprobable than another, the minimum estimated liability. As management becomes aware of additional information concerning such contingencies, any potential\nliability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. If management believes that a loss arising from such claims and legal\nproceedings is either (i) probable but cannot be reasonably estimated or (ii) reasonably estimable but not probable, the Company does not record the amount of\nthe loss but does make specific disclosure of such matter.\nBased upon currently available information and with the advice of counsel, management believes that the ultimate outcome of its current claims and legal\nproceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nHowever, claims and legal proceedings are subject to inherent\n13\nINDEX\nuncertainties, and rulings unfavorable to the Company could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse effect\non the Company's financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nNote 9.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had contract assets of $3.7 million and contract liabilities,\nexcluding customer deposits, of $5.6 million, including $0.8 million of deferred revenue related to extended warranties.\nNote 10. Segment Information\nThe Company has two reportable segments, each of which comprise sites based upon the nature of the products or services produced, the type of customer for\nthe products, the similarity of economic characteristics, the manner in which management\n15\nINDEX\nreviews results and the nature of the production process, among other considerations. Based on a review of these factors, the Company's Australia and Latin\nAmerica (\"LatAm\") sites and Astec Digital have changed reportable segments beginning January 1, 2024. The Australia and LatAm sites were previously\nreported in the Infrastructure Solutions segment and have moved to the Materials Solutions segment. Astec Digital was previously included in the Corporate and\nOther category and has moved to the Infrastructure Solutions segment.\nSegment Operating Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the Company's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), who is considered to be\nthe CODM, to evaluate performance and allocate resources to the operating segments. Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss\nbefore the impact of interest income or expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments that are not considered by the\nCODM in the evaluation of ongoing operating performance. The Company's presentation of Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to\nsimilar measures used by other companies and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each reportable segment\nbeen an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Beginning January 1, 2024, the Company's presentation of Segment Operating Adjusted\nEBITDA has been modified to exclude the net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest and include intersegment profit.\nPrior periods have been revised to reflect the changes for both the segment composition and the segment profit or loss metric calculation for comparability.\nA brief description of each segment is as follows:\nInfrastructure Solutions – Sites within the Infrastructure Solutions segment design, engineer, manufacture and market a complete line of asphalt plants,\nconcrete plants and their related components and ancillary equipment, including industrial automation controls and telematics platforms, as well as supply\nasphalt road construction equipment, industrial thermal systems and other heavy equipment. The sites based in North America within the Infrastructure Solutions\nsegment are primarily manufacturing operations, while those located outside of North America service and install equipment and provide parts in the regions in\nwhich they operate for many of the products produced by all of the Company's manufacturing sites. The primary purchasers of the products produced by this\nsegment are asphalt and concrete producers, highway and heavy equipment contractors, utility contractors, forestry and environmental recycling contractors and\ndomestic and foreign governmental agencies.\nMaterials Solutions – Sites within the Materials Solutions segment design and manufacture heavy processing equipment, in addition to servicing and supplying\nparts for the aggregate, metallic mining, recycling, ports and bulk handling markets. The sites within the Materials Solutions segment are primarily manufacturing\noperations, with the AME, Australia and LatAm sites functioning to market, service and install equipment and provide parts in the regions in which they operate\nfor many of the products produced by all of the Company's manufacturing sites. Additionally, the Materials Solutions segment offers consulting and engineering\nservices to provide complete \"turnkey\" processing systems. The principal purchasers of aggregate processing equipment include distributors, highway and\nheavy equipment contractors, sand and gravel producers, demolition, recycle and crushing contractors, open mine operators, quarry operators, port and inland\nterminal authorities, power stations and foreign and domestic governmental agencies.\nCorporate and Other – The Corporate and Other category consists primarily of the parent company and the captive which do not meet the requirements for\nseparate disclosure as an operating segment or inclusion in one of the reporting segments. The parent company and the captive provide support and corporate\noversight for other sites.\nSegment Information: The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant\nAccounting Policies. Intersegment sales and transfers between foreign subsidiaries are valued at prices comparable to those for unrelated parties.\nThe Company has revised its presentation for the prior periods below to remove the presentation of Corporate and Other in conjunction with the reportable\nsegment results and reconcile the total of the reportable segments’ revenues from external customers and measure of profit or loss to \"Net sales\" and \"(Loss)\nincome before income taxes\", respectively, whereby Corporate and Other costs, net of eliminations, have been removed from total reportable segments’\nrevenues from external customers and Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA and included in the reconciliations to \"Net sales\" and \"(Loss) income before income\ntaxes\", respectively.\n16\nINDEX\nSegment information for the Company’s reportable segments and related reconciliations are set forth below:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues from external customers\nInfrastructure Solutions $ 165.0 $ 163.2 $ 588.6 $ 578.1\nMaterials Solutions 126.4 139.9 357.5 422.9\nNet sales $ 291.4 $ 303.1 $ 946.1 $ 1,001.0\nIntersegment revenues\nInfrastructure Solutions $ 25.7 $ 11.9 $ 41.4 $ 28.6\nMaterials Solutions 1.4 0.1 2.8 0.8\nIntersegment revenues $ 27.1 $ 12.0 $ 44.2 $ 29.4\nReportable Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA\nInfrastructure Solutions $ 15.6 $ 13.3 $ 68.4 $ 67.5\nMaterials Solutions 14.5 9.5 30.0 42.4\nSegment Operating Adjusted EBITDA - Reportable Segments 30.1 22.8 98.4 109.9\nReconciliation of Reportable Segment Operating Adjusted\nEBITDA to \"(Loss) income before income taxes\"\nCorporate and Other (12.7) (12.8) (34.5) (32.5)\nTransformation program (8.4) (7.7) (25.8) (22.5)\nRestructuring and other related charges (8.4) (0.1) (9.4) (7.6)\nGoodwill impairment — — (20.2) —\nAsset impairment — — — (0.8)\n(Loss) gain on sale of property and equipment, net — (0.4) 1.1 3.1\nInterest expense, net (2.1) (1.9) (6.9) (4.9)\nDepreciation and amortization (7.0) (7.1) (20.1) (19.6)\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest — 0.1 (0.1) 0.2\n(Loss) income before income taxes $ (8.5) $ (7.1) $ (17.5) $ 25.3\nNote 11. Strategic Transformation, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Asset Charges, net\nThe Company's strategic transformation program includes the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of a standardized enterprise resource planning\n(\"ERP\"), which is replacing much of the existing disparate core financial systems. The upgraded ERP will initially convert internal operations, manufacturing,\nfinance, human capital resources management and customer relationship systems to cloud-based platforms. An implementation of this scale is a major financial\nundertaking and requires substantial time and attention of management and key employees.\nIn addition, a lean manufacturing initiative at one of the Company's largest sites was largely completed during 2023 with certain capital investments finalized in\nearly 2024.\nCapitalized implementation costs associated with the ERP implementation totaled $32.8 million, of which $3.7 million and $29.1 million were included in \"Prepaid\nexpenses and other assets\" and \"Other long-term assets,\" respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. Capitalized\nimplementation costs totaled $30.6 million, of which $3.3 million and $27.3 million were included in \"Prepaid expenses and other assets\" and \"Other long-term\nassets,\" respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023.\n17\nINDEX\nCosts associated with these strategic transformation programs are presented below:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nStrategic transformation programs\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 8.6 $ 7.7 $ 26.0 $ 22.6\nCost of sales 0.1 0.1 0.4 0.2\nTotal costs related to strategic transformation initiatives $ 8.7 $ 7.8 $ 26.4 $ 22.8\nAmortization of capitalized implementation costs (a) $ 1.0 $ 0.7 $ 2.7 $ 1.2\n(a) Amortization of capitalized implementation costs is recorded in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn addition, the Company periodically sells or disposes of its assets in the normal course of its business operations as they are no longer needed or used and\nmay incur gains or losses on these disposals.

GEFCO, Inc., related to the\nCompany's former Enid, Oklahoma site, for $8.4 million. In connection with the settlement, management recorded a loss within the Infrastructure Solutions\nsegment of $8.4 million in \"Restructuring, impairment and other asset charges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and \"Other current liabilities\"\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the third quarter of 2024. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion of this matter.\nIn January 2021, the Company announced plans to close the Tacoma, Washington facility in order to simplify and consolidate operations within the Infrastructure\nSolutions segment. The sale of the Tacoma facility's land, building and certain equipment assets was completed in the first quarter of 2023 for $19.9 million. The\nCompany recorded a gain on the sale of $3.4 million, which was recorded in \"Restructuring, other impairment and asset charges, net\" in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nEffective as of January 6, 2023, Mr. Barry A. Ruffalo's employment as President and CEO was terminated. In connection with his separation, the Company\nentered into an agreement with Mr. Ruffalo (the \"Separation Agreement\"), pursuant to which Mr. Ruffalo was entitled to certain severance payments and\nbenefits. During the first quarter of 2023, $1.8 million of restructuring costs, related to the modification of Mr. Ruffalo's equity awards and other third-party\ntransition support costs, were recorded in \"Restructuring, other impairment and asset charges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The related\nrecovery of $1.6 million of incurred share-based compensation expense was recorded in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations during the first quarter of 2023. The Separation Agreement also included a release and waiver by Mr. Ruffalo and other customary\nprovisions.\nManagement continually reviews the Company's organizational structure and operations to ensure they are optimized and aligned with achieving near-term and\nlong-term operational and profitability targets. In connection with this review, the Company effected workforce reductions during the second quarter of 2024,\nwhereby charges of $0.9 million were incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and recorded in \"Restructuring, other impairment and asset\ncharges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In February 2023, the Company implemented a limited restructuring plan to right-size and reduce\nthe fixed cost structure of certain overhead departments. Total charges of $5.5 million for employee termination costs, including equity award modifications, were\nrecorded in \"Restructuring, other impairment and asset charges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations of which $5.2 million and $0.3 million were\nrecorded in the first and second quarters of 2023, respectively. The related recovery of $1.0 million of incurred share-based compensation expense was\nrecorded in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations of which $0.8 million and $0.2 million were recorded in\nthe first and second quarters of 2023, respectively.\nAsset impairment charges of $0.8 million were incurred related to abandoned in-process internally developed software that was determined to be impaired\nduring the second quarter of 2023.\nNote 12. (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share\nBasic (loss) earnings per common share is determined by dividing \"Net (loss) income attributable to controlling interest\" by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted (loss) earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents,\nconsisting of restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock\n19\nINDEX\nheld in the Company's deferred compensation programs, using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares that have an antidilutive effect (i.e., those\nthat increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Performance stock units, which are\nconsidered contingently issuable, are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per common share:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDenominator:\nDenominator for basic earnings per common share 22,816,359 22,746,783 22,791,819 22,709,238\nEffect of dilutive securities — — — 66,920\nDenominator for diluted earnings per common share 22,816,359 22,746,783 22,791,819 22,776,158\nAntidilutive securities excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings\nper share 63,173 67,408 78,473 9,345\n20\nINDEX\nItem 2.

All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we\nassume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nExecutive Summary\nHighlights of our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year include the following:\n• Net sales were $291.4 million, a decrease of 3.9%\n• Gross profit was $66.8 million, a decrease of 4.0%\n• Loss from operations was $7.2 million, an increase of 38.5%\n• Net loss attributable to Astec was $6.2 million, a decrease of 6.1%\n• Diluted loss per share was $0.27, a decrease of 6.9%\n• Backlog was $475.9 million, a decrease of 22.6%\nBusiness Conditions and Trends\nStrategic Transformation – We are undergoing a multi-year phased implementation of a standardized ERP system, which is replacing much of our existing\ndisparate core financial systems. During the second quarter of 2024, we modified the pace of deployment of future site conversions in order to improve\nefficiencies and reduce business disruptions at each manufacturing site, which will have the effect of reducing the scope to exclude sites outside North America.\nTo date, we have launched the human capital resources module in our locations in the United States and converted the operations of three manufacturing sites\nalong with Corporate, two of which occurred during the second quarter of 2024. We expect the project to conclude in 2027 with total approximate implementation\ncosts anticipated to range from $180 to $200 million. Through the third quarter of 2024, we have incurred total implementation costs of approximately $127\nmillion. Annual costs are expected to peak in 2024 to a range of $40 to $45 million and decrease annually each year through the final implementations in 2027.\nIn addition, a lean manufacturing initiative at one of our largest sites was largely completed during 2023 with certain capital investments finalized in early 2024.\nThese investments, along with the other elements of the initiative, are expected to drive improvement in gross margin at that site in the second half of 2025.\n21\nINDEX\nSee Note 11, Strategic Transformation, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Asset Charges, net of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion of the costs related to these strategic initiatives.\nGoodwill Impairment – During the second quarter of 2024, we identified that indicators of goodwill impairment were present due to macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding declines in our publicly quoted share price and increased interest rates, as well as lower than expected operating results. These factors indicated that\none or more of our reporting units may have fallen below their carrying amounts. We performed a qualitative assessment on all reporting units and concluded\nthat a further quantitative analysis was required for the Materials Solutions reporting unit. Based on the quantitative impairment test, we determined that the\ncarrying value of the Materials Solutions reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of June 30, 2024. As a result, we recognized a pretax non-cash goodwill\nimpairment charge of $20.2 million in \"Goodwill impairment\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to fully impair the goodwill allocated to the Materials\nSolutions reporting unit.\nVenVer Litigation – On October 8, 2024, we reached an agreement to resolve the action styled VenVer S.A. and Americas Coil Tubing LLP v. GEFCO, Inc. for\n$8.4 million. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a loss of $8.4 million in \"Restructuring, impairment and other asset charges, net\" in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and \"Other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the third quarter of 2024. See Note 8, Commitments and\nContingencies of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further\ndiscussion of this matter.\n37 BP Litigation – In September 2024, we reached an agreement for $6.3 million, which we paid in September 2024, to resolve the matter styled 37 Building\nProducts, Ltd. v. Telsmith, Inc., et al. originally filed on January 28, 2019. Upon settlement, the full loss contingency of $8.2 million, inclusive of post-judgment\ninterest, that was recorded as of June 30, 2024 was released. The $1.9 million net impact of the loss contingency release and the final settlement amount was\nrecorded in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter of 2024. See Note 8,\nCommitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor further discussion of this matter.\nSegment Changes – Our two reportable segments are comprised of sites based upon the nature of the products or services produced, the type of customer for\nthe products, the similarity of economic characteristics, the manner in which management reviews results and the nature of the production process, among other\nconsiderations. Based on a review of these factors, our Australia and LatAm sites and Astec Digital have changed reportable segments beginning January 1,\n2024. The Australia and LatAm sites were previously reported in the Infrastructure Solutions segment and have moved to the Materials Solutions segment. Astec\nDigital was previously included in the Corporate and Other category and has moved to the Infrastructure Solutions segment. Prior periods have been revised to\nreflect the changes to the segment composition for comparability.\nEconomic Conditions – We monitor macroeconomic and other factors that may affect our business such as steel and oil prices, interest rates and geopolitical\nconflicts, among others.\nSteel is a major component of our equipment. We anticipate that steel prices will remain consistent, and that steel demand will remain relatively stable\nthroughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.\nAdditionally, significant portions of our revenues from the Infrastructure Solutions segment relate to the sale of equipment involved in the production, handling,\nrecycling or application of asphalt mix. Liquid asphalt is a by-product of oil refining, and changes in the price of oil impact the cost of asphalt, which is in turn\nlikely to alter demand for asphalt and therefore affect demand for certain of our products. Based on the current macroeconomic environment, including ongoing\ninternational conflicts, we anticipate that oil prices will remain at relatively high levels throughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.\nElevated interest rates influence our customers' spending patterns, most notably impacting our dealer customers in the Materials Solutions segment. Interest\nrates have, in part, driven the decrease in our order backlog. While interest rates in the United States have fallen slightly in the third quarter of 2024, they remain\nat historically elevated levels. Additionally, our revolving credit loans bear interest on a variable basis and are subject to market volatility. We anticipate\ncontinuing to utilize the Credit Facilities with more frequency in the near term to support our working capital needs. Due to the increased borrowings under our\nCredit Facilities and higher interest rates, we expect our interest expense in the near term to remain at elevated levels.\nNew or ongoing geopolitical conflicts may cause a downturn in the commercial and residential construction industries in which we operate, cause an increase in\noil prices, damage a significant portion of our inventory or materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers. We monitor, adjust and potentially\ncease our operations in affected jurisdictions to ensure compliance with any governmental actions made in response to such conflicts.\nWhenever possible, we attempt to cover increased costs of production by adjusting the prices of our products. The markets we serve are competitive in nature,\nand competition limits our ability to pass through cost increases in many cases.\n22\nINDEX\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the third quarter of 2024 were $291.4 million compared to $303.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $11.7 million, or 3.9%. The\ndecrease in net sales was primarily driven by net unfavorable volume and mix partially offset by favorable pricing that generated decreases in equipment and\nparts and component sales of $7.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in equipment installation revenue\nof $1.1 million. Sales reported by our foreign subsidiaries in U.S. dollars for the third quarter of 2024 would have been $0.3 million lower had third quarter 2024\nforeign exchange rates been the same as third quarter 2023 rates.\nNet sales for the first nine months of 2024 were $946.1 million compared to $1,001.0 million for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of $54.9 million, or\n5.5%. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by net unfavorable volume and mix partially offset by favorable pricing that generated decreases in (i)\nequipment sales of $34.6 million, (ii) service and equipment installation revenue of $19.2 million, (iii) used equipment of $4.3 million and (iv) freight revenue of\n$3.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other revenue and parts and component sales of $3.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively.\nSales reported by our foreign subsidiaries in U.S. dollars for the first nine months of 2024 would have been $0.9 million higher had the first nine months of 2024\nforeign exchange rates been the same as the first nine months of 2023 rates.\nDomestic sales for the third quarter of 2024 were $211.2 million, or 72.5% of consolidated net sales, compared to $229.6 million, or 75.8% of consolidated net\nsales, for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $18.4 million, or 8.0%. Domestic sales decreased primarily due to decreases in equipment and parts and\ncomponents sales of $13.1 million and $6.8 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by increased service and equipment installation revenue\nof $1.1 million.\nDomestic sales for the first nine months of 2024 were $726.5 million, or 76.8% of consolidated net sales, compared to $797.3 million, or 79.7% of consolidated\nnet sales, for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of $70.8 million, or 8.9%. Domestic sales decreased primarily due to decreases in (i) equipment sales of\n$47.5 million, (ii) service and equipment installation revenue of $20.1 million, (iii) used equipment sales of $2.5 million, (iv) freight revenue of $2.4 million and (v)\nparts and component sales of $2.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased other revenue of $3.9 million.\nInternational sales for the third quarter of 2024 were $80.2 million, or 27.5% of consolidated net sales, compared to $73.5 million, or 24.2% of consolidated net\nsales, for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $6.7 million, or 9.1%. International sales increased primarily due to increases in equipment sales and parts\nand component sales of $5.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nInternational sales for the first nine months of 2024 were $219.6 million, or 23.2% of consolidated net sales, compared to $203.7 million, or 20.3% of\nconsolidated net sales, for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of $15.9 million, or 7.8%. International sales increased primarily due to increases in\nequipment sales and parts and component sales of $12.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreased used\nequipment sales of $1.8 million.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $66.8 million, or 22.9% of net sales, as compared to $69.6 million, or 23.0% of net sales, for the third quarter of\n2023, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 4.0%. The decrease was primarily driven by manufacturing inefficiencies of $5.9 million and the impact of inflation on\nmaterials, labor and overhead of $3.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by the sales impact of favorable pricing partially offset by net unfavorable\nvolume and mix of $5.4 million and $1.0 million of favorable inventory period costs.\nGross profit for the first nine months of 2024 was $225.0 million, or 23.8% of net sales, as compared to $241.7 million, or 24.1% of net sales, for the first nine\nmonths of 2023, a decrease of $16.7 million, or 6.9%. The decrease was primarily driven by manufacturing inefficiencies of $24.2 million and the impact of\ninflation on materials, labor and overhead of $8.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by the sales impact of favorable pricing partially offset by net\nunfavorable volume and mix of $15.4 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.7 million, or 11.7%, to $65.6 million, or 22.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to\n$74.3 million, or 24.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2023. The decreases in selling general and administrative expenses are primarily due to (i) the loss\ncontingency related to the 37 BP litigation, of which $6.4 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the $1.9 million benefit from the loss\ncontingency release offset by the final settlement amount recorded during the third quarter of 2024, (ii) decreased employee incentive compensation costs of\n$1.5 million and (iii) lower bad debt expense of $1.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher technology support costs and certain professional\nservices of $1.4 million and higher costs related to our strategic transformation program of $0.9 million.\n23\nINDEX\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.4 million, or 0.7%, to $208.1 million, or 22.0% of net sales, for the first nine months of 2024,\ncompared to $206.7 million, or 20.6% of net sales, for the first nine months of 2023. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily\ndue to (i) increased personnel-related costs of $8.1 million, which includes the recovery of share-based compensation expense in the prior year that did not recur\nfor awards that were forfeited or modified in conjunction with the termination of our previous CEO and the limited overhead restructuring action implemented in\nFebruary 2023 of $2.6 million, (ii) higher technology support costs and certain professional services of $6.9 million and (iii) higher costs related to our strategic\ntransformation program of $3.4 million. These increases were partially offset by (i) the loss contingency related to the 37 BP litigation, of which $6.4 million was\nrecorded in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the $1.9 million benefit from the loss contingency release offset by the final settlement amount recorded\nduring the third quarter of 2024, (ii) decreased employee incentive costs of $5.1 million and (iii) decreased exhibit and promotional costs of $1.3 million.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe determined that the carrying value of the Materials Solutions reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of June 30, 2024. As a result, we recognized a pretax\nnon-cash goodwill impairment charge of $20.2 million in \"Goodwill impairment\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to fully impair the goodwill\nallocated to the Materials Solutions reporting unit during the second quarter of 2024. After this impairment charge, no net goodwill related to Materials Solutions\nis reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2024. See Note 4, Goodwill of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nPart I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussion of the pretax non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other Asset Charges and Gains, net\nRestructuring, asset impairment charges and the loss (gain) on sale of property and equipment, net for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 are presented below:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRestructuring charges:\nCosts associated with exited operations – Enid $ 8.4 $ 0.1 $ 8.5 $ 0.3\nWorkforce reductions — — 0.9 —\nCosts associated with leadership change and overhead restructuring — — — 7.3\nTotal restructuring related charges 8.4 0.1 9.4 7.6\nAsset impairment charges:\nOther impairment charges — — — 0.8\nTotal asset impairment charges — — — 0.8\nLoss (gain) on sale of property and equipment, net:\nLoss (gain) on sale of property and equipment, net — 0.4 (1.1) (3.1)\nTotal loss (gain) on sale of property and equipment, net — 0.4 (1.1) (3.1)\nRestructuring, other impairment and asset charges, net $ 8.4 $ 0.5 $ 8.3 $ 5.3\nSee Note 11, Strategic Transformation, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Asset Charges, net of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussion of the individual restructuring actions taken.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $2.6 million and $8.4 million was incurred in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $2.4 million\nand $6.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily related to higher average outstanding borrowings on the Credit\nFacility in 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023.\n24\nINDEX\nIncome Tax\nOur income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Our effective income tax rate was\n27.1% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8.5% for the third quarter of 2023. The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was\nhigher compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher pretax book loss and changes in the relative weighting of jurisdictional income and loss.\nOur income tax benefit for the first nine months of 2024 was $0.6 million compared to a provision of $6.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. Our effective\ntax rate was 3.4% for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 25.7% for the first nine months of 2023. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to an expense in the same period in 2023, was primarily due to lower pretax book income and changes in the relative\nweighting of jurisdictional income and loss, partially offset by a net nondeductible goodwill impairment.\nBacklog\nThe backlog of orders as of September 30, 2024 was $475.8 million compared to $614.7 million as of September 30, 2023, a decrease of $138.9 million, or\n22.6%. Domestic backlog decreased $133.0 million, or 26.0%, and international backlog decreased $5.9 million, or 5.7%. The backlog decreased $43.6 million\nto $351.1 million in the Infrastructure Solutions segment and decreased $95.3 million to $124.7 million in the Materials Solutions segment.\nStrong customer demand and logistics and manufacturing throughput disruptions in 2021 and 2022 resulted in a build of backlog, which peaked in late 2022. The\norder backlog began to decrease throughout 2023 driven by sales delivery outpacing new orders and is approaching a historical range. Macroeconomic factors\nsuch as higher inflation and increased interest rates, among other factors, have influenced customer ordering patterns and are expected to continue. We have\nexperienced variability in the ordering patterns from our dealer customers, most notably in the Materials Solutions segment, as a result of these factors. In\naddition, our shorter production lead times allow for customers to place orders closer to when the equipment delivery is desired. In order to support sales\ndelivery and maintain optimal backlog levels, we have completed prudent expansions of our production capacity at certain manufacturing sites that we anticipate\nwill allow us to more effectively convert backlog to sales in the future with greater efficiency and shorter lead times.\nSegment Net Sales – Three Months Ended:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions, except percentage data) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nInfrastructure Solutions $ 165.0 $ 163.2 $ 1.8 1.1 %\nMaterials Solutions 126.4 139.9 (13.5) (9.6)%\nInfrastructure Solutions\nSales in this segment were $165.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $163.2 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $1.8 million, or\n1.1%.

As of September 30, 2024, our total liquidity was $195.1 million, consisting of $52.7 million of cash and cash equivalents available for operating\npurposes and $142.4 million available for additional borrowings under the Credit Facility, subject to our continued compliance with financial covenants under the\nCredit Agreement. Our foreign subsidiaries held $34.3 million of cash and cash equivalents available for operating purposes, which is considered to be\nindefinitely invested in those jurisdictions.\nOur future cash requirements primarily include working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, vendor-hosted software arrangements\nincluding the related implementation costs, unrecognized tax benefits and operating lease payments. In addition, our variable cash uses may include the\npayment of our quarterly cash dividend, financing other strategic initiatives of our business, including, but not limited to, transformation initiatives, strategic\nacquisitions and share repurchases under our share repurchase authorization. We believe that our current working capital, cash flows generated from future\noperations and available capacity under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements for our existing\nbusiness for at least the next 12 months.\nOn December 19, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and\nthe lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a revolving credit facility (consisting of revolving credit loans and swingline loans) and a letter of\ncredit facility, in an aggregate amount of up to $250.0 million, (ii) an incremental credit facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $125.0 million (the \"Credit\nFacilities\") and (iii) a maturity date of December 19, 2027. The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including requirements related to our\nConsolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, each as defined in the agreement. Failure to satisfy these covenants could\nresult in the accelerated repayment of our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2024.\nWe had $99.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2024. Our outstanding letters of credit totaling $8.6 million\ndecreased borrowing availability to $142.4 million under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. We anticipate continuing to utilize the Credit\nFacilities with more frequency in the near term to support our working capital needs. Due to the increased borrowings under our Credit Facilities and higher\ninterest rates, we expect our interest expense in the near term to remain at elevated levels.\nCertain of our international subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa and the United Kingdom each have separate credit facilities with local financial\ninstitutions primarily to finance short-term working capital needs and to cover foreign exchange contracts, performance letters of credit, advance payment and\nretention guarantees. In addition, the Brazilian subsidiary also enters into order anticipation agreements on a periodic basis. Both the outstanding borrowings\nunder the credit facilities of the international subsidiaries and the order anticipation agreements are recorded in \"Short-term debt\" in our Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Each of the credit facilities are generally guaranteed by Astec Industries, Inc. and/or secured with certain assets of the local subsidiary.\nWe regularly enter into agreements, primarily to purchase inventory, in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, open purchase obligations\ntotaled $121.9 million, of which $95.7 million are expected to be fulfilled within the remainder of 2024.\nWe estimate that our capital expenditures will be between $20.0 million and $25.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2024, which may be impacted by\ngeneral economic, financial or operational changes and competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other considerations.\n28\nINDEX\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (13.6) $ (18.8)\nNet cash used in investing activities (14.0) (3.9)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 19.5 30.8\nEffect of exchange rates on cash 0.2 (0.3)\n(Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (7.9) 7.8\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period $ 55.3 $ 73.8\nNet cash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased by $5.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, primarily due to lower net cash usages for our operating assets and liabilities of $24.2 million partially offset by reduced cash inflows from\nnet income reduced by non-cash charges of $19.7 million. The decreased net cash usage for our operating assets and liabilities were mainly driven by the timing\nof inventory purchases of $49.8 million and increases in customer deposits of $21.7 million. The decreased net cash usage was partially offset by the timing of\npayments on trade accounts payables of $35.6 million and higher employee-related payments of $14.0 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $14.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $3.9 million during the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the cash inflows from the sale of the Tacoma facility's land, building and certain equipment assets for $19.9 million\nin the first quarter of 2023 that did not recur. This was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures of $9.0 million during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nOur financing activities provided net cash of $19.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to providing net cash of $30.8 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased borrowings, net of repayments, of $12.5 million.\nDividends\nWe paid quarterly dividends of $0.13 per common share to shareholders in the third quarter of both 2024 and 2023.\nShare Repurchases\nAs announced on July 30, 2018, we approved a share repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our common stock. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, $115.7 million remains available for repurchase under the approved share repurchase program. No shares were repurchased under the\nplan during the three months ended September 30, 2024; however, we may conduct opportunistic share repurchases under this authorization in future periods\nutilizing cash on hand or borrowings under our Credit Facilities. The timing, manner and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, credit availability, financial performance, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the\nmarket price of our stock and the availability of alternative investment opportunities.\nFinancial Condition\nOur total current assets increased to $740.1 million as of September 30, 2024 from $719.5 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $20.6 million, or\n2.9%, due primarily to (i) increases of $22.5 million in trade and other receivables, which includes a $13.7 million receivable from our insurance carriers recorded\nin the first quarter of 2024 related to a pending litigation settlement and (ii) increased inventory of $10.8 million. These increases were partially offset by\ndecreases in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $7.9 million.\nOur total current liabilities increased to $299.2 million as of September 30, 2024 from $299.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Increases of $20.9 million and\n$13.8 million in other current liabilities and customer deposits, respectively, were partially offset by\n29\nINDEX\ndecreases in accounts payables of $29.1 million. The increase in other current liabilities includes $13.7 million related to a pending litigation settlement\ncorresponding to the related receivable from our insurance carriers.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur critical accounting estimates are described \"Part II, Item 7. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\"\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. With the exception of the estimates utilized in the quantitative assessment for\ngoodwill related to our Materials Solutions reporting unit, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 was filed.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from \"Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our market risk exposures have not materially changed since\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 was filed.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by\nus in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities\nand Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and Chief\nFinancial Officer (\"CFO\"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision\nand with the participation of our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe are currently undertaking a significant multi-year global ERP implementation to upgrade our information technology platforms and business processes. The\nimplementation is occurring in phases over several years, which began in 2023. During 2023, we implemented the human capital resources management\nmodule, including the payroll application for all locations within the United States, the ERP at Corporate and one manufacturing site and the consolidations and\nreporting module. During the second quarter of 2024, we implemented the ERP at two additional manufacturing sites.\nAs a result of this multi-year implementation, we expect certain changes to our processes and procedures, which, in turn, will result in changes to our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. While we expect this implementation to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting by automating certain manual\nprocesses and standardizing business processes and reporting across our organization, we will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as processes and procedures in the affected areas evolve.\nWith the exception of the implementations described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-\n15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n30\nINDEX\nPART II ‑ OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. Except as noted elsewhere in this Report, there are no pending\nor threatened litigation proceedings that our management believes will result in an outcome that would materially affect our business, financial position, cash\nflows or results of operations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that future litigation to which we become a party will not have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nSee Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for information regarding material legal proceedings in which we are involved.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.

As a reminder, this\nconference call is being recorded.\nIt is my pleasure to introduce your host, Steve Anderson, Senior Vice President of Administration and\nInvestor Relations.\nMr. Anderson, you may begin.\nStephen C. Anderson\nSenior VP of Administration, Investor Relations & Corporate Secretary\nThank you and welcome to the Astec Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's\ncall are President and Chief Executive Officer, Jaco van der Merwe; our newly appointed Chief Financial\nOfficer, Brian Harris; and Vice President of Finance for Infrastructure Solutions, Heinrich Jonker. In just a\nmoment, I'll turn the call over to Jaco to provide comments and then Brian and Heinrich will summarize\nour financial results.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that our discussion this morning may contain forward-looking statements\nthat relate to the future performance of the company and these statements are intended to qualify for the\nsafe harbor liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nAny such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions. Factors that can influence our results are highlighted in today's earnings\nrelease and others are contained in our filings with the SEC. As usual, we ask that you familiarize yourself\nwith those factors. The company refers to various U.S. GAAP, which are generally accepted accounting\nprinciples and non-GAAP financial measures, which management believes provide useful information to\ninvestors.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and\nare, therefore, unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies.\nManagement of the company does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute\nfor the related U.S. GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our earnings release and the appendix\nof our slide deck. All related earnings materials are posted on our website at www.astecindustries.com,\nincluding our presentation, which is under the Investor Relations and Presentation tabs.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jaco.\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin, I would like to\nwelcome Brian Harris, who, as you know, joined us as Astec's new Chief Financial Officer a few weeks ago.\nWe are thrilled to have Brian on board. He brings with him significant experience, having held leadership\nroles across several public companies. Most recently, he spent 10 years as the Chief Financial Officer\nof Summit Materials, a leading producer of aggregates, concrete and asphalt and we look forward to\nbenefiting from his experience.\nI will hand it over to Brian to say a few words about himself at the start of the financial results section. I\nwould also like to take this opportunity to thank Heinrich for stepping in as Interim Chief Financial Officer\nand providing the leadership needed at an important time in Astec's journey. I look forward to continue\nworking with Heinrich as Vice President of Finance in our Infrastructure Solutions segment.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nASTEC INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nWith that, we will turn to our third quarter highlights summarized on Slide 5. We remain focused on\nexecuting against our strategy and key operational initiatives to strengthen our foundation and position\nthe company for growth. In the third quarter, we had mixed results. On a consolidated basis, we delivered\n$291.4 million in net sales, which was slightly less on a year-over-year basis due to reductions in\nequipment and parts sales. Gross margin was stable and generally in line with the prior year. Importantly,\nwe were cash flow positive in the quarter, having generated $19.9 million of free cash flow.\nIn Infrastructure Solutions, we benefited from the strong infrastructure construction market, which\ncontinued to generate healthy demand for asphalt and concrete plant deliveries. The infrastructure\nconstruction market is supported by a long-term runway for federal highway projects. Dealer inventory\nlevels and interest rates continue to influence the Material Solutions segment, resulting in slower product\nconversions. As stated previously, we do believe inventory levels will moderate over the next 2 to 3\nquarters and the Federal Reserve's interest rate reduction of 50 basis points in September was welcome\nnews to our dealers and customers.\nFinally, turning to backlog. We ended the quarter at $476 million. As I've noted, we saw a bit of a\ndivergence in backlog between our 2 segments, with Infrastructure Solutions evidencing a relatively stable\ntrend and Material Solutions showing moderating trends.\nOn Slide 6, we gave an update on our strategic road map. As you will recall, we introduced this new\nstrategic framework earlier this year as we align the organization's focus on 3 core pillars: the combination\nof fostering empowered, enabled and engaged employees; being laser-focused on our customers; and\ncontinuing to provide industry-changing innovations is our strategic road map for the remainder of 2024\nand beyond.\nWe are pleased to see our 2024 Voice of OneASTEC employee survey results showed positive trends and\nalignment on our goals and objectives was evident. The positive changes made to our business over the\npast 1.5 years will enhance our ability to execute for our customers and drive value for our shareholders.\nTurning now to Slide 7. Let me share some observations on our current business dynamics for our\nInfrastructure Solutions and Materials Solutions segments. While the quarter experienced various sector\nchallenges, the overall outlook for domestic road building is encouraging. The Infrastructure Investment\nJobs Act disbursements are expected to continue at a high level and states continue to invest.\nFor example, Texas Governor Abbott announced a record $148 billion 10-year investment for state\ntransportation infrastructure. In addition, the Federal Highway Administration recently released $134\nmillion to repair roads in North Carolina, Tennessee and South Carolina damaged by Hurricane Helene.\nWe expect continued strong demand for asphalt road building and concrete production equipment moving\nforward. I should note that our paving and forestry products are also sold through a dealer distribution\nnetwork that experiences the same interest rate pressures felt by our Material Solutions dealer. That said,\nwe are encouraged by the record bookings for parts in our Infrastructure Solutions segment during the\nmonth of October.\nMany of the factors in the Infrastructure Solutions segment are also positive for our Material Solutions\nsegment. As I'm sure you know, aggregates are used as base materials for roads and are key ingredients\nfor asphalt and concrete. Although dealer destocking continues to present a near-term headwind, lower\ninterest rates promised to relieve debt servicing requirements for our dealers and end users.\nOur OneASTEC business model has also helped as we have been able to share facility capacity among site,\nboth of which are beneficial for absorption and workforce retention. As with the Infrastructure Solutions\nsegment, parts bookings for the month of October were strong.\nSlide 8 shows our backlog levels, which continue to moderate. As I noted earlier, the backlog trends\nunderscore the relative stability in Infrastructure Solutions, while Material Solutions has been challenged in\nthe short term by excess inventory in the dealer channel and higher interest rates.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nOn Slide 9, our implied orders of $236 million was slightly higher than the prior year third quarter level of\n$229 million. Year-over-year growth of Infrastructure Solutions implied orders of $29 million was partially\noffset by a $21 million decline in Material Solutions.\nDespite an overall reduction sequentially, we are encouraged by solid dealer quoting for future Material\nSolutions bookings and sales. As previously shared, our strategic road map includes an industry-changing\ninnovation pillar and I am proud of our progress on new product development shown on Slide 10.\nThrough our 52-year history, Astec has been recognized as a leader in innovation, which is a fundamental\nelement of our company. A great example of this is our new Astec ReMix Cold Central Plant Recycle\nor CCPR system. The CCPR system is a cold recycling technology. It is a sustainable approach to road\nconstruction that minimizes the environmental impact.\nBy using reclaimed asphalt pavement materials and mixing them at ambient temperatures, our system\nminimize cost by significantly reducing the need for both virgin aggregate and the energy needed for\nheating the mix.\nWe have multiple prototypes running in the field with positive results. We are excited about providing this\nsolution to our customers.\nSlide 11 also showcases the sustainability of our products, which is a critical important component of our\nofferings. We strive to be environmentally responsible pillars of the communities in which we work and\nlive. We are also committed to decreasing the carbon footprint of our own operations while supporting our\ncustomers on their sustainability journeys.\nA good example of this is our 6750B wood grinder, which enables high-volume recycling of organic waste\nand supports the production of alternative biomass fuels. Another example is our RX-405 cold planner,\nwhich utilizes a Stage 5 engine to minimize emissions while facilitating the reclaiming and reuse of asphalt\nmaterials from existing roads.\nAnd finally, our double-barrel XHR produces asphalt materials with up to 65% recycled content. These\nproducts and many others evidence our commitment to continually develop innovative products that drive\nprogress towards a more sustainable environment.\nThat concludes my remarks. So let me now turn it over to Brian to introduce himself. Brian?\nBrian J. Harris\nChief Financial Officer\nThank you, Jaco. It's a pleasure to be here and to be part of the Astec team. Having been in the industry\nover the last 10 years, I have long admired and respected Astec for its high-quality, innovative products\nand the high caliber of its people. I am particularly excited to join Astec at this pivotal stage.\nJaco and the team have navigated through a challenging time and have built a strong foundation for the\nbusiness. There is more work to do, but I'm very encouraged by everything I've seen thus far and I'm\nconfident in the opportunity for growth and value creation ahead.\nAs I continue to settle into this new role, I look forward to speaking with you about Q4 and fiscal 2024\nresults in the New Year.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Heinrich to review Q3 results.\nHeinrich Jonker\nFormer Interim Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Brian and good morning, everyone. Diving into the numbers on Slide 13. Net sales decreased\n3.9% to $291.4 million in the quarter year-over-year. As Jaco said earlier, we continue to see strong\ndemand for asphalt and concrete plant equipment and a decrease for Material Solutions products. By\nregion, domestic sales accounted for approximately 72% of consolidated net sales with international\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nASTEC INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\ncomprising the remaining 28%. Overall, net domestic sales were down 8% year-over-year, while\ninternational sales increased 9.1%.\nBy segment, Infrastructure Solutions net sales increased 1.1% year-over-year, while Material Solutions\nsales decreased 9.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 74% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 270\nbasis points. As seen on the slide, adjusted EBITDA margins increased largely due to positive net volume,\nmix and pricing, lower SG&A costs from a favorable legal settlement initially recorded in last year's third\nquarter, lower bad debt and employee-related costs, offset by manufacturing inefficiencies.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $0.31 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS\nexcludes transformation and other costs of $0.58 in the third quarter 2024 and $0.28 in the third quarter\n2023. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 18.6%.\nOn Slide 14, I'll discuss the results from Infrastructure Solutions segment. Net sales increased 1.1% to\n$165 million, which was a result of a $8.4 million increase in equipment sales that was partly offset by a\n$7.7 million decline in part sales.\nBased on customer feedback, we believe the decline is a result of timing and not a downward trend.\nSegment operating adjusted EBITDA increased 17.3% to $15.6 million and segment operating adjusted\nEBITDA margin improved 140 basis points to 9.5%, mainly due to positive net volume, mix and pricing\nand lower SG&A costs, partly offset by manufacturing inefficiencies.\nMoving to Slide 15. Materials Solutions net sales decreased 9.6% to $126.4 million, driven by lower\ndomestic equipment sales, which were attributable to continued finance capacity constraints with\ncontractors and dealers as well as longer product conversions. This decline was partly offset by stronger\npart sales, which increased 9.6%.\nSegment operating adjusted EBITDA increased 52.6% to $14.5 million and segment operating adjusted\nEBITDA margin increased 470 basis points to 11.5%. This was primarily due to a $2 million benefit from a\nlegal settlement as compared to the initial $6.4 million legal charge in the prior year third quarter.\nWe continued our cost reduction efforts in the quarter and sharing facility capacity to help meet demand\nwithin the Infrastructure Solutions segment, which contributed to our adjusted EBITDA as well.\nTurning to our adjusted EBITDA bridge on Slide 16. For the quarter, we delivered a increase in adjusted\nEBITDA of $7.4 million. We realized the benefit from volume, pricing and mix and experienced negative\nimpacts from inflation, manufacturing inefficiencies and other period costs.\nOn Slide 17, you can see we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $52.7 million, available\ncredit of $142.4 million and total available liquidity of $195.1 million. Our operating activities were a\n$22.5 million source of cash for the third quarter. Our free cash flow was $19.9 million in the quarter\nand we continue to have ample liquidity and a strong balance sheet. Driving commercial and operational\nexcellence will continue to be our capital allocation priorities while continuing to explore inorganic growth\nopportunities.\nThat concludes our financial overview and I will turn the call back over to Jaco.\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nThank you, Heinrich. As noted on Slide 18, we continue to work through a challenging market environment\nin the third quarter, but made important progress on our key initiatives and the underlying fundamentals\nof the business remain robust. As we look at our 2 segments, Infrastructure Solutions remains strong with\nhealthy demand for asphalt and concrete plant deliveries through the beginning of 2025. We are seeing\nstrong dealer rental and quoting activity in Material Solutions. However, there continue to be near-term\nheadwinds from ample dealer inventory levels and interest rate carrying costs.\nWe have taken action to optimize our footprint, which includes cross-site manufacturing at select sites\nto balance demand and capacity. We are focused on driving cost efficiencies, taking pricing action and\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nASTEC INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nmaking operational enhancements to support margin improvement. We are confident that we are taking\nthe right steps to position Astec to drive sustainable growth as markets improve.\nConcluding with investment highlights on Slide 19. Astec is a trusted source of globally recognized brands\nand high-quality solutions for our customers. Many of our customers have told us they have considerable\nbacklog stretching into next year. Our operational excellence efforts will continue to position us to provide\nour customers with the products they need when they need them.\nOur business has several growth drivers, a few of which are our exciting new product pipeline, a stable\nand growing recurring parts revenue business that currently represents 25% to 30% of our total revenue,\nincreased multiyear federal and state funding for interstates and highways, expansion opportunities in\ncurrent and future international markets and inorganic growth opportunities that are strategically aligned\nand meet our financial criteria.\nBased on current sales and order activity in Q4, we expect full year sales to be broadly flat compared to\nthe prior year. The equipment, parts and service mix in Q4 are expected to result in gross margins at the\nlower end of our previously provided range of 24% to 25.5%. We continue to feel quarterly SG&A will be\nin the range of $59 million to $62 million. CapEx for the full year are expected to be in the $20 million to\n$25 million range. We are diligently working to build consistency to realize the full potential of Astec and\nare excited about the future.\nWith that, operator, we are happy to take questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mirc Dobre of Baird.\nJoseph Michael Grabowski\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nIt's Joe Grabowski on for Mirc this morning. And Brian, welcome. Maybe starting with you, maybe talk a\nlittle bit more about what attracted you to the opportunity at Astec. And again, maybe a little more on any\ninitial thoughts you've had.\nBrian J. Harris\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. Thanks, Joe. Thanks for the question and I appreciate everybody's participation on the call today.\nIt's been a journey for Astec. Jaco and the team have been working on their strategic road map and their\ntransformation journey for the past 18 months. They've built this tremendous foundation.\nAnd as I said in my opening remarks, there's a fantastic management team here, deep industry\nknowledge, great expertise and really professional approach to the business. I saw this as an opportunity\nfor value creation for shareholders.\nJaco just talked about some of the growth drivers that we have in the business from products to parts\nrevenue growth, new product pipeline. We've got a lot of infrastructure funding already in place, which will\nbe there for the next several years, international growth opportunities. So it's really a great time to be at\nAstec and I'm just delighted to be part of the team.\nJoseph Michael Grabowski\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nGreat. Again, welcome. Look forward to working with you. And my next question would be just a\nclarification. I know last third quarter, there was a $6.4 million litigation charge. Was there a favorable\nimpact to EBITDA from a legal settlement in this third quarter? Or are we just saying it was a favorable\ncomparison?\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nI can maybe start with that, Joe. So first of all, I just want to make a comment overall is that we are really\ndriving consistency here and getting these historic legal cases out of our system is one of those things that\nwe're focusing on.\nBut yes, last year, in the third quarter, we booked $6.4 million. And then since that time, we've accrued\nadditional expenses for an outcome that we anticipated interest and things like that. So when the case\nsettled, there was about $2 million that was released during Q3 of this year connected to that case.\nJoseph Michael Grabowski\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nOkay. Got it. And then maybe moving on to Material Solutions. You've been talking about dealer\ndestocking for the last few quarters. Maybe how much has dealer destocking been impacting sales\nand orders? And I know you kind of mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but how do you see that\ndestocking playing out over the next few quarters?\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nASTEC INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nYes. We've seen some positive momentum there. Just quarter-over-quarter, we saw about a 4%, 5%\nreduction in dealer inventory. So they continuously doing the destocking. We speak to our dealers\nfrequently.\nJust a couple of weeks ago, we had multiple of our key dealers in place. And they're quite positive about\nnext year. We see strong quoting activity. So it will continue, like we said, for a couple of quarters, but at\nleast we've seen positive momentum in their destocking efforts.\nWe still have a little bit of finished goods inventory. So we have to work through that. They have to work\nthrough their inventory. But looking at our parts business, it's very clear that our customers are running\nour equipment. Quoting activity is good. So we're cautiously optimistic about next year based on the\nfeedback we get from our dealers, Joe.\nJoseph Michael Grabowski\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nGreat. And then last question, maybe just a further expansion on this. You mentioned positive quoting\nactivity in Material Solutions. Do you think that that translates to orders in the fourth quarter? Or is it --\ndoes it maybe shift all the way into the first half of '25?\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nYes. So historically, customers have converted quite a bit of their rental agreements here in the fourth\nquarter. So if we look at historical trends, we are positive about what we're seeing in the fourth quarter.\nI think one of the other things is that over the last 2 or 3 quarters, we've been refocusing the team also\non selling larger systems and not just mobile equipment. And we're really seeing that gaining momentum.\nAnd I think it will balance out a little bit the business that's purely dependent on rental conversions.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Steve Ferazani of Sidoti.\nStephen Michael Ferazani\nSidoti & Company, LLC\nI wanted to ask about the -- I want to ask about the ongoing manufacturing [ efficiencies ]. It sounds like\nyou are taking some efforts to reduce that with some cross-sector use of capacity. Can you talk about\nhow you further eliminate that? Or is that really going to require a pickup on the MS side from a demand\nstandpoint?\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nYes. No, good question, Stephen. I will be honest with you, I'm actually very happy with the work our\nteams have done company-wide. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the teams have done a really\ngood job moving production between facilities and between groups as well.\nMost of this under-absorption or manufacturing efficiencies comes from 1 or 2 sites and the teams are\nworking through that. We are very positive about that side of the business. And the challenge for us is\nhow do we balance cost reductions with what we expect to see from an output point of view next year. We\nwant to retain our people and because we know the sales is out there once we get the output to the level\nthat we expect it to be during next year.\nStephen Michael Ferazani\nSidoti & Company, LLC\nOkay. That's helpful. Given some of the numbers you provided your outlook for 2024, obviously, this was a\nstrong cash flow quarter. Typically, the second half is, but you're guiding for --\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nASTEC INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nYes.\nStephen Michael Ferazani\nSidoti & Company, LLC\n-- a higher CapEx quarter in 4Q. Do you think based on the numbers you provided that you can get close\nto or above breakeven on a cash flow basis this year?\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nYes, for the quarter, we are expecting positive cash flow. Heinrich, maybe you can help on a full year\nbasis.\nHeinrich Jonker\nFormer Interim Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Jaco. I mean, for us, on a full year basis, we continue to focus very much here in Q4 on cash flow\ngeneration. As Jaco mentioned, for us, Q4 typically is a strong quarter from a cash flow perspective as\nwell. Now however, we do have some additional cash outflow that will happen during the Q.\nWe mentioned also about the legal case that we settled. That case -- that cash will flow out during the\nfourth quarter as well for us. But yes, we will continue during Q4 to push very hard on working capital\ndevelopment and focus on receivable and driving inventory down.\nStephen Michael Ferazani\nSidoti & Company, LLC\nGreat. That being said, obviously, your CapEx will be well down from where it was last year. As you start\nbudgeting for next year, I'm assuming you're getting close to maintenance levels. How long can you stay\nat this level of CapEx and still be in a position [indiscernible]?\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nYes. No, good question, Steve. So we still believe that investing in our own operations is a really good use\nof cash. Over the last couple of years, we've built a really strong operational team. And with that comes\nsome great opportunities for us to further improve and automate our manufacturing processes.\nSo CapEx next year will be another strong year. We've also communicated to the market our efforts in\nIndia and establishing manufacturing operations in India. That has been growing significantly. And we will\nprobably invest in some manufacturing capacity over there in the future. So I will say the range for next\nyear will probably be equal to this year.\nStephen Michael Ferazani\nSidoti & Company, LLC\nOkay. That's helpful. You talked about, obviously, concrete and asphalt plant demand has been very\nhealthy throughout. You talked about demand orders running into early 2025. But can you talk about pace\nof orders now? Are you expecting it after such strong growth -- such strong demand over the last couple\nof years, would you expect to see some moderating demand into 2025?\nJaco G. van der Merwe\nCEO, President & Director\nYes. Yes, so a couple of things here. As I mentioned earlier, when we meet with our customers and I\nhave the opportunity to do that on a frequent basis, they have strong backlogs. We've seen strong order\nquoting activity. We have quite a bit of new products that's getting into the market.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nASTEC INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nSo there's a lot of things that gives us cautious optimism for next year, Steve. But obviously, we're early\nin our process and I think we'll give the market a better idea when we talk early Q1 of next year about our\nfull expectations for the year.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to Steve Anderson for closing\nremarks.\nStephen C. Anderson\nSenior VP of Administration, Investor Relations & Corporate Secretary\nAll right. Thank you, Kathleen. We appreciate your participation on our conference call and thank you\nfor your interest in Astec. As today's news release indicates, the conference call has been recorded. A\nreplay of this conference call will be available through November 20, 2024, and an archived webcast will\nbe available for 90 days. The transcript will be available under the Investor Relations section of the Astec\nIndustries website within the next 7 days. All of that information is contained in the news release we\ndistributed this morning.\nSo as we said, this concludes our call. Happy to connect with any of you if you have questions later on. So\nthank you all. Have a good day.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.

(Nasdaq: ASTE) announced today its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"In the third quarter, we had mixed results. In Infrastructure Solutions, both sales and margins were up for the quarter, while in Materials Solutions, we continued to face difficult market conditions. We made nice progress improving our cash flow in the third quarter, which continues to be a key focal point. We were also able to settle one of our previously disclosed, long-standing, legacy litigation matters related to a product we no longer own, which resulted in an $8.4 million charge in the third quarter,\" said Jaco van der Merwe, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMr. van der Merwe continued, \"With sound fundamentals in place, we continue to focus on commercial and operational excellence. We have a customer-focused approach and product offerings to drive sustainable value creation for our shareholders.\"\n\n**GAAP**| **Adjusted**  \n---|---  \n**(in millions, except per share and percentage data)**| **3Q 2024**| **3Q 2023**| **Change**| **3Q 2024**| **3Q 2023**| **Change**  \nNet sales| $| 291.4| $| 303.1| (3.9| )%  \n_Domestic sales_|  _211.2_|  _229.6_|  _(8.0_| )%  \n_International sales_|  _80.2_|  _73.5_|  _9.1_|  _%_  \nBacklog| 475.8| 614.7| (22.6| )%  \n_Domestic backlog_|  _377.6_|  _510.6_|  _(26.0_| )%  \n_International backlog_|  _98.2_|  _104.1_|  _(5.7_| )%  \n(Loss) income from operations| (7.2| )| (5.2| )| (38.5| )%| 9.9| 3.1| 219.4| %  \n_Operating margin_|  _(2.5_| )%| _(1.7_| )%| _(80)_  _bps_|  _3.4_|  _%_| _1.0_|  _%_| _240_ _bps_  \nEffective tax rate| 27.1| %| 8.5| %| 1,860 bps| 18.6| %| 108.3| %| (8,970) bps  \nNet (loss) income attributable to controlling interest| (6.2| )| (6.6| )| 6.1| %| 7.0| (0.2| )| 3600.0| %  \nDiluted EPS| (0.27| )| (0.29| )| 6.9| %| 0.31| (0.01| )| 3200.0| %  \nEBITDA (a non-GAAP measure)| 0.6| 1.8| (66.7| )%| 17.4| 10.0| 74.0| %  \n_EBITDA margin (a non-GAAP measure)_| _0.2_|  _%_| _0.6_|  _%_| _(40)__bps_|  _6.0_|  _%_| _3.3_|  _%_| _270_ _bps_  \n  \n**Segments Results**\n\nOur two reportable segments are comprised of sites based upon the nature of the products or services produced, the type of customer for the products, the similarity of economic characteristics, the manner in which management reviews results and the nature of the production process, among other considerations. Based on a review of these factors, our Australia and LatAm sites, which were previously reported in the Infrastructure Solutions segment have moved to the Materials Solutions segment and Astec Digital, which was previously included in the Corporate and Other category has moved to the Infrastructure Solutions segment, each beginning January 1, 2024. Prior periods have been revised to reflect the changes for the segment composition for comparability.\n\n**_Infrastructure Solutions_** - Road building equipment, asphalt and concrete plants, thermal storage solutions and related aftermarket parts.\n\n  * Net sales of $165.0 million increased slightly as the infrastructure construction market remains strong with healthy demand for asphalt and concrete plant deliveries anticipated through the beginning of 2025.\n  * Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA of $15.6 million increased 17.3% and Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.5% increased 140 basis points.\n  * Backlog was $351.1 million.\n\n\n\n**_Materials Solutions_** - Processing equipment to crush, screen and convey aggregates and related aftermarket parts.\n\n  * Net sales of $126.4 million decreased by 9.6% primarily due to lower equipment sales attributable to finance capacity constraints with contractors and dealers resulting in fewer product conversions. Dealer quoting remains active.\n  * Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA of $14.5 million increased 52.6% and Segment Operating Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5% increased 470 basis points, due to a $6.4 million legal charge in the prior year third quarter, continued efforts towards cost reduction and sharing facility capacity with the Infrastructure Solutions segment.\n  * Backlog was $124.7 million.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity**\n\n  * Our total liquidity was $195.1 million, consisting of $52.7 million of cash and cash equivalents available for operating purposes and $142.4 million available for additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\n  * Free Cash Flow in the quarter was $19.9 million after incurring capital expenditures of $2.6 million.\n\n\n\n**Third****Quarter Capital Allocation**\n\n  * Dividend payment of $0.13 per share.\n\n\n\nI**nvestor Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nAstec will conduct a conference call and live webcast today, November 6, 2024, at 8:30 A.M.

Such statements relate to, among other things, income, earnings, cash flows, changes in operations, operating improvements, businesses in which we operate and the United States and global economies. Statements in this News Release that are not historical are hereby identified as \"forward-looking statements\" and may be indicated by words or phrases such as \"anticipates,\" \"supports,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"expects,\" \"believes,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"forecast,\" \"management is of the opinion,\" use of the future tense and similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements are based largely on management's expectations, which are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed and described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors thereof**,** and in other reports filed subsequently by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which may cause actual results, financial or otherwise, to be materially different from those anticipated, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's results, the Company refers to various U.S. GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) and non-GAAP financial measures which management believes provides useful information to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management of the Company does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Nonetheless, this non-GAAP information can be useful in understanding the Company's operating results and the performance of its core business. Management of the Company uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to establish internal budgets and targets and to evaluate the Company's financial performance against such budgets and targets. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in this News Release.\n\n**For Additional Information Contact:** Steve Anderson Senior Vice President of Administration and Investor RelationsPhone: (423) 899-5898 E-mail: sanderson@astecindustries.com\n\n_Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial information included in this News Release to conform to the presentation used in the financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024._\n\n**Astec Industries Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations****(In millions, except shares in thousands and per share amounts;

We use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to establish internal budgets and targets and to evaluate financial performance against such budgets and targets. We exclude the costs and related tax effects, which are based on the statutory tax rate applicable to each respective item unless otherwise noted below, of the following items as we do not believe they are indicative of our core business operations:\n\n  * Transformation program - Incremental costs related to the execution of our ongoing strategic transformation initiatives which may include personnel costs, third-party consultant costs, duplicative systems usage fees, administrative costs, accelerated depreciation and amortization on certain long-lived assets and other similar type charges. Transformation program initiatives include our multi-year phased implementation of a standardized enterprise resource planning system across the global organization and a lean manufacturing initiative at one of our largest manufacturing sites that was largely completed during 2023 with certain capital investments finalized in early 2024. Transformation program costs for the lean manufacturing initiative ceased at the end of 2023. These costs are included in \"Cost of sales\" and \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\", as appropriate, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n  * Restructuring and other related charges - Charges related to restructuring activities which primarily include personnel termination actions and reorganization efforts to simplify and consolidate our operations. These activities include the workforce reductions effected in the second quarter of 2024, the termination of our previous Chief Executive Officer, the limited overhead restructuring action implemented in February 2023 and ongoing litigation costs for our exited Enid location, including the settlement loss recorded in the third quarter of 2024. These costs are recorded in \"Restructuring, impairment and other asset charges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n  * Goodwill impairment - Goodwill impairment charges, to the extent that they are experienced, are recorded in \"Goodwill impairment\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These charges are associated with the impairment of the goodwill allocated to the Materials Solutions reporting unit during the second quarter of 2024. The goodwill impairment is largely nondeductible for tax purposes and, as such, the tax impact applied reflects the actual tax impact by jurisdiction.\n  * Asset impairment - Asset impairment charges, to the extent that they are experienced, are recorded in \"Restructuring, impairment and other asset charges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These include charges associated with abandoned in-process internally developed software that was determined to be impaired during the second quarter of 2023.\n  * (Loss) gain on sale of property and equipment, net - Gains or losses recognized on the disposal of property and equipment that are recorded in \"Restructuring, impairment and other asset charges, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We may sell or dispose of assets in the normal course of our business operations as they are no longer needed or used.\n\n**Astec Industries Inc.****GAAP vs Non-GAAP Adjusted Income from Operations Reconciliations****(In millions, except percentage data; unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet sales| $| 291.4| $| 303.1| $| 946.1| $| 1,001.0  \n(Loss) income from operations| $| (7.2| )| $| (5.2| )| $| (11.6| )| $| 29.7  \nAdjustments:  \nTransformation program| 8.7| 7.8| 26.4| 22.8  \nRestructuring and other related charges| 8.4| 0.1| 9.4| 7.6  \nGoodwill impairment| —| —| 20.2| —  \nAsset impairment| —| —| —| 0.8  \nLoss (gain) on sale of property and equipment, net| —| 0.4| (1.1| )| (3.1| )  \nAdjusted income from operations| $| 9.9| $| 3.1| $| 43.3| $| 57.8  \nAdjusted operating margin| 3.4| %| 1.0| %| 4.6| %| 5.8| %  \n**Astec Industries Inc.****GAAP vs Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS Reconciliations****(In millions, except per share amounts; unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet (loss) income attributable to controlling interest| $| (6.2| )| $| (6.6| )| $| (16.8| )| $| 18.6  \nAdjustments:  \nTransformation program| 8.7| 7.8| 26.4| 22.8  \nRestructuring and other related charges| 8.4| 0.1| 9.4| 7.6  \nGoodwill impairment| —| —| 20.2| —  \nAsset impairment| —| —| —| 0.8  \nLoss (gain) on sale of property and equipment, net| —| 0.4| (1.1| )| (3.1| )  \nIncome tax impact of adjustments| (3.9| )| (1.9| )| (9.3| )| (6.5| )  \nAdjusted net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest| $| 7.0| $| (0.2| )| $| 28.8| $| 40.2  \nDiluted EPS| $| (0.27| )| $| (0.29| )| $| (0.74| )| $| 0.82  \nAdjustments:  \nTransformation program| 0.38| 0.34| 1.16| 1.00  \nRestructuring and other related charges (a)| 0.37| —| 0.41| 0.34  \nGoodwill impairment| —| —| 0.89| —  \nAsset impairment| —| —| —| 0.04  \nLoss (gain) on sale of property and equipment, net| —| 0.02| (0.05| )| (0.14| )  \nIncome tax impact of adjustments| (0.17| )| (0.08| )| (0.41| )| (0.29| )  \nAdjusted EPS| $| 0.31| $| (0.01| )| $| 1.26| $| 1.77  \n(a) Calculation includes the impact of a rounding adjustment  \n**Astec Industries Inc.****EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliations****(In millions, except percentage data; unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet sales| $| 291.4| $| 303.1| $| 946.1| $| 1,001.0  \nNet (loss) income attributable to controlling interest| $| (6.2| )| $| (6.6| )| $| (16.8| )| $| 18.6  \nInterest expense, net| 2.1| 1.9| 6.9| 4.9  \nDepreciation and amortization| 7.0| 7.1| 20.1| 19.6  \nIncome tax (benefit) provision| (2.3| )| (0.6| )| (0.6| )| 6.5  \nEBITDA| 0.6| 1.8| 9.6| 49.6  \nEBITDA margin| 0.2| %| 0.6| %| 1.0| %| 5.0| %  \nAdjustments:  \nTransformation program| 8.4| 7.7| 25.8| 22.5  \nRestructuring and other related charges| 8.4| 0.1| 9.4| 7.6  \nGoodwill impairment| —| —| 20.2| —  \nAsset impairment| —| —| —| 0.8  \nLoss (gain) on sale of property and equipment, net| —| 0.4| (1.1| )| (3.1| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 17.4| $| 10.0| $| 63.9| $| 77.4  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin| 6.0| %| 3.3| %| 6.8| %| 7.7| %  \n**Astec Industries Inc.****Free Cash Flow Reconciliation****(In millions; unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities| $| 22.5| $| (16.3| )| $| (13.6| )| $| (18.8| )  \nExpenditures for property and equipment| (2.6| )| (7.9| )| (16.0| )| (25.0| )  \nFree cash flow| $| 19.9| $| (24.2| )| $| (29.6| )| $| (43.8| )  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NzkyOCM2NTY2NjEzIzIwMTkwMTQ=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ODMwMDc0YjItZGQ1ZS00MGM5LTllNDktMGY5YmFiZWI0YzEzLTEwMzA1ODc=/tiny/Astec-Industries-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/a7538fd0-56f1-4542-9d12-2061326abadf/small/astec-logo-horiz-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a7538fd0-56f1-4542-9d12-2061326abadf)\n\nSource: Astec Industries, Inc.\n\n[View All News](http://ir.astecindustries.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.
