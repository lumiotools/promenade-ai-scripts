(“Aduro” or the “Company”)\n(NASDAQ: ADUR) (CSE: ACT) (FSE: 9D5), a clean technology company using the power of chemistry to transform\nlower value feedstocks, like waste plastics, heavy bitumen, and renewable oils, into resources for the 21st century, is\npleased to announce its participation at the Advanced Recycling Conference 2024 in Cologne, Germany (“ARC24”\nor the “Conference”).\nEric Appelman, the Company’s Chief Revenue O\u0000cer will present on November 21st, 2024, at 2:30 pm CET. His\npresentation, “An E\u0000ective Alternative to Pyrolysis in Chemical Recycling,” will explore how Aduro’s proprietary\nHydrochemolytic™ technology addresses some longstanding challenges in the chemical recycling of complex and\ncontaminated plastic waste streams. Appelman will present the technology’s unique approach that enables the\nselective breakdown of mixed plastics into valuable, saturated hydrocarbons while removing contaminants in a\nsingle, streamlined process. The HCT process operates at a lower energy mode, has higher tolerance to\ncontaminations and produces a higher yield of higher value products.\nA Solution for the Challenges of Mixed Plastic Waste Recycling\nRecycling mixed plastics often involves a combination of mechanical and chemical methods, with the remaining\nnon-mechanically recyclable portions posing economic and technical challenges. Conventional pyrolysis can be\n1\nenergy-intensive and costly, especially when extensive aftertreatment is needed to remove contaminants and\nstabilize the end product.\nAduro’s Hydrochemolytic™ technology o\u0000ers a promising alternative. Unlike conventional methods, it operates\nwithout the need for molecular hydrogen which in return reduces the negative environmental footprint while also\nreducing capital and operating cost and enabling the ability to build right-sized modular systems. By e\u0000ciently\nbreaking down complex plastic mixtures and selectively removing impurities, this technology reduces post-\ntreatment costs and enables higher-value product streams. This approach not only enhances the economic\nfeasibility of recycling operations but also aligns with the ambitious recycling goals currently set by governments\nand organizations around the world.\nEngage with Aduro at ARC24\nJoin the Aduro team, including Eric Appelman and Stefanie Steenhuis, Head of Brand and Marketing, in the\nExhibition Hall at Booth 22 throughout the conference. Attendees are invited to learn more about Aduro’s advanced\nrecycling solutions, including the latest developments in reactor and process design that further support the\ntechnology’s scalability and commercial readiness.\nAbout the Advanced Recycling Conference\nThe Advanced Recycling Conference (ARC24) convenes industry leaders, researchers, and policymakers to explore\ndiverse recycling technologies, with a focus on chemical recycling. Key discussions will cover life cycle assessment\n(LCA), mass balance, and aligning recycling methods with EU regulations. This year's conference emphasizes\nstrategies for managing complex plastic waste streams to meet the European Union's circularity objectives. Aduro's\ninvolvement highlights its commitment to these pivotal industry dialogues and its role in advancing recycling\ninnovation. www.advanced-recycling.eu\nAbout Aduro Clean Technologies\nAduro Clean Technologies is a developer of patented water-based technologies to chemically recycle waste plastics;\nconvert heavy crude and bitumen into lighter, more valuable oil; and transform renewable oils into higher-value\nfuels or renewable chemicals.

          "content": "NEWS RELEASE\nAduro Clean Technologies and GF Building Flow\nSolutions Americas Sign MOU to Advance Circular\nSolutions for Crosslinked Polyethylene Waste\n2024-11-12\nLONDON, Ontario, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aduro Clean Technologies Inc. (“Aduro” or the “Company”)\n(NASDAQ: ADUR) (CSE: ACT) (FSE: 9D5), a clean technology company using the power of chemistry to transform\nlower value feedstocks, like waste plastics, heavy bitumen, and renewable oils, into resources for the 21st century, is\npleased to announce its entry into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with GF Building Flow Solutions\nAmericas (“GF”), a leader in sustainable building solutions and global provider of Uponor-branded products.\nThis MOU marks an important step as the two companies explore a structured pathway to a formal collaboration\nagreement aimed at enhancing GF’s ongoing e\u0000orts to convert Uponor crosslinked polyethylene (PEX) production\nwaste into valuable raw materials.\nGF Building Flow Solutions Americas is one of the leading international producers of pipes used to move water for\nbuildings and infrastructure, including pipes made of cross-linked polyethylene (PEX). PEX pipes are commonly used\nin energy e\u0000cient heating and safe plumbing due to their robustness, temperature resistance and longevity. The\nengagement between Aduro and GF seeks to demonstrate that chemical recycling through Aduro’s proprietary\nHydrochemolytic™ Technology (HCT) can convert Uponor brand PEX waste into high-quality feedstock, enabling the\nconsecutive manufacturing of products with the same high-quality and properties as in their previous life.\nThis engagement is the result of GF Building Flow Solutions Americas’ continued strategic focus on dealing with its\ncross-linked polyethylene production waste in a sustainable and cost-e\u0000ective way. GF previously participated in\nthe Aduro Customer Engagement Program (CEP) to conduct a phase 1 technical evaluation focused on assessing\n1\nthe potential of HCT for recycling cross-linked polymers. Initial results from this technical evaluation have\ndemonstrated that Aduro’s HCT has the unique ability to break down cross-linked polyethylene to raw material for\nthe manufacture of ethylene.\n“We are very excited to build upon our previous success in breaking down Uponor cross-linked polymer waste into\nraw material,” said Ofer Vicus, CEO of Aduro. “This engagement will expand our relationship with GF Building Flow\nSolutions Americas, setting the stage to develop Aduro’s penetration into the multi-billion-dollar PEX pipe market,\nwith the goal of investigating a potential commercial scale solution for GFs cross-linked polymer waste stream.”\nCross-linked polymers, like those used in Uponor PEX pipes, are pivotal to numerous industries, thanks to their\nexceptional durability, chemical resistance, and mechanical strength. They are integral to many products ranging\nfrom automotive tires to household adhesives, protective coatings, and medical devices. Their critical applications\nspan sectors such as aerospace, automotive, construction, and electronics, where their unique properties are\nindispensable. The global PEX pipe market is expected to reach approximately $2.79 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of\n6.1% (Business Research Insights, October 2024).\nThe attributes that make cross-linked polymers invaluable pose a signi\u0000cant recycling challenge. Unlike\nthermoplastics, these materials do not melt under heat; instead, they are exceedingly di\u0000cult to decompose. When\nsubjected to the very high temperatures necessary for their breakdown, they primarily degrade into char and fuel\ngas, substances unsuitable for repurposing into new materials. This limitation not only underscores the need for\ninnovative recycling technologies but also highlights the urgency of developing sustainable lifecycle management\nstrategies for cross-linked polymers.\n“This engagement with Aduro represents a promising opportunity to demonstrate the importance of partnership in\ninnovating technical capacities and viability of advanced recycling pathways for all industries, including for our PEX\npipe,” said Chrissie Walsh, Sustainability Manager of GF Building Flow Solutions Americas. “We look forward to\ninvestigating the ability of Aduro’s HCT to provide a sustainable and cost-e\u0000ective solution for our cross-linked\npolymer waste stream. We hope to continue building our relationship into a commercial scale solution.”\nAbout GF Building Flow Solutions Americas\nGF Building Flow Solutions Americas, a division of GF, is a leading global provider of sustainable and innovative\nsolutions, making water \u0000ow in buildings. The division, stemming from the 2023 acquisition of Uponor by GF,\nprovides safe solutions for hot and cold-water supply and control, noise-reducing wastewater systems, as well as\nenergy-e\u0000cient heating and cooling.
