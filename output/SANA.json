(NASDAQ: SANA), a company focused on creating and delivering engineered cells as medicines, today reported financial results and business highlights for the third quarter 2024.\n\n“Early clinical data with our hypoimmune technology suggest HIP-modified cells evade immune detection, and we look forward to sharing data in 2024 and 2025 across multiple clinical settings, including type 1 diabetes, B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, and oncology,” said Steve Harr, Sana’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “This past quarter was an important one for the company, as we enhanced our leadership team with the addition of Dhaval Patel as our new Chief Scientific Officer, made progress with our clinical programs, and focused our pipeline. We are optimistic that our recent strategic repositioning to increase focus on immunologic diseases, particularly type 1 diabetes and B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, will help accelerate development and prolong the capital runway for the company. We look forward to multiple clinical data readouts with our current balance sheet with our cash runway into 2026.”\n\nPayments related to ongoing activities combined with the strategic repositioning may increase the 2024 operating cash burn above prior guidance of less than $200 million.\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n**Advancing three clinical programs across five indications, including a gene-modified primary islet cell therapy in type 1 diabetes, an allogeneic CAR T program for B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, and an allogeneic CAR T program for cancer patients that have failed a CD19-targeted therapy:**\n\n  * **Type 1 Diabetes** – UP421 is a primary human HIP-modified pancreatic islet cell therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes. The goal of this investigator-sponsored trial (IST) is to understand immune evasion, islet cell survival, and beta cell function, as measured by C-peptide production, of HIP-modified pancreatic islet cells in type 1 diabetics without any immunosuppression. Sana expects to share initial data in 2024 and/or 2025. Sana is also making progress with the pre-clinical development of SC451, a HIP-modified, stem cell-derived pancreatic islet cell program.\n  * **B-cell Mediated Autoimmune Diseases** – The GLEAM trial evaluates SC291, a HIP-modified CD19-directed allogeneic CAR T therapy, in patients with B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases including lupus nephritis, extrarenal lupus, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. Sana is enrolling patients in this study and expects to share initial data in 2024 and/or 2025.\n  * **Oncology** – The VIVID trial evaluates SC262, a HIP-modified CD22-directed allogeneic CAR T therapy, in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies who have received prior CD19-directed CAR T therapy. Sana is enrolling patients and expects to share data in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Strengthened Research and Development leadership with the appointment of new Chief Scientific Officer**\n\n  * Appointed Dhaval Patel, M.D., Ph.D., as Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Patel has decades of experience in research, drug discovery, drug development, and clinical care – including roles at UCB, Novartis, University of North Carolina, and the Duke University School of Medicine – and over the course of his career has participated in the development of 10 approved drugs in multiple indications.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**GAAP Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were $199.0 million compared to $205.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of $6.2 million was primarily driven by cash used in operations of $176.0 million and cash used for the purchase of property and equipment of $33.0 million, partially offset by net proceeds from equity financings of $181.0 million, proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan of $10.3 million, and net proceeds of $7.8 million from a loan to fund tenant improvements for our manufacturing facility in Bothell, Washington during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n  * **Research and Development Expenses** : For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses, inclusive of non-cash expenses, were $53.2 million and $170.5 million, respectively, compared to $65.6 million and $205.8 million for the same periods in 2023. The decreases of $12.4 million and $35.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily due to lower personnel-related and laboratory costs due to a decrease in headcount and decreased research costs related to the strategic repositioning in the fourth quarter of 2023, lower costs for third-party manufacturing at contract development and manufacturing organizations, and a decline in facility and other allocated costs. These decreases were partially offset by increased clinical development costs. Research and development expenses include non-cash stock-based compensation of $6.5 million and $19.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $5.7 million and $18.4 million, for the same periods in 2023.\n  * **Research and Development Related Success Payments and Contingent Consideration** : For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Sana recognized a non-cash gain of $5.5 million and a non-cash expense of $4.6 million, respectively, in connection with the change in the estimated fair value of the success payment liabilities and contingent consideration in aggregate, compared to non-cash gains of $82.6 million and $55.8 million for the same periods in 2023. The value of these potential liabilities fluctuate significantly with changes in Sana’s market capitalization and stock price.\n  * **General and Administrative Expenses** : General and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, inclusive of non-cash expenses, were $14.1 million and $46.8 million, respectively, compared to $19.2 million and $52.5 million for the same periods in 2023. The decreases of $5.1 million and $5.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily due to a decrease in costs related to Sana’s previously planned manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, a decrease in legal and consulting fees, and lower personnel-related costs due to a decrease in headcount. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation.\n  * **Net Loss** : Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $59.9 million, or $0.25 per share, and $217.7 million, or $0.95 per share, respectively. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.0 million, or $0.00 per share, and net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $195.1 million, or $1.01 per share.\n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\n  * **Non-GAAP Operating Cash Burn** : Non-GAAP operating cash burn for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $153.1 million compared to $187.2 million for the same period in 2023. Non-GAAP operating cash burn is the decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding cash inflows from financing activities, cash outflows from business development, non-recurring items, and the purchase of property and equipment.\n  * **Non-GAAP General and Administrative Expenses** : Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $14.1 million and $46.8 million, respectively, compared to $16.5 million and $49.8 million for the same periods in 2023. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 excludes the loss on termination of the Fremont lease.\n  * **Non-GAAP Net Loss** : Non-GAAP net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $64.7 million, or $0.27 per share, and $208.3 million, or $0.91 per share, respectively, compared to $79.0 million, or $0.41 per share, and $248.3 million, or $1.28 per share, for the same periods in 2023. Non-GAAP net loss excludes non-cash expenses and gains related to the change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration and success payment liabilities, the impairment of other assets, and, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the loss on termination of the Fremont lease.\n\n\n\nA discussion of non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, is presented below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\n**About Sana**\n\nSana Biotechnology, Inc. is focused on creating and delivering engineered cells as medicines for patients.

(Cobalt) and the Presidents and Fellows of Harvard College (Harvard) are entitled to success payments pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective agreements. The success payments are recorded at fair value and remeasured at each reporting period with changes in the estimated fair value recorded in research and development related success payments and contingent consideration on the statement of operations.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Cobalt is entitled to contingent consideration upon the achievement of certain milestones pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement. Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value and remeasured at each reporting period with changes in the estimated fair value recorded in research and development related success payments and contingent consideration on the statement of operations.  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement the financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Sana uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its business. Sana’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful in understanding Sana’s financial performance and potential future results, as well as providing comparability to peer companies and period over period. In particular, Sana’s management utilizes non-GAAP operating cash burn, non-GAAP research and development expense and non-GAAP net loss and net loss per share. Sana believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides management and investors greater visibility into the company’s actual ongoing costs to operate its business, including actual research and development costs unaffected by non-cash valuation changes and certain one-time expenses for acquiring technology, as well as facilitating a more meaningful comparison of period-to-period activity. Sana excludes these items because they are highly variable from period to period and, in respect of the non-cash expenses, provides investors with insight into the actual cash investment in the development of its therapeutic programs and platform technologies.\n\nThese are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with Sana’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures differ from GAAP measures with the same captions, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies, and do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting. Sana’s management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate Sana’s business and make operating decisions. In addition, Sana’s management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because they enhance the ability of investors to compare Sana’s results from period to period and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics Sana uses in making operating decisions. The following are reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures:\n\n****Sana Biotechnology, Inc.****Unaudited Reconciliation of Change in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities to****Non-GAAP Operating Cash Burn****  \n---  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**(in thousands)**  \nBeginning cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities| $| 205,195| $| 434,014  \nEnding cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities| 199,007| 268,570  \nChange in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities| (6,188| )| (165,444| )  \nCash paid to purchase property and equipment| 32,994| 5,986  \nChange in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding capital expenditures| 26,806| (159,458| )  \nAdjustments:  \nNet proceeds from issuance of common stock| (181,000| )| (27,009| )  \nCash paid for personnel-related costs related to portfolio prioritizations| 1,110| 1,881  \nCash paid in connection with the termination of the Fremont lease| -| 4,423  \nCash received in connection with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act| -| (7,063| )  \nOperating cash burn – Non-GAAP| $| (153,084| )| $| (187,226| )  \n  \n****Sana Biotechnology, Inc.****Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP General and Administrative Expense****  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**(in thousands)**  \nGeneral and administrative – GAAP| $| 14,052| $| 19,183| $| 46,763| $| 52,515  \nAdjustments:  \nLoss on termination of Fremont lease(1)| -| (2,668| )| -| (2,668| )  \nGeneral and administrative – Non-GAAP| $| 14,052| $| 16,515| $| 46,763| $| 49,847  \n  \n(1)| For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the loss of $2.7 million included $4.4 million in fees incurred, offset by a gain of $1.7 million recorded in connection with the derecognition of the right-of use asset and lease liability associated with the Fremont Facility.  \n---|---  \n  \n****Sana Biotechnology, Inc.****Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Loss and Net Loss Per Share****  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**(in thousands, except per share data)**  \nNet income (loss) – GAAP| $| (59,924| )| $| 984| $| (217,690| )| $| (195,138| )  \nAdjustments:  \nChange in the estimated fair value of the success payment liabilities(1)| (5,732| )| (24,037| )| 2,316| (8,593| )  \nChange in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration(2)| 235| (58,578| )| 2,250| (47,223| )  \nLoss on termination of Fremont lease(3)| -| 2,668| -| 2,668  \nImpairment of other assets| 763| -| 4,832| -  \nNet loss – Non-GAAP| $| (64,658| )| $| (78,963| )| $| (208,292| )| $| (248,286| )  \nNet income (loss) per share – GAAP| $| (0.25| )| $| -| $| (0.95| )| $| (1.01| )  \nAdjustments:  \nChange in the estimated fair value of the success payment liabilities(1)| (0.02| )| (0.12| )| 0.01| (0.04| )  \nChange in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration(2)| -| (0.30| )| 0.01| (0.24| )  \nLoss on termination of Fremont lease(3)| -| 0.01| -| 0.01  \nImpairment of other assets| -| -| 0.02| -  \nNet loss per share – Non-GAAP| $| (0.27| )| $| (0.41| )| $| (0.91| )| $| (1.28| )  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding – basic| 235,412| 196,978| 229,076| 193,605  \n  \n(1)| For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the gain related to the Cobalt success payment liability was $4.9 million compared to $22.0 million for the same period in 2023.

(NASDAQ: SANA), a company focused on changing the possible for patients through engineered cells, today announced it will prioritize future development activity for SC291, the company’s CD19-directed allogeneic CAR T cell therapy, in B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases (AID). The company will suspend development of both SC291 in oncology and of SC379, its glial progenitor cell program, as it seeks partnerships for these programs. Sana will increase its investment in its type 1 diabetes program with the cash savings from these changes.\n\n“Early clinical data with our hypoimmune platform (HIP) suggest HIP-modified cells evade immune detection, giving us confidence in the potential of the platform across multiple therapeutic areas. At the same time, we need to ensure that we are directing our investments into the areas where we believe we can have the greatest impact for patients,” said Steve Harr, Sana’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Greater focus on type 1 diabetes, SC291 in AID, and SC262 in refractory blood cancers will enhance our ability to present robust clinical data over the next twelve to eighteen months. This modified strategy will also help us reduce our cash burn but comes with the necessity of parting with some talented and valued colleagues. We thank them for their contributions toward building Sana and thank the patients who have been treated in the SC291 oncology study.”\n\nWith these changes, Sana extends its expected cash runway into 2026. Payments related to ongoing activities combined with the reduction in force may increase the 2024 operating cash burn above prior guidance of less than $200 million.\n\n“Since joining Sana, I have actively engaged with the team to understand both Sana and competitor data and believe it is the right time to prioritize where we believe we have the most differentiated therapeutic candidates and the highest probability of success for patients,” said Dhaval Patel, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Sana. “Type 1 diabetes is a significant unmet need, and we are optimistic that our program is novel and has the potential to offer patients meaningful benefit. The decision to prioritize SC291 in B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases is based on early clinical data with this drug in both oncology and autoimmune diseases, which show that therapy with SC291 can predictably lead to the deep B cell depletion that appears to drive an immune “reset” and significant clinical benefit in patients with B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as lupus. We look forward to generating and sharing more data from across our portfolio.”\n\n**Select Program Review**\n\n**UP421 (HIP-modified primary pancreatic islet cells) in type 1 diabetes:** The investigator-sponsored trial exploring the potential of HIP modifications to allogeneic primary islet cells to enable immune evasion and overcome transplant rejection in type 1 diabetes is active; Sana expects to share proof of concept data in 2024 and/or 2025.\n\n**SC291 (HIP-modified CD19-directed allogeneic CAR T) in autoimmune diseases:** Sana continues enrollment in the Phase 1 GLEAM trial for SC291 for the treatment of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases and expects to share clinical data in 2024 and/or 2025.\n\n**SC262 (HIP-modified CD22-directed allogeneic CAR T) in oncology:** Sana continues enrollment in the Phase 1 VIVID study for patients with refractory B-cell malignancies who have failed a previous CD19-directed CAR T therapy and expects to share data in 2025.\n\n**SC451 (HIP-modified stem cell-derived pancreatic islet cells) in type 1 diabetes:** Sana continues preclinical development of this HIP-modified, stem-cell derived therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes.\n\n**SG299 (****_in vivo_****CAR T with CD8-targeted fusogen delivery of a CD19-directed CAR):** Sana is continuing its preclinical development of this program, with potential in both B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases and oncology.\n\n**SC291 (HIP-modified CD19-directed allogeneic CAR T) in oncology** : Given alternative opportunities within its pipeline as well as increased competition within blood cancers and uncertainty about the best path to regulatory and commercial success, Sana is halting enrollment and further internal investment in the Phase 1 ARDENT trial. It is actively seeking a licensing partner to support advancement.\n\n**SC379 (stem-cell derived glial progenitor cells) in various CNS diseases:** Sana will actively seek a partner or opportunity to spin out this program into a new company.\n\n**About Sana Biotechnology** Sana Biotechnology, Inc. is focused on creating and delivering engineered cells as medicines for patients. We share a vision of controlling genes, replacing missing or damaged cells, and making our therapies broadly available to patients. We are a passionate group of people working together to create an enduring company that changes how the world treats disease.
