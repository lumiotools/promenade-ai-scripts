          "content": "Regenerative Biology\nfor Healthier Lives\nInvestor Presentation\nAugust 2024\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this presentation, including the information set forth as to the future financial or operating performance of Biorestorative Therapies, Inc. (the “Company”) that\nare not current or historical factual statements may constitute “forward-looking” information within the meaning of the U.S. federal and state securities laws. When used in\nthis presentation, such statements may include, among other terms, such words as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “target”\nand other similar terminology. These statements reflect current expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events and operating performance and speak only\nas to the date of this presentation. Readers should not place undue importance on forward-looking statements and should not rely upon this information as of any other\ndate.\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements,\nbusiness plan or industry results, to differ materially from our expectations of future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking\nstatements. These forward looking statements may not be realized due to a variety of factors, including without limitation: (i) our limited operating history, lack of significant\nrevenues, and substantial losses since inception;(ii) our ability to obtain sufficient financing to initiate and complete our clinical trials and fund our operations; (iii) our ability\nto timely and successfully develop and commercialize BRTX-100, our lead product candidate for the treatment of chronic lumbar disc disease; (iv) delays in enrolling\npatients in our clinical trials; (v) disruption to our access to the media (including cell culture media) and reagents the Company is using in the clinical development of our\ncell therapy product candidates; (vi) failure of our clinical trials to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of our product candidates; (vii) our lack of\nmanufacturing capabilities to produce our product candidates at commercial scale quantities and lack of an alternative manufacturing supply; (viii) a loss of our exclusive\nlicense rights with regard to our disc/spine technology; (ix) safety problems encountered by us or others developing new stem cell-based therapies; (x) ethical and other\nconcerns surrounding the use of stem cell therapy which negatively impact the public perception of our stem cell products and/or services; (xi) our limited experience in\nthe development and marketing of cell therapies; (xii) our reliance on novel technologies that are inherently expensive and risky; (xiii) significant product liability claims and\nlitigation to which the company may be subject, including potential exposure from the use of our product candidates in human subjects; (xiv) our inability to obtain\nreimbursement for our products and services from private and governmental insurers; (xv) our inability to protect our proprietary rights; and (xvi) compliance with\napplicable federal, state, local, and international requirements. See also “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – factors\nthat may affect future results and financial condition” set forth in the Company’s most recent annual report filed with the SEC.\nMany of these issues can affect the Company’s actual results and could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking\nstatements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. You are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not\nplace reliance on them. In formulating the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation, it has been assumed that business and economic conditions\naffecting the Company and the economy generally will continue substantially in the ordinary course. These assumptions, although considered reasonable at the time of\npreparation, may prove to be incorrect.\nThe description of the Company and its business in this presentation does not purport to be complete and is subject to the more detailed description of the Company and\nits business in the Company’s annual, quarterly and current reports filed with the SEC.\n2\nFully Integrated Regenerative Medicine Company\nDEVELOPMENT COMMERCIAL\nThermoStem BRTX-100 BioCosmeceuticals\nSecretome (novel exosome,\nBrown adipose derived Bone marrow derived\ngrowth factor/cytokine)\nstem cells mesenchymal stem cells\nbiologics based technology\nfor cosmetic applications\nPRECLINICAL MID-STAGE CLINICAL\n3\nExperienced Leadership\nLance Alstodt Robert Kristal\nChairman & CEO Chief Financial Officer\n• 30+ years leading, advising and operating companies within the • 25+ years on Bay Street and Wall Street\nHealthcare sector\n• Most recently was the DOR for a Healthcare focused Investment Bank\n• Founder of MedVest Capital, a Healthcare fund created in 2013\n• Career has spanned Trading, Sales, Investment Banking and Research\n• Prior to that led the Medical Technology investment banking group at\nBank of America Merrill Lynch and Leerink Partners\nFrancisco Silva Bob Paccasassi\nVice President of R&D Vice President of Quality\n• 20+ years in the R&D of cell-based and off-the-shelf therapeutics • 25+ years of biotech operations and combined experience in Quality\nAssurance, Regulatory, and Manufacturing (QRM)\n• As BRTX’s Vice President R&D, established high throughput Stem Cell\nResearch Program based on his academic and industrial research • Previous QRM management positions at Regeneron, Millennium, and\nexperience Merck\n• Has obtained several patents in cell therapy, and has manuscripts • Recently named Regenerative Medicine Section Editor of the\npublished with regards to translational stem cell research prestigious Journal of Translational Medicine\n4\nDEVELOPMENT COMMERCIAL\nThermoStem BRTX-100 BioCosmeceuticals\nSecretome (novel exosome,\nBrown adipose derived Bone marrow derived\ngrowth factor/cytokine)\nstem cells mesenchymal stem cells\nbiologics based technology\nfor cosmetic applications\nPRECLINICAL MID-STAGE CLINICAL\n5\nGoing Commercial: Biologics Based Cosmetic Products\nThe Market\n•\nGlobal Cosmetic market $63 B and growing\n•\nGlobal injectable market 12% CAGR 2021-2026 Est $11.9 B\n•\nDerms need differentiated product\n•\nBundle with current procedures\nKey Features of\nCosmetics &\nManufacturing\nHair Growth •\ncGMP ISO 7 Certified Facility\n•\nBiologics Products Cellular Biology Engineering Expertise\n•\nMulti use facility highlights versatility\nProducts\n•\nCell based biologics engineered and\ntargeted for both clinical and aesthetic use\n•\nExclusive 5-year commercial agreement\nwith Cartessa Aesthetics\n6\nDEVELOPMENT COMMERCIAL\nThermoStem BRTX-100 BioCosmeceuticals\nSecretome (novel exosome,\nBrown adipose derived Bone marrow derived\ngrowth factor/cytokine)\nstem cells mesenchymal stem cells\nbiologics based technology\nPRECLINICAL CLINICAL for cosmetic applications\n7\nRobust Preclinical & Clinical Pipeline\nPRECLINICAL PHASE 1 PHASE 2 PHASE 3\nLumbar\nSpine Cervical\nThoracic\nHips/Knees\nMusculoskeletal\nExtremities\nSystem\nAvascular Zones\nType 2 Diabetes\nMetabolic Obesity\nPCOS\nARDS\nBrown Adipose\nStem Cells\nLong Hauler Covid\nSecretome / Exosome Cosmetic\n8 * Polycystic ovarian syndrome\nSUOGOLOTUA\nCIENEGOLLA\nCOMMERCIAL\nPhase 2 IND\nSUBMITTED\nChronic Lumbar Disc Disease (cLDD)\n258 M U.S. adult population\nAmerican adults with chronic\n64.5 M\nlower back pain prevalence\nAmerican adults with diagnosed\n32 M\nand treated disc degeneration\nAmericans suffering pain caused\n15 M\nby a protruding or injured disc\nInvasive Surgical Procedures per\n2.5 M\nyear $40 billion in surgeries\n9 * Trinity Partners Report, “Degenerative Disc Disease US Market Assessment (Phase I),” Feb. 2016, Slide 9 of report.\nThe Problem: Clinical & Economic\nConservative Surgical\nTreatments Treatments\nORAL MEDICATION TREATMENT\nSPINAL FUSION SURGERY\n/ OPIOIDS\n$110,000\n$1,000 -
