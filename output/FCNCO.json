(\"BancShares\") (Nasdaq: FCNCA) reported earnings for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n[ ![First Citizens BancShares \\(PRNewsfoto/CIT Group Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1719150/First_Citizens_BancShares__Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1719150/First_Citizens_BancShares__Logo.html)\n\nChairman and CEO Frank B. Holding, Jr. said: \"We posted another quarter of strong financial results, largely in line with our expectations. Loan growth remained resilient in both the General Bank and Commercial Bank segments, while loans in the SVB Commercial segment declined as Global Fund Banking repayment levels outpaced draw activity. We experienced another quarter of deposit growth, mostly concentrated in our Branch Network, with modest deposit growth in SVB Commercial. The stability of the SVB deposit franchise continues to demonstrate the competitive advantage we maintain in the innovation economy. Credit remained stable and our capital and liquidity positions remained strong. During the third quarter, we repurchased more than 350,000 shares of our Class A common shares for $700 million under the repurchase plan announced in July.\n\n\"In the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, our thoughts continue to be with our associates, clients and communities across the Southeast affected by these devastating natural disasters. Our associates responded to these events with resilience, perseverance and determination, allowing us to quickly reopen operations to help our clients and communities in their rebuilding efforts. We are committed to continuing this support moving forward.\"\n\n**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\nMeasures referenced \"as adjusted\" below, as well as net interest income and net interest margin, excluding purchase accounting accretion (\"PAA\"), are non-GAAP financial measures (refer to the Financial Supplement available at [ir.firstcitizens.com](http://ir.firstcitizens.com) or [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov) for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure).\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 (\"current quarter\") was $639 million compared to $707 million for the second quarter of 2024 (\"linked quarter\"). Net income available to common stockholders for the current quarter was $624 million, or $43.42 per diluted common share, a $67 million decrease from $691 million, or $47.54 per diluted common share, in the linked quarter.\n\nAdjusted net income for the current quarter was $675 million compared to $755 million for the linked quarter. Adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $660 million, or $45.87 per diluted common share, a $79 million decrease from $739 million, or $50.87 per diluted common share, in the linked quarter.\n\nCurrent quarter results were primarily impacted by the following notable items to arrive at adjusted net income available to common stockholders:\n\n  * Acquisition-related expenses of $46 million,\n  * Intangible asset amortization of $15 million,\n  * Favorable fair value adjustment on marketable equity securities of $9 million,\n  * Realized gain on sales of marketable equity securities of $4 million,\n  * Gain on sale of leasing equipment of $5 million,\n  * Other noninterest expense of $8 million, and\n  * Net impact of $15 million for the tax effect of notable items.\n\n\n\n**NET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN**\n\n  * Net interest income totaled $1.80 billion for the current quarter, a decrease of $25 million from the linked quarter. Net interest income related to PAA was $101 million compared to $140 million in the linked quarter, a decrease of $39 million. Net interest income, excluding PAA, was $1.70 billion compared to $1.68 billion in the linked quarter, an increase of $14 million.\n  * The decrease in net interest income was due to a $33 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by an $8 million increase in interest income.\n  * The increase of $8 million in interest income was due to increases in interest on investment securities and loans of $28 million and $8 million, respectively, which were partially offset by a $28 million decrease in interest on interest-earning deposits at banks.\n    * Higher average balances led to a $46 million increase in loan interest income, which was partially offset by a $38 million decrease in loan PAA income, resulting in an $8 million increase in loan interest income compared to the linked quarter.\n    * Continued purchases of short duration investment securities increased the average balance and interest income for investment securities and decreased the average balance and interest income for interest-earning deposits at banks.\n  * The $33 million increase in interest expense was mostly due to a $29 million increase in interest expense on deposits, primarily related to growth in money market deposits in the Branch Network and savings deposits in the Direct Bank, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of time deposits.\n  * Net interest margin was 3.53% compared to 3.64% in the linked quarter. Net interest margin, excluding PAA, was 3.33% compared to 3.36% in the linked quarter. \n    * The yield on average interest-earning assets was 6.18%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the linked quarter, primarily due to decreases in the yield on interest-earning deposits at banks and loan accretion, partially offset by a higher yield on investment securities.\n    * The rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 3 basis points from the linked quarter, primarily due to a higher average rate paid on money market deposits, partially offset by lower average rates paid on all other interest-bearing deposits. While the rate paid on average money market deposits increased compared to the linked quarter, it declined late in the current quarter.\n\n\n\n**NONINTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE**\n\n  * Noninterest income totaled $650 million, an increase of $11 million compared to the linked quarter. Noninterest income in the current quarter included a realized gain of $4 million on the sale of marketable equity securities and an $11 million favorable fair value adjustment on marketable equity securities relative to the linked quarter.\n  * Adjusted noninterest income was $474 million compared to $479 million in the linked quarter, a decrease of $5 million. The decrease in adjusted noninterest income was a result of an $18 million decline in other noninterest income, mainly attributable to fair value changes in customer derivative positions and other nonmarketable investments, partially offset by increases of $4 million in fee income and other service charges, $3 million in adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment, and $6 million spread among various noninterest income line items.\n  * Noninterest expense was $1.46 billion compared to $1.39 billion in the linked quarter, an increase of $70 million. Salaries and benefits increased $43 million, mainly attributable to an additional working day in the current quarter, net staff additions, increases in incentive accruals and temporary labor associated with technology projects. Professional fees increased $18 million, mostly related to continued enhancements to our large financial institution regulatory compliance capabilities. The remaining increase of $9 million was spread among various noninterest expense line items.\n  * Adjusted noninterest expense was $1.23 billion compared to $1.17 billion in the linked quarter, an increase of $61 million, mostly related to the previously discussed increases in salaries and benefits and professional fees.\n\n\n\n**BALANCE SHEET SUMMARY**\n\n  * Loans and leases totaled $138.70 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $646 million (0.5% linked quarter decline) compared to $139.34 billion at June 30, 2024 as the decrease in the SVB Commercial segment was partially offset by loan growth in the General Bank and Commercial Bank segments.\n    * The decrease in the SVB Commercial segment of $2.12 billion (5.0% linked quarter decline) was primarily due to declines in Global Fund Banking as repayment levels outpaced draw activity on new lines of credit.\n    * Loan growth in the General Bank segment of $897 million (1.4% linked quarter growth) was primarily related to commercial and business loans in the Branch Network.\n    * Loan growth of $573 million (1.8% linked quarter growth) in the Commercial Bank segment was primarily due to growth in the Tech Media and Telecom and Healthcare verticals.\n  * Total investment securities were $38.66 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $997 million since June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly attributable to purchases of approximately $2.58 billion short duration U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency mortgage-backed investment securities available for sale during the current quarter, partially offset by paydowns and maturities.\n  * Deposits totaled $151.57 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $495 million since June 30, 2024 (0.3% linked quarter growth). The increase was mostly due to growth in the General Bank and SVB Commercial segments, which was partially offset by declines in the Commercial Bank segment and the Direct Bank.\n    * Deposit growth in the General Bank segment of $690 million was primarily due to money market deposits in the Branch Network.\n    * Deposit growth in the SVB Commercial segment of $54 million was primarily due to an increase in money market deposits, partially offset by declines in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking.\n    * Deposits in the Commercial Bank segment decreased by $204 million as declines in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking were partially offset by growth in money market deposits.\n    * Corporate deposits, which includes the Direct Bank, declined by $49 million, mostly due to a decline in time deposits, partially offset by growth in savings deposits.\n  * Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 26.0% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024, compared to 26.5% at June 30, 2024. The cost of average total deposits was 2.64% for the current quarter, compared to 2.61% for the linked quarter. While the cost of average total deposits increased 3 basis points from the linked quarter, the pace slowed relative to the 8 basis point increase in the linked quarter compared to the first quarter of 2024.\n  * Funding mix remained stable with 80.3% of the total funding composed of deposits.\n\n\n\n**PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND CREDIT QUALITY**\n\n  * Provision for credit losses totaled $117 million for the current quarter compared to $95 million for the linked quarter, an increase of $22 million. The current quarter provision for credit losses included a loan and lease loss provision of $123 million, partially offset by a benefit for off-balance sheet credit exposure of $6 million.\n    * The provision for loan and lease losses of $123 million increased $28 million compared to the linked quarter, mainly attributable to an increase in net charge-offs of $13 million, changes in the macroeconomic forecast, higher specific reserves, and an estimate of $20 million related to Hurricane Helene.\n  * Net charge-offs totaled $145 million for the current quarter, representing 0.42% of average loans, compared to $132 million, or 0.38% of average loans, for the linked quarter. The $13 million increase in net charge-offs was mainly related to the Real Estate Finance and Equipment Finance portfolios in the Commercial Bank segment.\n  * Nonaccrual loans were $1.24 billion, or 0.90% of loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.14 billion, or 0.82% of loans, at June 30, 2024. The increase in nonaccrual loans was concentrated in the SVB Commercial segment.\n  * The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $1.68 billion, or 1.21% of loans, at September 30, 2024, down from 1.22% at June 30, 2024. The net decline in the allowance ratio reflected a reserve release of $22 million for the current quarter, compared to a $37 million reserve release in the linked quarter. The $22 million reserve release in the current quarter was primarily due to changes in credit quality and lower loan balances, partially offset by changes in the macroeconomic forecast, higher specific reserves, and the estimate related to Hurricane Helene.\n\n\n\n**CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY**\n\n  * Capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements. The estimated total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios were 15.36%, 13.78%, 13.24%, and 10.20%, respectively, at September 30, 2024.\n  * During the current quarter, we repurchased 353,058 of our Class A common shares for $700 million and paid a dividend of $1.64 per share on our Class A and Class B common stock. Shares repurchased during the current quarter represented 2.61% of Class A common shares and 2.43% of total Class A and Class B common shares outstanding at June 30, 2024.\n  * Liquidity position remains strong as liquid assets were $58.36 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $56.91 billion at June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**EARNINGS CALL/ WEBCAST DETAILS**\n\nBancShares will host a conference call to discuss the company's financial results on Thursday, October 24, 2024, at 9 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe call may be accessed via webcast on the company's website at [ir.firstcitizens.com](http://ir.firstcitizens.com) or through the dial-in details below:\n\nNorth America: 1-833-470-1428All other locations: 1-929-526-1599Access code: 970671\n\nOur earnings release, investor presentation, and financial supplement are available at [ir.firstcitizens.com](http://ir.firstcitizens.com).

Words such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"predicts,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"targets,\" \"designed,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"aims\" or other similar words and expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on BancShares' current expectations and assumptions regarding BancShares' business, the economy, and other future conditions.\n\nBecause forward-looking statements relate to future results and occurrences, they are subject to inherent risks, uncertainties, changes in circumstances and other factors that are difficult to predict. Many possible events or factors could affect BancShares' future financial results and performance and could cause actual results, performance or achievements of BancShares to differ materially from any anticipated results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, general competitive, economic, political (including the upcoming U.S. election), geopolitical events (including conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East) and market conditions, including changes in competitive pressures among financial institutions and the impacts related to or resulting from recent bank failures, the risks and impacts of future bank failures and other volatility in the banking industry, public perceptions of our business practices, including our deposit pricing and acquisition activity, the financial success or changing conditions or strategies of BancShares' vendors or customers, including changes in demand for deposits, loans and other financial services, fluctuations in interest rates, changes in the quality or composition of BancShares' loan or investment portfolio, actions of government regulators, including the recent interest rate cut and any changes by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (the \"Federal Reserve\"), changes to estimates of future costs and benefits of actions taken by BancShares, BancShares' ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity, the potential impact of decisions by the Federal Reserve on BancShares' capital plans, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions, including significant turbulence in the capital or financial markets, the impact of any sustained or elevated inflationary environment, the impact of any cyberattack, information or security breach, the impact of implementation and compliance with current or proposed laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including potential increased regulatory requirements, limitations, and costs, such as FDIC special assessments, increases to FDIC deposit insurance premiums and the proposed interagency rule on regulatory capital, along with the risk that such laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations may change, the availability of capital and personnel, and the risks associated with BancShares' previous acquisition transactions, including the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. and the previously completed transaction with CIT Group Inc., or any future transactions.\n\nBancShares' share repurchase program allows BancShares to repurchase shares of its Class A common stock through 2025. BancShares is not obligated under the share repurchase program to repurchase any minimum or particular number of shares, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time (subject to the terms of any Rule 10b5-1 plan in effect) without prior notice. The authorization to repurchase Class A common stock will be utilized at management's discretion. The actual timing and amount of Class A common stock that may be repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the terms of any Rule 10b5-1 plan then in effect, price, general business and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and alternative investment opportunities or capital needs.\n\nExcept to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations, BancShares disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments. Additional factors which could affect the forward-looking statements can be found in BancShares' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and its other filings with the SEC.\n\n**NON-GAAP MEASURES**\n\nCertain measures in this release, including those referenced as \"adjusted,\" as well as net interest income and net interest margin, excluding PAA, are \"non-GAAP,\" meaning they are numerical measures of BancShares' financial performance, financial position or cash flows that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") because they exclude or include amounts or are adjusted in some way so as to be different than the most direct comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in BancShares' statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows and also are not codified in U.S. banking regulations currently applicable to BancShares. BancShares management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial information, can provide transparency about or an alternative means of assessing its operating results, financial position or cash flows to its investors, analysts and management. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or a substitute for, GAAP measures. Each non-GAAP measure is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure in the non-GAAP reconciliation.

(\"BancShares\") (Nasdaq: FCNCA) reported earnings for the second quarter of 2024 and announced a share repurchase plan.\n\nChairman and CEO Frank B. Holding, Jr. said: \"We are pleased with our second quarter financial results, which reflected broad-based loan and deposit growth, strong profitability metrics and continued stabilization of credit. These results reflected the solid performance from all of our business segments and we were encouraged by the continued progress in our SVB Commercial segment, which achieved both loan and deposit growth. In addition, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to $3.5 billion of our Class A common shares, with repurchases expected to begin during the third quarter of 2024.\" \n\n**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\nMeasures referenced as adjusted below and net interest margin, excluding purchase accounting accretion, are non-GAAP financial measures (refer to the Financial Supplement available at [ir.firstcitizens.com](http://ir.firstcitizens.com) or [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov) for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure).\n\nNet income for the second quarter of 2024 (\"current quarter\") was $707 million compared to $731 million for the first quarter of 2024 (\"linked quarter\"). Net income available to common stockholders for the current quarter was $691 million, or $47.54 per diluted common share, a $25 million decrease from $716 million, or $49.26 per diluted common share, in the linked quarter.\n\nAdjusted net income for the current quarter was $755 million compared to $784 million for the linked quarter. Adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $739 million, or $50.87 per diluted common share, a $30 million decrease from $769 million, or $52.92 per diluted common share, in the linked quarter.\n\nCurrent quarter results were primarily impacted by the following notable items to arrive at adjusted net income available to common stockholders:\n\n  * Acquisition-related expenses of $44 million,\n  * Intangible asset amortization of $15 million,\n  * Gain on sale of leasing equipment of $4 million,\n  * Unfavorable fair value adjustment on marketable equity securities of $2 million, and\n  * Net impact of $10 million for the tax effect of notable items.\n\n\n\n**NET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN**\n\n  * Net interest income totaled $1.82 billion for the current quarter, an increase of $4 million over the linked quarter. The increase was due to a $46 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $42 million increase in interest expense.\n  * The increase in interest income was due to increases in interest on loans and investment securities of $68 million and $48 million, respectively, which were partially offset by a $70 million decrease in interest on interest-earning deposits at banks.\n    * Loan growth and a higher yield led to an $86 million increase in loan interest income, which was partially offset by an $18 million decrease in loan accretion income, primarily related to the acquisition of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. (the \"SVBB Acquisition\").\n    * Continued purchases of short duration investment securities increased the average balance and interest income for investment securities and decreased the average balance and interest income for interest-earning deposits at banks.\n  * Growth in interest-bearing deposits in the General Bank and SVB Commercial segments and a higher average rate paid led to a $47 million increase in interest expense on deposits, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in borrowing costs.\n  * Net interest margin was 3.64% compared to 3.67% in the linked quarter. Net interest margin, excluding purchase accounting accretion, was 3.36% compared to 3.35% in the linked quarter.\n    * The yield on average interest-earning assets was 6.26%, an increase of 3 basis points from the linked quarter, primarily due to higher average balances and yields on investment securities and loans, partially offset by lower average balances of interest-earning deposits at banks and lower loan accretion.\n    * The rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 5 basis points from the linked quarter, primarily due to higher average balances and rates paid for interest-bearing deposits. While the rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 9 basis points from the linked quarter, the pace slowed relative to the linked quarter when the rate paid increased 17 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**NONINTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE**\n\n  * Noninterest income totaled $639 million, an increase of $12 million compared to the linked quarter. Client investment fees increased by $4 million, which was related to higher average off-balance sheet client funds in the SVB Commercial segment. The remaining increases in noninterest income were spread across various items, including a $2 million improvement from the linked quarter for the fair value adjustment on marketable equity securities and a $2 million loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in the linked quarter.\n  * Adjusted noninterest income was $479 million compared to $478 million in the linked quarter, an increase of $1 million. The previously discussed increases in noninterest income were offset by a decline of $13 million in adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment, primarily related to higher maintenance and other operating lease expenses.\n  * Noninterest expense was $1.39 billion compared to $1.38 billion for the linked quarter, an increase of $10 million. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of $15 million for maintenance and other operating lease expenses and $12 million for equipment expense, which were partially offset by a decrease of $14 million in acquisition-related expenses.\n  * Adjusted noninterest expense was $1.17 billion compared to $1.15 billion in the linked quarter. The increase of $14 million was mainly due to higher equipment expense related to increased software maintenance and rent.\n\n\n\n**BALANCE SHEET SUMMARY**\n\n  * Loans and leases totaled $139.34 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $3.97 billion (2.9% linked quarter growth) compared to $135.37 billion at March 31, 2024.\n    * Loan growth in the SVB Commercial segment of $2.12 billion (5.3% linked quarter growth) was concentrated in the global fund banking portfolio.\n    * Loan growth in the General Bank segment of $1.46 billion (2.3% linked quarter growth) was primarily related to commercial and business loans in the Branch Network.\n    * Loan growth of $386 million (1.2% linked quarter growth) in the Commercial Bank segment was due to several industry verticals, primarily Tech Media and Telecom and Healthcare.\n  * Total investment securities were $37.67 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $2.62 billion since March 31, 2024. The increase was due to purchases of approximately $4.88 billion, primarily in short duration U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency mortgage-backed investment securities available for sale during the current quarter, partially offset by paydowns and maturities.\n  * Deposits totaled $151.08 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $1.47 billion, or 4.0% on an annualized basis, since March 31, 2024. The increase was mostly due to growth in the SVB Commercial and General Bank segments, which was partially offset by declines in brokered deposits and Direct Bank deposits in Corporate.\n    * Deposit growth in the SVB Commercial segment of $1.88 billion was mainly due to slight improvement in the macroeconomic environment and increases in client acquisitions.\n    * Deposit growth in the General Bank segment of $329 million was primarily due to growth in the Branch Network.\n    * Corporate deposits decreased $667 million, primarily due to a decline of $532 million in brokered deposits. Direct Bank deposits decreased by $145 million as the decline in time deposits was partially offset by growth in savings deposits.\n  * Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 26.5% of total deposits as of June 30, 2024, compared to 26.3% at March 31, 2024. The cost of average total deposits was 2.61% for the current quarter, compared to 2.53% for the linked quarter. While the cost of average total deposits increased 8 basis points from the linked quarter, the pace slowed relative to the 18 basis point increase in the linked quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\n  * Funding mix remained stable with 80.1% of the total funding composed of deposits.\n\n\n\n**PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND CREDIT QUALITY**\n\n  * Provision for credit losses, which includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the benefit for off-balance sheet credit exposure, was $95 million compared to $64 million for the linked quarter. The $31 million increase was mainly related to a $29 million lower benefit for off balance sheet credit exposure as the pace of decline for unfunded commitment volumes slowed relative to the linked quarter.\n  * Net charge-offs totaled $132 million for the current quarter, representing 0.38% of average loans, compared to $103 million, or 0.31% of average loans, for the linked quarter. The $29 million increase in net charge-offs was mainly related to Equipment Finance and Investor Dependent loans.\n  * Nonaccrual loans were $1.14 billion, or 0.82% of loans, at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.07 billion, or 0.79% of loans, at March 31, 2024.\n  * The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $1.70 billion, or 1.22% of total loans at June 30, 2024, reflecting a reserve release of $37 million for the current quarter, compared to a $10 million reserve release for the linked quarter. The reserve release for the current quarter was primarily the result of a mix shift to the Global Fund Banking portfolio, which has lower loss rates relative to our other loan portfolios, lower specific reserves for individually evaluated loans, stable credit quality, and changes in the macroeconomic forecast.\n\n\n\n**CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY**\n\n  * Capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements. The estimated total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios were 15.45%, 13.87%, 13.33%, and 10.29%, respectively, at June 30, 2024.\n  * During the current quarter, a dividend of $1.64 per share of common stock was declared and paid.\n  * Liquidity position remains strong as liquid assets were $56.91 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $59.33 billion at March 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n**EARNINGS CALL/ WEBCAST DETAILS**\n\nBancShares will host a conference call to discuss the company's financial results on Thursday, July 25, 2024, at 9 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe call may be accessed via webcast on the company's website at [ir.firstcitizens.com](http://ir.firstcitizens.com) or through the dial-in details below:\n\nNorth America: 1-833-470-1428All other locations: 1-929-526-1599Access code: 930922\n\nOur earnings release, investor presentation, and financial supplement are available at [ir.firstcitizens.com](http://ir.firstcitizens.com).

Words such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"predicts,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"targets,\" \"designed,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"aims\" or other similar words and expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on BancShares' current expectations and assumptions regarding BancShares' business, the economy, and other future conditions.\n\nBecause forward-looking statements relate to future results and occurrences, they are subject to inherent risks, uncertainties, changes in circumstances and other factors that are difficult to predict. Many possible events or factors could affect BancShares' future financial results and performance and could cause actual results, performance or achievements of BancShares to differ materially from any anticipated results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, general competitive, economic, political (including the upcoming U.S. election), geopolitical events (including conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East) and market conditions, including changes in competitive pressures among financial institutions and the impacts related to or resulting from recent bank failures, the risks and impacts of future bank failures and other volatility in the banking industry, public perceptions of our business practices, including our deposit pricing and acquisition activity, the financial success or changing conditions or strategies of BancShares' vendors or customers, including changes in demand for deposits, loans and other financial services, fluctuations in interest rates, changes in the quality or composition of BancShares' loan or investment portfolio, actions of government regulators, including recent interest rate hikes and any changes by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (the \"Federal Reserve\"), changes to estimates of future costs and benefits of actions taken by BancShares, BancShares' ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity, the potential impact of decisions by the Federal Reserve on BancShares' capital plans, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions, including significant turbulence in the capital or financial markets, the impact of any sustained or elevated inflationary environment, the impact of any cyberattack, information or security breach, the impact of implementation and compliance with current or proposed laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including potential increased regulatory requirements, limitations, and costs, such as FDIC special assessments, increases to FDIC deposit insurance premiums and the recently proposed interagency rule on regulatory capital, along with the risk that such laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations may change, the availability of capital and personnel, and the risks associated with BancShares' previous acquisition transactions, including the SVBB Acquisition and the previously completed transaction with CIT Group Inc., or any future transactions.\n\nBancShares' share repurchase program allows BancShares to repurchase shares of its Class A common stock through 2025. BancShares is not obligated under the share repurchase program to repurchase any minimum or particular number of shares, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time (subject to the terms of any Rule 10b5-1 plan in effect) without prior notice. The authorization to repurchase Class A common stock will be utilized at management's discretion. The actual timing and amount of Class A common stock that may be repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the terms of any Rule 10b5-1 plan then in effect, price, general business and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and alternative investment opportunities or capital needs.\n\nExcept to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations, BancShares disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments. Additional factors which could affect the forward-looking statements can be found in BancShares' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and its other filings with the SEC.\n\n**NON-GAAP MEASURES**\n\nCertain measures in this release, including those referenced as \"adjusted\", are \"non-GAAP,\" meaning they are numerical measures of BancShares' financial performance, financial position or cash flows that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") because they exclude or include amounts or are adjusted in some way so as to be different than the most direct comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in BancShares' statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows and also are not codified in U.S. banking regulations currently applicable to BancShares. BancShares management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial information, can provide transparency about or an alternative means of assessing its operating results, financial position or cash flows to its investors, analysts and management. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or a substitute for, GAAP measures. Each non-GAAP measure is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure in the non-GAAP reconciliation.

(“BancShares”) (Nasdaq: FCNCA) reported earnings for the\nthird quarter of 2024.\nChairman and CEO Frank B. Holding, Jr. said: “We posted another quarter of strong financial results, largely in line\nwith our expectations. Loan growth remained resilient in both the General Bank and Commercial Bank segments,\nwhile loans in the SVB Commercial segment declined as Global Fund Banking repayment levels outpaced draw\nactivity. We experienced another quarter of deposit growth, mostly concentrated in our Branch Network, with\nmodest deposit growth in SVB Commercial. The stability of the SVB deposit franchise continues to demonstrate the\ncompetitive advantage we maintain in the innovation economy. Credit remained stable and our capital and liquidity\npositions remained strong. During the third quarter, we repurchased more than 350,000 shares of our Class A\ncommon shares for $700 million under the repurchase plan announced in July.\n“In the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, our thoughts continue to be with our associates, clients and\ncommunities across the Southeast affected by these devastating natural disasters. Our associates responded to these\nevents with resilience, perseverance and determination, allowing us to quickly reopen operations to help our clients\nand communities in their rebuilding efforts. We are committed to continuing this support moving forward.”\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nMeasures referenced “as adjusted” below, as well as net interest income and net interest margin, excluding purchase\naccounting accretion (“PAA”), are non-GAAP financial measures (refer to the Financial Supplement available at\nir.firstcitizens.com or www.sec.gov for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable\nGAAP measure).\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 (“current quarter”) was $639 million compared to $707 million for the\nsecond quarter of 2024 (“linked quarter”). Net income available to common stockholders for the current quarter was\n$624 million, or $43.42 per diluted common share, a $67 million decrease from $691 million, or $47.54 per diluted\ncommon share, in the linked quarter.\nAdjusted net income for the current quarter was $675 million compared to $755 million for the linked quarter.\nAdjusted net income available to common stockholders was $660 million, or $45.87 per diluted common share, a\n$79 million decrease from $739 million, or $50.87 per diluted common share, in the linked quarter.\nCurrent quarter results were primarily impacted by the following notable items to arrive at adjusted net income\navailable to common stockholders:\n• Acquisition-related expenses of $46 million,\n• Intangible asset amortization of $15 million,\n• Favorable fair value adjustment on marketable equity securities of $9 million,\n• Realized gain on sales of marketable equity securities of $4 million,\n• Gain on sale of leasing equipment of $5 million,\n• Other noninterest expense of $8 million, and\n• Net impact of $15 million for the tax effect of notable items.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN\n• Net interest income totaled $1.80 billion for the current quarter, a decrease of $25 million from the linked\nquarter. Net interest income related to PAA was $101 million compared to $140 million in the linked\nquarter, a decrease of $39 million. Net interest income, excluding PAA, was $1.70 billion compared to\n$1.68 billion in the linked quarter, an increase of $14 million.\n• The decrease in net interest income was due to a $33 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by\nan $8 million increase in interest income.\n• The increase of $8 million in interest income was due to increases in interest on investment securities and\nloans of $28 million and $8 million, respectively, which were partially offset by a $28 million decrease in\ninterest on interest-earning deposits at banks.\n◦ Higher average balances led to a $46 million increase in loan interest income, which was partially\noffset by a $38 million decrease in loan PAA income, resulting in an $8 million increase in loan\ninterest income compared to the linked quarter.\n◦ Continued purchases of short duration investment securities increased the average balance and\ninterest income for investment securities and decreased the average balance and interest income for\ninterest-earning deposits at banks.\n• The $33 million increase in interest expense was mostly due to a $29 million increase in interest expense on\ndeposits, primarily related to growth in money market deposits in the Branch Network and savings deposits\nin the Direct Bank, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of time deposits.\n• Net interest margin was 3.53% compared to 3.64% in the linked quarter. Net interest margin, excluding\nPAA, was 3.33% compared to 3.36% in the linked quarter.\n◦ The yield on average interest-earning assets was 6.18%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the linked\nquarter, primarily due to decreases in the yield on interest-earning deposits at banks and loan\naccretion, partially offset by a higher yield on investment securities.\n◦ The rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 3 basis points from the linked quarter,\nprimarily due to a higher average rate paid on money market deposits, partially offset by lower\naverage rates paid on all other interest-bearing deposits. While the rate paid on average money\nmarket deposits increased compared to the linked quarter, it declined late in the current quarter.\nNONINTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE\n• Noninterest income totaled $650 million, an increase of $11 million compared to the linked quarter.\nNoninterest income in the current quarter included a realized gain of $4 million on the sale of marketable\nequity securities and an $11 million favorable fair value adjustment on marketable equity securities relative\nto the linked quarter.\n• Adjusted noninterest income was $474 million compared to $479 million in the linked quarter, a decrease of\n$5 million. The decrease in adjusted noninterest income was a result of an $18 million decline in other\nnoninterest income, mainly attributable to fair value changes in customer derivative positions and other\nnonmarketable investments, partially offset by increases of $4 million in fee income and other service\ncharges, $3 million in adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment, and $6 million spread among\nvarious noninterest income line items.\n• Noninterest expense was $1.46 billion compared to $1.39 billion in the linked quarter, an increase of $70\nmillion. Salaries and benefits increased $43 million, mainly attributable to an additional working day in the\ncurrent quarter, net staff additions, increases in incentive accruals and temporary labor associated with\ntechnology projects. Professional fees increased $18 million, mostly related to continued enhancements to\nour large financial institution regulatory compliance capabilities. The remaining increase of $9 million was\nspread among various noninterest expense line items.\n• Adjusted noninterest expense was $1.23 billion compared to $1.17 billion in the linked quarter, an increase\nof $61 million, mostly related to the previously discussed increases in salaries and benefits and professional\nfees.\nBALANCE SHEET SUMMARY\n• Loans and leases totaled $138.70 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $646 million (0.5% linked\nquarter decline) compared to $139.34 billion at June 30, 2024 as the decrease in the SVB Commercial\nsegment was partially offset by loan growth in the General Bank and Commercial Bank segments.\n◦ The decrease in the SVB Commercial segment of $2.12 billion (5.0% linked quarter decline) was\nprimarily due to declines in Global Fund Banking as repayment levels outpaced draw activity on\nnew lines of credit.\n◦ Loan growth in the General Bank segment of $897 million (1.4% linked quarter growth) was\nprimarily related to commercial and business loans in the Branch Network.\n◦ Loan growth of $573 million (1.8% linked quarter growth) in the Commercial Bank segment was\nprimarily due to growth in the Tech Media and Telecom and Healthcare verticals.\n• Total investment securities were $38.66 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $997 million since\nJune 30, 2024. The increase was mainly attributable to purchases of approximately $2.58 billion short\nduration U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency mortgage-backed investment securities available for sale during the\ncurrent quarter, partially offset by paydowns and maturities.\n• Deposits totaled $151.57 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $495 million since June 30, 2024\n(0.3% linked quarter growth). The increase was mostly due to growth in the General Bank and SVB\nCommercial segments, which was partially offset by declines in the Commercial Bank segment and the\nDirect Bank.\n◦ Deposit growth in the General Bank segment of $690 million was primarily due to money market\ndeposits in the Branch Network.\n◦ Deposit growth in the SVB Commercial segment of $54 million was primarily due to an increase in\nmoney market deposits, partially offset by declines in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing\nchecking.\n◦ Deposits in the Commercial Bank segment decreased by $204 million as declines in noninterest-\nbearing and interest-bearing checking were partially offset by growth in money market deposits.\n◦ Corporate deposits, which includes the Direct Bank, declined by $49 million, mostly due to a\ndecline in time deposits, partially offset by growth in savings deposits.\n• Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 26.0% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024, compared to\n26.5% at June 30, 2024. The cost of average total deposits was 2.64% for the current quarter, compared to\n2.61% for the linked quarter. While the cost of average total deposits increased 3 basis points from the\nlinked quarter, the pace slowed relative to the 8 basis point increase in the linked quarter compared to the\nfirst quarter of 2024.\n• Funding mix remained stable with 80.3% of the total funding composed of deposits.\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND CREDIT QUALITY\n• Provision for credit losses totaled $117 million for the current quarter compared to $95 million for the\nlinked quarter, an increase of $22 million. The current quarter provision for credit losses included a loan\nand lease loss provision of $123 million, partially offset by a benefit for off-balance sheet credit exposure of\n$6 million.\n◦ The provision for loan and lease losses of $123 million increased $28 million compared to the\nlinked quarter, mainly attributable to an increase in net charge-offs of $13 million, changes in the\nmacroeconomic forecast, higher specific reserves, and an estimate of $20 million related to\nHurricane Helene.\n• Net charge-offs totaled $145 million for the current quarter, representing 0.42% of average loans, compared\nto $132 million, or 0.38% of average loans, for the linked quarter. The $13 million increase in net charge-\noffs was mainly related to the Real Estate Finance and Equipment Finance portfolios in the Commercial\nBank segment.\n• Nonaccrual loans were $1.24 billion, or 0.90% of loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.14 billion,\nor 0.82% of loans, at June 30, 2024. The increase in nonaccrual loans was concentrated in the SVB\nCommercial segment.\n• The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $1.68 billion, or 1.21% of loans, at September 30, 2024,\ndown from 1.22% at June 30, 2024. The net decline in the allowance ratio reflected a reserve release of $22\nmillion for the current quarter, compared to a $37 million reserve release in the linked quarter. The $22\nmillion reserve release in the current quarter was primarily due to changes in credit quality and lower loan\nbalances, partially offset by changes in the macroeconomic forecast, higher specific reserves, and the\nestimate related to Hurricane Helene.\nCAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY\n• Capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements. The estimated total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-\nbased capital, Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios were 15.36%, 13.78%,\n13.24%, and 10.20%, respectively, at September 30, 2024.\n• During the current quarter, we repurchased 353,058 of our Class A common shares for $700 million and\npaid a dividend of $1.64 per share on our Class A and Class B common stock. Shares repurchased during\nthe current quarter represented 2.61% of Class A common shares and 2.43% of total Class A and Class B\ncommon shares outstanding at June 30, 2024.\n• Liquidity position remains strong as liquid assets were $58.36 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to\n$56.91 billion at June 30, 2024.\nEARNINGS CALL/ WEBCAST DETAILS\nBancShares will host a conference call to discuss the company's financial results on Thursday, October 24, 2024, at\n9 a.m. Eastern time.\nThe call may be accessed via webcast on the company’s website at ir.firstcitizens.com or through the dial-in details\nbelow:\nNorth America: 1-833-470-1428\nAll other locations: 1-929-526-1599\nAccess code: 970671\nOur earnings release, investor presentation, and financial supplement are available at ir.firstcitizens.com.

Words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,”\n“expects,” “predicts,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “targets,” “designed,” “could,” “may,” “should,”\n“will,” “potential,” “continue,” “aims” or other similar words and expressions are intended to identify these\nforward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on BancShares’ current expectations and\nassumptions regarding BancShares’ business, the economy, and other future conditions.\nBecause forward-looking statements relate to future results and occurrences, they are subject to inherent risks,\nuncertainties, changes in circumstances and other factors that are difficult to predict. Many possible events or\nfactors could affect BancShares’ future financial results and performance and could cause actual results,\nperformance or achievements of BancShares to differ materially from any anticipated results expressed or implied\nby such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, general competitive,\neconomic, political (including the upcoming U.S. election), geopolitical events (including conflicts in Ukraine and\nthe Middle East) and market conditions, including changes in competitive pressures among financial institutions and\nthe impacts related to or resulting from recent bank failures, the risks and impacts of future bank failures and other\nvolatility in the banking industry, public perceptions of our business practices, including our deposit pricing and\nacquisition activity, the financial success or changing conditions or strategies of BancShares’ vendors or customers,\nincluding changes in demand for deposits, loans and other financial services, fluctuations in interest rates, changes\nin the quality or composition of BancShares’ loan or investment portfolio, actions of government regulators,\nincluding the recent interest rate cut and any changes by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (the\n“Federal Reserve”), changes to estimates of future costs and benefits of actions taken by BancShares, BancShares’\nability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity, the potential impact of decisions by the Federal\nReserve on BancShares’ capital plans, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions,\nincluding significant turbulence in the capital or financial markets, the impact of any sustained or elevated\ninflationary environment, the impact of any cyberattack, information or security breach, the impact of\nimplementation and compliance with current or proposed laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including\npotential increased regulatory requirements, limitations, and costs, such as FDIC special assessments, increases to\nFDIC deposit insurance premiums and the proposed interagency rule on regulatory capital, along with the risk that\nsuch laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations may change, the availability of capital and personnel, and the\nrisks associated with BancShares’ previous acquisition transactions, including the acquisition of certain assets and\nliabilities of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. and the previously completed transaction with CIT Group Inc., or\nany future transactions.\nBancShares’ share repurchase program allows BancShares to repurchase shares of its Class A common stock\nthrough 2025. BancShares is not obligated under the share repurchase program to repurchase any minimum or\nparticular number of shares, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time (subject to the terms of\nany Rule 10b5-1 plan in effect) without prior notice. The authorization to repurchase Class A common stock will be\nutilized at management’s discretion. The actual timing and amount of Class A common stock that may be\nrepurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the terms of any Rule 10b5-1 plan then in effect, price,\ngeneral business and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and alternative investment opportunities or capital\nneeds.\nExcept to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations, BancShares disclaims any obligation to update\nforward-looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking\nstatements included herein to reflect future events or developments. Additional factors which could affect the\nforward-looking statements can be found in BancShares’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and its other filings with the SEC.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nCertain measures in this release, including those referenced as “adjusted,” as well as net interest income and net\ninterest margin, excluding PAA, are “non-GAAP,” meaning they are numerical measures of BancShares’ financial\nperformance, financial position or cash flows that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”) because they exclude or include amounts or are adjusted in some way\nso as to be different than the most direct comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP\nin BancShares’ statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows and also are not codified in U.S.\nbanking regulations currently applicable to BancShares. BancShares management believes that non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial information, can provide transparency about or an\nalternative means of assessing its operating results, financial position or cash flows to its investors, analysts and\nmanagement. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or a substitute for,\nGAAP measures. Each non-GAAP measure is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure in the non-GAAP\nreconciliation.

Refer to Section V of this presentation for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP s el\nfinancial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nReclassifications\nIn certain instances, amounts reported for prior periods in this investor presentation have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously\nreported stockholders’ equity or net income.\nBancShares modified its reportable segments during the first quarter of 2024. The Private Banking and Wealth Management components of the SVB segment were integrated into the General Bank segment. The SVB\nsegment was renamed the SVB Commercial segment since it is comprised of the commercial business lines from the SVB acquisition, including Global Fund Banking and Technology and Healthcare Banking. The Direct\nBank was previously allocated to the General Bank segment, but is now included in Corporate. Segment disclosures for 2023 periods included in this investor presentation were recast to reflect the segment reporting\nchanges summarized above.\nAdditionally, BancShares modified its loan disclosures by class in the first quarter of 2024. Loans were previously aggregated into Commercial, Consumer, and SVB portfolios, each of which consisted of several loan\nclasses. Loans classes including the private bank, CRE, and other loan classes previously mapped to the SVB portfolio were mapped to the applicable loan classes within the Commercial and Consumer portfolios.\nThe methodologies that we use to allocate items among our segments are dynamic and may be updated periodically to reflect enhanced expense base allocation drivers, changes in the risk profile of a segment or\nchanges in our organizational structure. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically to reflect these enhancements.\n3Q24 Additions\n4 PAA - Purchase Accounting Accretion\nGlossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms LFI – Large Financial Institution\nVC – Venture Capital\nThe following is a list of certain abbreviations and acronyms used throughout this document.

There is no net impact to earnings for this non-GAAP item because adjusted noninterest income and expense are reduced by the same amount. Management believes\nadjusted rental income on operating lease equipment (non-GAAP) is meaningful because it helps management monitor the performance and profitability of the operating leases after deducting direct\nexpenses.

Management utilizes both GAAP and adjusted measures (non-GAAP) to\nanalyze BancShares’ performance. Refer to subsequent pages of this financial supplement for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasures.\n(2) Depreciation and maintenance and other operating lease expenses are deducted from rental income on operating lease equipment to calculate adjusted rental income on operating\nlease equipment (non-GAAP). There is no net impact to earnings for this non-GAAP item because adjusted noninterest income and expense are reduced by the same amount.\nManagement believes adjusted rental income on operating lease equipment (non-GAAP) is meaningful because it helps management monitor the performance and profitability of the\noperating leases after deducting direct expenses. Refer to subsequent pages of this financial supplement for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable\nGAAP measures.\n(3) Other noninterest income includes a gain on litigation settlement in the 2024 YTD period and a Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A purchase accounting adjustment related to FX\ntranslation in the 2023 QTD and YTD periods.\n(4) Professional fees include expenses related to integration activities.\n(5) Other noninterest expense consists of a technology fee in 3Q24 and a litigation reserve release in 2Q24.\n(6) For the periods presented, the income tax impact may include tax discrete items and changes in the estimated annualized effective tax rate.\nDollars in millions, except share and per share data\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nCondensed Income Statements (unaudited) - Adjusted for Notable September 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\nItems (1) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest income $ 3,138 $ 3,130 $ 3,110 $ 9,352 $ 7,274\nInterest expense 1,342 1,309 1,120 3,918 2,473\nNet interest income 1,796 1,821 1,990 5,434 4,801\nProvision for credit losses 117 95 195 276 410\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 1,679 1,726 1,795 5,158 4,391\nNoninterest income 474 479 468 1,431 1,239\nNoninterest expense 1,229 1,168 1,132 3,551 3,011\nIncome before income taxes 924 1,037 1,131 3,038 2,619\nIncome tax expense 249 282 303 824 705\nNet income $ 675 $ 755 $ 828 $ 2,214 $ 1,914\nPreferred stock dividends 15 16 15 46 44\nNet income available to common stockholders $ 660 $ 739 $ 813 $ 2,168 $ 1,870\nBasic earnings per common share $ 45.87 $ 50.87 $ 55.96 $ 149.72 $ 128.74\nDiluted earnings per common share 45.87 50.87 55.92 149.71 128.64\nWeighted average common shares outstanding (basic) 14,375,974 14,534,499 14,528,310 14,480,874 14,527,718\nWeighted average common shares outstanding (diluted) 14,375,974 14,534,499 14,539,133 14,481,919 14,539,383\n(1) The GAAP income statements and notable items are included previously in this financial supplement.
