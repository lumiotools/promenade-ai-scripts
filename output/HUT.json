In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware\nthat in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as\nNon-recurring transactions2 (14,530) — or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The\nCompany’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests (261) — an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-\nrecurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not\nmodify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such\nStock-based compensation expense 4,957 303 modification may be material.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 measure. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss)\nbefore interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and\namortization, further adjusted by the removal of gains on the\nNet income $ (72,190) $ (1,686)\nextinguishment of debt (if applicable), unrealized gains (losses) on\nderivatives, depreciation and amortization embedded in the equity in\nInterest expense 6,012 5,657 earnings (losses) from an unconsolidated joint venture, foreign exchange\ngains or losses, gain or loss on the sale of property and equipment (if\napplicable), non-recurring transactions, loss from discontinued\nIncome tax provision (1,874) 322\noperations, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, and\nstock-based compensation expense in the period presented.\nDepreciation and amortization 11,531 4,064\nThe Company’s board of directors and management team use Adjusted\nEBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to\nUnrealized gain on derivatives (17,219) — compare operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by\nremoving the effects of capital structure (such as varying levels of interest\nShare of unconsolidated joint venture depreciation and amortization1 7,837 7,627 expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and\namortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions\nmentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from\nForeign exchange loss (gain) (720) — period to period.\nNon-recurring transactions2 21 (1,531) Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to\nAdjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware\nthat in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as\nLoss from discontinued operations 1,738 — or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The\nCompany’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests 324 — an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-\nrecurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not\nmodify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such\nStock-based compensation expense 7,010 314 modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important\nlimitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted\nEBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (57,530) $ 14,767\nunder GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by\nother companies in the industry, the Company’s definition of this non-\nGAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nNote: (1) Net of the accretion of fair value differences of depreciable and amortizable assets included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in accordance with ASC 323;\n(2) Non-recurring transactions for the three months ended March 31, 2024 represent approximately $1.4 million of transaction costs related to the Far North acquisition and $2.9 million related to restructuring cost.\nHUT 8 INVESTOR PRESENTATION 35\nINVESTOR RELATIONS\nIR@HUT8.COM"
