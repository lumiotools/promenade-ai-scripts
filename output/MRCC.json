Loss sustained by any nominee organized by the Insured for the purpose of handling certain of its business transactions and composed exclusively of its Employees shall, for all the purposes of this bond and whether or not any partner of such nominee is implicated in such loss, be deemed to be loss sustained by the Insured. ADDITIONAL OFFICES OR EMPLOYEES—CONSOLIDATION, MERGER OR PURCHASE OF ASSETS—NOTICE B. If the Insured shall, while this bond is in force, establish any additional offices, other than by consolidation or merger with, or purchase or acquisition of assets or liabilities of, another institution such offices shall be automatically covered hereunder from the date of such establishment without the requirement of notice to the Underwriter or the payment of additional premium for the remainder of the premium period. If the Insured shall, while this bond is in force, consolidate or merge with, or purchase or acquire assets or liabilities of, another institution, the Insured shall not have such coverage as is afforded under this bond for loss which (a) has occurred or will occur in offices or premises, or (b) has been caused or will be caused by an employee or employees of such institution, or (c) has arisen or will arise out of the assets or liabilities acquired by the Insured as a result of such consolidation, merger or purchase or acquisition of assets or liabilities unless the Insured shall (i) give the Underwriter written notice of the proposed consolidation, merger or purchase or acquisition of assets or liabilities prior to the proposed effective date of such action and (ii) obtain the written consent of the Underwriter to extend the coverage provided by this bond to such additional offices or premises, Employees and other exposures, and \n\n![](https://cdn.kscope.io/02b886a8aec001166997d2b7bc8f5dd8-monroefidelitybond-secfi007.jpg)\n\nTSB 5062b 1087 Copyright, The Surety Association of America, 1987 Page 4 of 7 (iii) upon obtaining such consent, pay to the Underwriter an additional premium.

As used in this General Agreement, control means the power to determine the management or policy of a controlling holding company or the Insured by virtue of voting stock ownership. A change in ownership of voting stock which results in direct or indirect ownership by a stockholder or an affiliated group of stockholders of ten percent (10%) or more of such stock shall be presumed to result in a change of control for the purpose of the required notice. Failure to give the required notice shall result in termination of coverage for any loss involving a transferee, to be effective upon the date of the stock transfer. REPRESENTATION OF INSURED D. The Insured represents that the information furnished in the application for this bond is complete, true and correct. Such application constitutes part of this bond. Any misrepresentation, omission, concealment or incorrect statement of a material fact, in the application or otherwise, shall be grounds for the rescission of this bond. JOINT INSURED E. If two or more Insureds are covered under this bond, the first named Insured shall act for all Insureds. Payment by the Underwriter to the first named Insured of loss sustained by any Insured shall fully release the Underwriter on account of such loss. If the first named Insured ceases to be covered under this bond, the Insured next named shall thereafter be considered as the first named Insured. Knowledge possessed or discovery made by any Insured shall constitute knowledge or discovery by all Insureds for all purposes of this bond. The liability of the Underwriter for loss or losses sustained by all Insureds shall not exceed the amount for which the Underwriter would have been liable had all such loss or losses been sustained by one Insured. NOTICE OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST INSURED—ELECTION TO DEFEND F. The Insured shall notify the Underwriter at the earliest practicable moment, not to exceed 30 days after notice thereof, of any legal proceeding brought to determine the Insured’s liability for any loss, claim or damage, which, if established, would constitute a collectible loss under this bond. Concurrently, the Insured shall furnish copies of all pleadings and pertinent papers to the Underwriter. The Underwriter, at its sole option, may elect to conduct the defense of such legal proceeding, in whole or in part. The defense by the Underwriter shall be in the Insured’s name through attorneys selected by the Underwriter. The Insured shall provide all reasonable information and assistance required by the Underwriter for such defense. If the Underwriter elects to defend the Insured, in whole or in part, any judgment against the Insured on those counts or causes of action which the Underwriter defended on behalf of the Insured or any settlement in which the Underwriter participates and all attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Underwriter in the defense of the litigation shall be a loss covered by this bond. If the Insured does not give the notices required in subsection (a) of Section 5 of this bond and in the first paragraph of this General Agreement, or if the Underwriter elects not to defend any causes of action, neither a judgment against the Insured, nor a settlement of any legal proceeding by the Insured, shall determine the existence, extent or amount of coverage under this bond for loss sustained by the Insured, and the Underwriter shall not be liable for any attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Insured. With respect to this General Agreement, subsections (b) and (d) of Section 5 of this bond apply upon the entry of such judgment or the occurrence of such settlement instead of upon discovery of loss. In addition, the Insured must notify the Underwriter within 30 days after such judgment is entered against it or after the Insured settles such legal proceeding, and, subject to subsection (e) of Section 5, the Insured may not bring legal proceedings for the recovery of such loss after the expiration of 24 months from the date of such final judgment or settlement.

DISCOVERY Section 3. This bond applies to loss discovered by the Insured during the Bond Period. Discovery occurs when the Insured first becomes aware of facts which would cause a reasonable person to assume that a loss of a type covered by this bond has been or will be incurred, regardless of when the act or acts causing or contributing to such loss occurred, even though the exact amount or details of loss may not then be known. Discovery also occurs when the Insured receives notice of an actual or potential claim in which it is alleged that the Insured is liable to a third party under circumstances which, if true, would constitute a loss under this bond. LIMIT OF LIABILITY Section 4. Aggregate Limit of Liability The Underwriter’s total liability for all losses discovered during the Bond Period shown in Item 2 of the Declarations shall not exceed the Aggregate Limit of Liability shown in Item 3 of the Declarations. The Aggregate Limit of Liability shall be reduced by the amount of any payment made under the terms of this bond.

The Aggregate Limit of Liability shall not be increased or reinstated by any recovery made and applied in accordance with subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 7. In the event that a loss of Property is settled by the Underwriter through the use of a lost instrument bond, such loss shall not reduce the Aggregate Limit of Liability. Single Loss Limit of Liability Subject to the Aggregate Limit of Liability, the Underwriter’s liability for each Single Loss shall not exceed the applicable Single Loss Limit of Liability shown in Item 4 of the Declarations. If a Single Loss is covered under more than one Insuring Agreement or Coverage, the maximum payable shall not exceed the largest applicable Single Loss Limit of Liability.

(e) If any limitation embodied in this bond is prohibited by any law controlling the construction hereof, such limitation shall be deemed to be amended so as to equal the minimum period of limitation provided by such law. (f) This bond affords coverage only in favor of the Insured. No suit, action or legal proceedings shall be brought hereunder by any one other than the named Insured. VALUATION Section 6. Any loss of Money, or loss payable in Money, shall be paid, at the option of the Insured, in the Money of the country in which the loss was sustained or in the United States of America dollar equivalent thereof determined at the rate of exchange at the time of payment of such loss. Securities The Underwriter shall settle in kind its liability under this bond on account of a loss of any securities or, at the option of the Insured, shall pay to the Insured the cost of replacing such securities, determined by the market value thereof at the time of such settlement. However, if prior to such settlement the Insured shall be compelled by the demands of a third party or by market rules to purchase equivalent securities, and gives written notification of this to the Underwriter, the cost incurred by the Insured shall be taken as the value of those securities. In case of a loss of subscription, conversion or redemption privileges through the misplacement or loss of securities, the amount of such loss shall be the value of such privileges immediately preceding the expiration thereof. If such securities cannot be replaced or have no quoted market value, or if such privileges have no quoted market value, their value shall be determined by agreement or arbitration. If the applicable coverage of this bond is subject to a Deductible Amount and/or is not sufficient in amount to indemnify the Insured in full for the loss of securities for which claim is made hereunder, the liability of the Underwriter under this bond is limited to the payment for, or the duplication of, so much of such securities as has a value equal to the amount of such applicable coverage. \n\n![](https://cdn.kscope.io/02b886a8aec001166997d2b7bc8f5dd8-monroefidelitybond-secfi010.jpg)\n\nTSB 5062b 1087 Copyright, The Surety Association of America, 1987 Page 7 of 7 Books of Account and Other Records In case of loss of, or damage to, any books of account or other records used by the Insured in its business, the Underwriter shall be liable under this bond only if such books or records are actually reproduced and then for not more than the cost of the blank books, blank pages or other materials plus the cost of labor for the actual transcription or copying of data which shall have been furnished by the Insured in order to reproduce such books and other records. Property other than Money, Securities or Records In case of loss of, or damage to, any Property other than Money, securities, books of account or other records, or damage covered under Insuring Agreement (B)(2), the Underwriter shall not be liable for more than the actual cash value of such Property, or of items covered under Insuring Agreement (B)(2). The Underwriter may, at its election, pay the actual cash value of, replace or repair such property. Disagreement between the Underwriter and the Insured as to the cash value or as to the adequacy of repair or replacement shall be resolved by arbitration.

(b) In the event of payment under this bond, the Underwriter shall be subrogated to all of the Insured’s rights of recovery therefor against any person or entity to the extent of such payment. (c) Recoveries, whether effected by the Underwriter or by the Insured, shall be applied net of the expense of such recovery first to the satisfaction of the Insured’s loss which would otherwise have been paid but for the fact that it is in excess of either the Single or Aggregate Limit of Liability, secondly, to the Underwriter as reimbursement of amounts paid in settlement of the Insured’s claim, and thirdly, to the Insured in satisfaction of any Deductible Amount. Recovery on account of loss of securities as set forth in the second paragraph of Section 6 or recovery from reinsurance and/or indemnity of the Underwriter shall not be deemed a recovery as used herein.

Koenig commented, “We are pleased to announce a $0.25 per share dividend for the 18th consecutive quarter. Our predominantly first lien portfolio continues to offer compelling risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders with an attractive 12.3% annualized dividend yield. We remain focused on maintaining the portfolio’s asset quality in this current economic environment and delivering consistent value for stockholders.”\n\nMonroe Capital Corporation is a business development company affiliate of the award-winning private credit investment firm and lender, Monroe Capital LLC.\n\n______________________________________________________________________(1) Based on an annualized dividend and closing share price as of November 11, 2024.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\nAdjusted Net Investment Income totaled $6.6 million, or $0.31 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a slight decrease from $6.7 million, or $0.31 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. NAV decreased by $0.02 per share, or 0.2%, to $198.9 million or $9.18 per share as of September 30, 2024, compared to $199.3 million or $9.20 per share as of June 30, 2024. The slight decline in NAV this quarter was primarily the result of net unrealized losses attributable to certain portfolio companies, partially offset by NII in excess of the dividend paid during the quarter.\n\nAt quarter end, the Company's debt-to-equity leverage decreased from 1.54 times debt-to-equity at June 30, 2024 to 1.50 times debt-to-equity at September 30, 2024 as a result of paydowns of the revolving credit facility with proceeds from investment sales and paydowns during the quarter. We continue to focus on managing our investment portfolio and selectively redeploying capital resulting from future repayments.\n\n**Selected Financial Highlights**(in thousands, except per share data)\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities data:** | (unaudited)  \nInvestments, at fair value | $ | 474,259 | $ | 485,804  \nTotal assets | $ | 501,862 | $ | 512,113  \nNet assets | $ | 198,893 | $ | 199,344  \nNet asset value per share | $ | 9.18 | $ | 9.20  \n  \n**Three months ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024**  \n**Consolidated Statements of Operations data:** | (unaudited)  \nNet investment income | $ | 6,481 | $ | 6,559  \nAdjusted net investment income(2) | $ | 6,617 | $ | 6,694  \nNet gain (loss) | $ | (1,515 | ) | $ | (3,301 | )  \nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations | $ | 4,966 | $ | 3,258  \nPer share data:  \nNet investment income | $ | 0.30 | $ | 0.30  \nAdjusted net investment income(2) | $ | 0.31 | $ | 0.31  \nNet gain (loss) | $ | (0.07 | ) | $ | (0.15 | )  \nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations | $ | 0.23 | $ | 0.15  \n  \n______________________________________________________________________(2) See _Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income_ below for a detailed description of this non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation from NII to Adjusted Net Investment Income. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company.\n\n**Portfolio Review**\n\nThe Company had debt and equity investments in 94 portfolio companies, with a total fair value of $474.3 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to debt and equity investments in 94 portfolio companies, with a total fair value of $485.8 million, as of June 30, 2024. The Company’s portfolio consists primarily of first lien loans, representing 80.0% of the portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and 81.1% of the portfolio as of June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average contractual and effective yields on the Company’s debt and preferred equity investments were 11.0% and 11.0%, respectively, as compared to 11.9% and 11.9%, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. The decreases in yields were primarily due to the decline in base rates and the placement of an additional portfolio company on non-accrual status during the quarter. Portfolio yield is calculated only on the portion of the portfolio that has a contractual coupon and therefore does not account for dividends on equity investments (other than preferred equity). As of September 30, 2024, portfolio investments on non-accrual status represented 3.1% of the Company’s total investments at fair value.\n\n**Financial Review**\n\nNII for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $6.5 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to $6.6 million, or $0.30 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Adjusted Net Investment Income was $6.6 million, or $0.31 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.7 million, or $0.31 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Excluding the impact of the incentive fee limitations of $(0.7) million and $(1.0) million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, Adjusted Net Investment Income totaled $5.9 million, or $0.27 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase from $5.7 million, or $0.26 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Please refer to the Company’s Form 10-Q for additional information on the Company's incentive fee structure and calculation.\n\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $15.7 million, compared to $15.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Total investment income increased by $0.1 million primarily due to an increase in fee income stemming from portfolio investment realizations during the quarter included in other income. This increase was partially offset by a decline in interest income primarily resulting from placing an additional portfolio investment on non-accrual status during the quarter and a decrease in average invested assets during the quarter.\n\nTotal expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $9.2 million, compared to $9.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Excluding the impact of the incentive fee limitations, total expenses decreased by $0.2 million primarily due to lower interest and other debt financing expenses associated with a decrease in average debt outstanding during the quarter.\n\nNet gain (loss) was $(1.5) million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(3.3) million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to unrealized mark-to-market losses attributable to certain portfolio companies that have underlying credit performance concerns that were still held as of quarter end, partially offset by a net gain on the remainder of the portfolio. The Company's average portfolio mark decreased by 0.9%, from 94.4% of amortized cost as of June 30, 2024 to 93.9% of amortized cost as of September 30, 2024.\n\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $5.0 million, or $0.23 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.3 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $4.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $169.0 million of debt outstanding on its revolving credit facility and $130.0 million of debt outstanding on its 2026 Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $86.0 million available for additional borrowings on its revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing base availability.\n\n**MRCC Senior Loan Fund**\n\nMRCC Senior Loan Fund I, LLC (\"SLF\") is a joint venture with Life Insurance Company of the Southwest (“LSW”), an affiliate of National Life Insurance Company. SLF invests primarily in senior secured loans to middle market companies in the United States. The Company and LSW have each committed $50.0 million of capital to the joint venture. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had made net capital contributions of $42.7 million in SLF with a fair value of $32.9 million, as compared to net capital contributions of $42.7 million in SLF with a fair value of $33.1 million as of June 30, 2024. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company received dividend income from SLF of $0.9 million, consistent with the $0.9 million received during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. SLF’s underlying investments are loans to middle-market borrowers that are generally larger than the rest of MRCC’s portfolio which is focused on lower middle-market companies. SLF’s average mark on the underlying investment portfolio decreased during the quarter, from 88.3% of amortized cost as of June 30, 2024, to 87.0% of amortized cost as of September 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, SLF had total assets of $107.8 million (including investments at fair value of $98.7 million), total liabilities of $42.0 million (including borrowings under the $110.0 million secured revolving credit facility with Capital One, N.A. (the “SLF Credit Facility”) of $41.5 million) and total members’ capital of $65.8 million. As of June 30, 2024, SLF had total assets of $117.3 million (including investments at fair value of $109.7 million), total liabilities of $51.1 million (including borrowings under the SLF Credit Facility of $50.8 million) and total members’ capital of $66.2 million.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income**\n\nOn a supplemental basis, the Company discloses Adjusted Net Investment Income (including on a per share basis) which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America (“non-GAAP”). Adjusted Net Investment Income represents NII, excluding the net capital gains incentive fee and income taxes. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company. The management agreement with the Company’s advisor provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses for such year. Management believes that Adjusted Net Investment Income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any net capital gains incentive fee as NII does not include gains associated with the capital gains incentive fee.\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation from NII (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted Net Investment Income for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024**  \n**Amount** | **Per ShareAmount** | **Amount** | **Per ShareAmount**  \n(unaudited)  \nNet investment income | $ | 6,481 | $ | 0.30 | $ | 6,559 | $ | 0.30  \nNet capital gains incentive fee | — | — | — | —  \nIncome taxes, including excise taxes | 136 | 0.01 | 135 | 0.01  \nAdjusted Net Investment Income | $ | 6,617 | $ | 0.31 | $ | 6,694 | $ | 0.31  \n  \nAdjusted Net Investment Income may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as it is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, Adjusted Net Investment Income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss these operating and financial results on Wednesday, November 13, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Koenig commented, “We are pleased to announce a $0.25 per share dividend for the 17th consecutive quarter. Our predominantly first lien portfolio continues to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders with a 14.0% annualized dividend yield. Our focus remains on maintaining the portfolio’s asset quality in the face of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment and delivering value for stockholders.”\n\nMonroe Capital Corporation is a business development company affiliate of the award-winning private credit investment firm and lender, Monroe Capital LLC. ______________________________________________________________________ (1) Based on an annualized dividend and closing share price as of August 6, 2024.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\nAdjusted Net Investment Income totaled $6.7 million or $0.31 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This compares with $5.5 million or $0.25 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Total investment income increased by $0.4 million as a result of an increase in average invested assets during the quarter and an increase in other income as part of a portfolio company realization during the quarter. This increase was partially offset by an increase in interest and other debt financing expenses of $0.3 million associated with an increase in average debt outstanding during the quarter. Additionally, during the quarter, incentive fees were limited by $1.0 million as a result of the total return requirement in the Company's incentive fee structure. Please refer to the Company’s Form 10-Q for additional information on the incentive fee calculation. See Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income discussion below.\n\nNAV decreased by $0.10 per share, or 1.1%, to $199.3 million or $9.20 per share as of June 30, 2024, compared to $201.5 million or $9.30 per share as of March 31, 2024. The decrease in NAV this quarter was primarily the result of net unrealized losses attributable to certain portfolio companies, partially offset by NII in excess of the dividend paid during the quarter.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company's debt-to-equity leverage decreased from 1.60 times debt-to-equity to 1.54 times debt-to-equity. While average leverage was slightly up during the quarter, leverage at quarter end decreased as a result of paydowns of the revolving credit facility with proceeds from investment sales and paydowns which were more heavily weighted towards the end of the quarter. We continue to focus on managing our investment portfolio and selectively redeploying capital resulting from future repayments.\n\n**Selected Financial Highlights** (in thousands, except per share data)\n\n**June 30, 2024** | **March 31, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities data:** | (unaudited)  \nInvestments, at fair value | $ | 485,804 | $ | 500,889  \nTotal assets | $ | 512,113 | $ | 527,488  \nNet assets | $ | 199,344 | $ | 201,502  \nNet asset value per share | $ | 9.20 | $ | 9.30  \n  \n**Three months ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024** | **March 31, 2024**  \n**Consolidated Statements of Operations data:** | (unaudited)  \nNet investment income | $ | 6,559 | $ | 5,470  \nAdjusted net investment income(2) | $ | 6,694 | $ | 5,488  \nNet gain (loss) | $ | (3,301 | ) | $ | (2,275 | )  \nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations | $ | 3,258 | $ | 3,195  \nPer share data:  \nNet investment income | $ | 0.30 | $ | 0.25  \nAdjusted net investment income(2) | $ | 0.31 | $ | 0.25  \nNet gain (loss) | $ | (0.15 | ) | $ | (0.10 | )  \nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations | $ | 0.15 | $ | 0.15  \n  \n______________________________________________________________________ (2) See _Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income_ below for a detailed description of this non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation from NII to Adjusted Net Investment Income. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company.\n\n**Portfolio Review**\n\nThe Company had debt and equity investments in 94 portfolio companies, with a total fair value of $485.8 million as of June 30, 2024, as compared to debt and equity investments in 98 portfolio companies, with a total fair value of $500.9 million, as of March 31, 2024. The Company’s portfolio consists primarily of first lien loans, representing 81.1% of the portfolio as of June 30, 2024, and 81.9% of the portfolio as of March 31, 2024. As of both June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the weighted average contractual and effective yield on the Company’s debt and preferred equity investments was 11.9% and 11.9%, respectively. Portfolio yield is calculated only on the portion of the portfolio that has a contractual coupon and therefore does not account for dividends on equity investments (other than preferred equity). As of June 30, 2024, loans and preferred equity investments on non-accrual status represented 1.9% of the Company’s total investments at fair value.\n\n**Financial Review**\n\nNII for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 totaled $6.6 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to $5.5 million, or $0.25 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted Net Investment Income was $6.7 million, or $0.31 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $5.5 million, or $0.25 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 totaled $15.6 million, compared to $15.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Investment income increased by $0.4 million, as a result of the increase in the size of the Company’s average investment portfolio during the quarter and an increase in other income as part of a portfolio company realization during the quarter.\n\nTotal expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $9.1 million, compared to $9.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Excluding the impact of the incentive fee limitation of $(1.0) million, total expenses increased by $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in interest and other debt financing expenses and a slight increase in income taxes, including excise tax.\n\nNet gain (loss) was $(3.3) million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $(2.3) million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. This net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to unrealized mark-to-market losses attributable to certain portfolio companies that have underlying credit performance concerns that were still held as of quarter end, partially offset by a slight gain on the remainder of the portfolio. The Company's average portfolio mark decreased by 0.9%, from 95.3% of amortized cost as of March 31, 2024 to 94.4% of amortized cost as of June 30, 2024.\n\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $3.3 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $3.2 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had $3.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $177.8 million of debt outstanding on its revolving credit facility and $130.0 million of debt outstanding on its 2026 Notes. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $77.2 million available for additional borrowings on its revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing base availability.\n\n**MRCC Senior Loan Fund**\n\nMRCC Senior Loan Fund I, LLC (\"SLF\") is a joint venture with Life Insurance Company of the Southwest (“LSW”), an affiliate of National Life Insurance Company. SLF invests primarily in senior secured loans to middle market companies in the United States. The Company and LSW have each committed $50.0 million of capital to the joint venture. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had made net capital contributions of $42.7 million in SLF with a fair value of $33.1 million, as compared to net capital contributions of $42.7 million in SLF with a fair value of $33.0 million as of March 31, 2024. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company received dividend income from SLF of $0.9 million, consistent with the $0.9 million received during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. SLF’s underlying investments are loans to middle-market borrowers that are generally larger than the rest of MRCC’s portfolio which is focused on lower middle-market companies. SLF’s average mark on the underlying investment portfolio decreased slightly during the quarter, from 88.9% of amortized cost as of March 31, 2024, to 88.3% of amortized cost as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, SLF had total assets of $117.3 million (including investments at fair value of $109.7 million), total liabilities of $51.1 million (including borrowings under the $110.0 million secured revolving credit facility with Capital One, N.A. (the “SLF Credit Facility”) of $50.8 million) and total members’ capital of $66.2 million. As of March 31, 2024, SLF had total assets of $124.9 million (including investments at fair value of $116.4 million), total liabilities of $58.9 million (including borrowings under the SLF Credit Facility of $58.0 million) and total members’ capital of $66.0 million.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure – Adjusted Net Investment Income**\n\nOn a supplemental basis, the Company discloses Adjusted Net Investment Income (including on a per share basis) which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America (“non-GAAP”). Adjusted Net Investment Income represents NII, excluding the net capital gains incentive fee and income taxes. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company. The management agreement with the Company’s advisor provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses for such year. Management believes that Adjusted Net Investment Income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any net capital gains incentive fee as NII does not include gains associated with the capital gains incentive fee.\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation from NII (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted Net Investment Income for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024** | **March 31, 2024**  \n**Amount** | **Per Share Amount** | **Amount** | **Per Share Amount**  \n(unaudited)  \nNet investment income | $ | 6,559 | $ | 0.30 | $ | 5,470 | $ | 0.25  \nNet capital gains incentive fee | — | — | — | —  \nIncome taxes, including excise taxes | 135 | 0.01 | 18 | —  \nAdjusted Net Investment Income | $ | 6,694 | $ | 0.31 | $ | 5,488 | $ | 0.25  \n  \nAdjusted Net Investment Income may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as it is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, Adjusted Net Investment Income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss these operating and financial results on Thursday, August 8, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
