This investment is designed to enhance the company’s financial resilience and support the expansion of its cutting-edge iRWD™ platform. As of November 12, 2024, the Company has invested in approximately 34 Bitcoin.\n\nOff The Chain Capital has made significant investments in OneMedNet through multiple funding rounds, and their expertise regarding Bitcoin has been invaluable. Brian Estes, Chief Investment Officer, of Off The Chain Capital, shared, “We believe Bitcoin will become the monetary layer of the world over the next few decades, much like gold was for over 3000 years. Companies that embrace this vision will gain a strategic advantage over those losing the purchasing power of their treasury reserves due to the debasement of fiat currencies.”\n\nOneMedNet has adopted a Bitcoin on the balance sheet strategy based on the approach Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy (MSTR) pioneered, which reflects a forward-looking approach to corporate treasury management that incorporates digital currencies.\n\nThis investment is part of OneMedNet’s commitment to sustainable growth and innovation that supports the healthcare community through high-quality, compliant regulatory grade clinical data.

The members of the Committee are not full-\ntime employees of the Company and may or may not be accountants or auditors by profession or\nexperts in the fields of accounting or auditing and, in any event, do not serve in such capacity.\nConsequently, it is not the duty of the Committee to conduct audits or to determine that the\nCompany’s financial statements and disclosures are complete and accurate and are in accordance\nwith Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and listing standards of the Nasdaq or\nas mandated under applicable laws, rules and regulations (including the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended).

An affirmative vote of a majority\nof the members of the Committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be required\nin order to approve a Related Party Transaction. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent\nof all of the members of the Committee will be required to approve a Related Party Transaction.\nA Related Party Transaction entered into without pre-approval of the Committee shall not\nbe deemed to violate this policy, or be invalid or unenforceable, so long as the transaction is\nbrought to the Committee as promptly as reasonably practical after it is entered into or after it\nbecomes reasonably apparent that the transaction is covered by this policy.\nVI. REPORTING\nThe Committee shall, on an annual basis and in coordination with the Corporate\nGovernance and Nominating Committee, evaluate its own performance.

If any Company director, officer or employee (to the extent\nthat employees are hired in the future) feels uncomfortable about a situation or has any\ndoubts about whether a situation or course of conduct is consistent with the Company’s\nethical standards, such individuals are advised to seek help from the Company’s Chief\nFinancial Officer.\nII.

          "content": "ONEMEDNET CORPORATION\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\nThis Insider Trading Policy describes the standards of OneMedNet Corporation (the\n“Company”) on trading, and causing the trading of, the Company's securities or securities of certain\nother publicly traded companies while in possession of confidential information. This Policy is\ndivided into two parts: the first part prohibits trading in certain circumstances and applies to all\ndirectors, officers and employees, and their respective immediate family members, of the Company,\nand the second part imposes special additional trading restrictions and applies to all (i) directors of\nthe Company, (ii) officers of the Company (together with the directors, “Company Insiders”) and (iii)\ncertain other employees that the Company may designate from time to time as “Covered Persons”\nbecause of their position, responsibilities or their actual or potential access to material information.\nOne of the principal purposes of the federal securities laws is to prohibit so-called “insider\ntrading.” Simply stated, insider trading occurs when a person uses material nonpublic information\nobtained through involvement with the Company to make decisions to purchase, sell, give away or\notherwise trade the Company's securities or the securities of certain other companies or to provide\nthat information to others outside the Company. The prohibitions against insider trading apply to\ntrades, tips and recommendations by virtually any person, including all persons associated with the\nCompany, if the information involved is “material” and “nonpublic.” These terms are defined in this\nPolicy under Part I, Section 3 below. The prohibitions would apply to any director, officer or\nemployee who buys or sells securities on the basis of material nonpublic information that he or she\nobtained about the Company, its customers, suppliers, partners, competitors or other companies with\nwhich the Company has contractual relationships or may be negotiating transactions.\nI. PART I\nApplicability\nThis Policy applies to all trading or other transactions in (i) the Company's securities,\nincluding common stock, options and any other securities that the Company may issue, such as\npreferred stock, notes, bonds and convertible securities, as well as to derivative securities relating to\nany of the Company's securities, whether or not issued by the Company and (ii) the securities of\ncertain other companies, including common stock, options and other securities issued by those\ncompanies as well as derivative securities relating to any of those companies' securities, where the\nperson trading used information obtained while working for the Company.\nThis Policy applies to all employees and officers of the Company and to all members of the\n1\nCompany's board of directors and their respective family members.\nGeneral Policy: No Trading or Causing Trading While in Possession of Material Nonpublic\nInformation\n(a) No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members may purchase or\nsell, or offer to purchase or sell, any Company security, whether or not issued by the\nCompany, while in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company. (The\nterms “material” and “nonpublic” are defined in Part I, Section 3(a) and (b) below.)\n(b) No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members who knows of\nany material nonpublic information about the Company may communicate that information\nto (“tip”) any other person, including family members and friends, or otherwise disclose such\ninformation without the Company’s authorization.\n(c) No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members may purchase or\nsell any security of any other publicly traded company while in possession of material\nnonpublic information that was obtained in the course of his or her involvement with the\nCompany. No director, officer or employee or any of their immediate family members who\nknows of any such material nonpublic information may communicate that information to, or\ntip, any other person, including family members and friends, or otherwise disclose such\ninformation without the Company's authorization.\n(d) For compliance purposes, you should never trade, tip or recommend securities (or otherwise\ncause the purchase or sale of securities) while in possession of information that you have\nreason to believe is material and nonpublic unless you first consult with, and obtain the\nadvance approval of, the Chief Legal Officer (which is defined in Part I, Section 3(c) below).\n(e) Covered Persons must “pre-clear” all trading in securities of the Company in accordance with\nthe procedures set forth in Part II, Section 3 below.\nDefinitions\n“Material”. Insider trading restrictions come into play only if the information you possess is\n“material.” Materiality, however, involves a relatively low threshold. Information is generally\nregarded as “material” if it has market significance, that is, if its public dissemination is likely to\naffect the market price of securities, or if it otherwise were information that a reasonable investor\nwould want to know before making an investment decision.\nInformation dealing with the following subjects is reasonably likely to be found material in\nparticular situations:\n• significant changes in the Company's prospects;\n• significant write-downs in assets or increases in reserves;\n• developments regarding significant litigation or government agency investigations;\n2\n• liquidity problems;\n• changes in earnings estimates or unusual gains or losses in major operations;\n• major changes in the Company's management or the board of directors;\n• changes in dividends;\n• extraordinary borrowings;\n• major changes in accounting methods or policies;\n• award or loss of a significant contract;\n• cybersecurity risks and incidents, including vulnerabilities and breaches;\n• changes in debt ratings;\n• proposals, plans or agreements, even if preliminary in nature, involving mergers,\nacquisitions, divestitures, recapitalizations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, or\npurchases or sales of substantial assets; and\n• offerings of Company securities.\nMaterial information is not limited to historical facts but may also include projections and\nforecasts. With respect to a future event, such as a merger, acquisition or introduction of a new\nproduct, the point at which negotiations or product development are determined to be material is\ndetermined by balancing the probability that the event will occur against the magnitude of the effect\nthe event would have on a company's operations or stock price should it occur. Thus, information\nconcerning an event that would have a large effect on stock price, such as a merger, may be material\neven if the possibility that the event will occur is relatively small. When in doubt about whether\nparticular nonpublic information is material, you should presume it is material. If you are unsure\nwhether information is material, you should either consult the Chief Legal Officer before making any\ndecision to disclose such information (other than to persons who need to know it) or to trade in or\nrecommend securities to which that information relates or assume that the information is material.\n“Nonpublic”. Insider trading prohibitions come into play only when you possess information\nthat is material and “nonpublic.” The fact that information has been disclosed to a few members of\nthe public does not make it public for insider trading purposes. To be “public” the information must\nhave been disseminated in a manner designed to reach investors generally, and the investors must be\ngiven the opportunity to absorb the information. Even after public disclosure of information about\nthe Company, you must wait until the close of business on the second trading day after the information\nwas publicly disclosed before you can treat the information as public.\nNonpublic information may include:\n• information available to a select group of analysts or brokers or institutional investors;\n• undisclosed facts that are the subject of rumors, even if the rumors are widely circulated;\nand\n• information that has been entrusted to the Company on a confidential basis until a public\nannouncement of the information has been made and enough time has elapsed for the\nmarket to respond to a public announcement of the information (normally two trading\ndays).\nAs with questions of materiality, if you are not sure whether information is considered public,\n3\nyou should either consult with the Chief Legal Officer or assume that the information is nonpublic\nand treat it as confidential.\n“Chief Legal Officer”. The duties of the Chief Legal Officer (or the Company officer serving\nthe equivalent role) include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• assisting with implementation and enforcement of this Policy;\n• circulating this Policy to all employees and ensuring that this Policy is amended as\nnecessary to remain up-to-date with insider trading laws;\n• pre-clearing all trading in securities of the Company by Covered Persons in accordance\nwith the procedures set forth in Part II, Section 3 below; and\n• providing approval of any Rule 10b5-1 plans under Part II, Section 1(c) below and any\nprohibited transactions under Part II, Section 4 below.\n• providing a reporting system with an effective whistleblower protection mechanism.\nExceptions\nThe trading restrictions of this Policy do not apply to the following:\n401(k) Plan. Investing 401(k) plan contributions in a Company stock fund in accordance with\nthe terms of the Company's 401(k) plan. However, any changes in your investment election\nregarding the Company’s stock are subject to trading restrictions under this Policy.\nESPP. Purchasing Company stock through periodic, automatic payroll contributions to the\nCompany's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). However, electing to enroll in the\nESPP, making any changes in your elections under the ESPP and selling any Company stock\nacquired under the ESPP are subject to trading restrictions under this Policy.\nOptions. Exercising stock options granted under the Company's stock option plan for cash or\nthe delivery of previously owned Company stock. However, the sale of any shares issued on\nthe exercise of Company-granted stock options and any cashless exercise of Company-\ngranted stock options are subject to trading restrictions under this Policy.\nViolations of Insider Trading Laws\nPenalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information can be severe, both\nfor individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers and supervisors, and may\ninclude jail terms, criminal fines, civil penalties and civil enforcement injunctions. Given the severity\nof the potential penalties, compliance with this Policy is absolutely mandatory.\nLegal Penalties. A person who violates insider trading laws by engaging in transactions in a\ncompany's securities when he or she has material nonpublic information can be sentenced to\na substantial jail term and required to pay a criminal penalty of several times the amount of\nprofits gained or losses avoided. In addition, a person who tips others may also be liable for\ntransactions by the tippees to whom he or she has disclosed material nonpublic information.\n4\nTippers can be subject to the same penalties and sanctions as the tippees, and the SEC has\nimposed large penalties even when the tipper did not profit from the transaction.\nThe SEC can also seek substantial civil penalties from any person who, at the time of an\ninsider trading violation, “directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such\nviolation,” which would apply to the Company and/or management and supervisory\npersonnel. These control persons may be held liable for up to the greater of $2,301,065 or\nthree times the amount of the profits gained or losses avoided. Even for violations that result\nin a small or no profit, the SEC can seek penalties from a company and/or its management\nand supervisory personnel as control persons.\nCompany-Imposed Penalties. Employees who violate this Policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action by the Company, including dismissal for cause. Any exceptions to the\nPolicy, if permitted, may only be granted by the Chief Legal Officer and must be provided\nbefore any activity contrary to the above requirements takes place.\nInquiries\nIf you have any questions regarding any of the provisions of this Policy, please contact the\nChief Legal Officer.\nII. PART II\nBlackout Periods\nAll Covered Persons (including directors and officers) are prohibited from trading in the\nCompany's securities during blackout periods as defined below.\nQuarterly Blackout Periods. Trading in the Company's securities is prohibited during the\nperiod beginning at the close of the market on two weeks before the end of each fiscal quarter\nand ending at the close of business on the second trading day following the date the\nCompany's financial results are publicly disclosed. During these periods, Covered Persons\ngenerally possess or are presumed to possess material nonpublic information about the\nCompany's financial results.\nOther Blackout Periods. From time to time, other types of material nonpublic information\nregarding the Company (such as negotiation of mergers, acquisitions or dispositions,\ninvestigation and assessment of cybersecurity incidents or new product developments) may\nbe pending and not be publicly disclosed. While such material nonpublic information is\npending, the Company may impose special blackout periods during which Covered Persons\nare prohibited from trading in the Company's securities. If the Company imposes a special\nblackout period, it will notify the Covered Persons affected.\nException. These trading restrictions do not apply to transactions under a pre-existing written\nplan, contract, instruction, or arrangement under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange\n5\nAct of 1934 (an “Approved 10b5-1 Plan”) that meet the following requirements:\n• it has been reviewed and approved by the Chief Legal Officer at least five days in\nadvance of being entered into (or, if revised or amended, such proposed revisions or\namendments have been reviewed and approved by the Chief Legal Officer at least five\ndays in advance of being entered into);\n• it provides that no trades may occur thereunder until expiration of the applicable\ncooling-off period specified in Rule 10b5-1(c)(ii)(B), and no trades occur until after\nthat time. The appropriate cooling-off period will vary based on the status of the\nCovered Person. For directors and officers, the cooling-off period ends on the later of\n(x) ninety days after adoption or certain modifications of the 10b5-1 plan; or (y) two\nbusiness days following disclosure of the Company's financial results for the quarter\nin which the 10b5-1 plan was adopted. For all other Covered Persons, the cooling-off\nperiod ends 30 days after adoption or modification of the 10b5-1 plan. This required\ncooling-off period will apply to the entry into a new 10b5-1 plan and any revision or\nmodification of a 10b5-1 plan;\n• it is entered into in good faith by the Covered Person, and not as part of a plan or\nscheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1, at a time when the Covered Person\nis not in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company; and, if the\nCovered Person is a director or officer, the 10b5-1 plan must include representations\nby the Covered Person certifying to that effect;\n• it gives a third party the discretionary authority to execute such purchases and sales,\noutside the control of the Covered Person, so long as such third party does not possess\nany material nonpublic information about the Company; or explicitly specifies the\nsecurity or securities to be purchased or sold, the number of shares, the prices and/or\ndates of transactions, or other formula(s) describing such transactions; and\n• it is the only outstanding Approved 10b5-1 Plan entered into by the Covered Person\n(subject to the exceptions set out in Rule 10b5-1(c)(ii)(D)).\nIf you are considering entering into, modifying or terminating an Approved 10b5-1 Plan or\nhave any questions regarding Approved Rule 10b5-1 Plans, please contact the Chief Legal\nOfficer. You should consult your own legal and tax advisors before entering into, or\nmodifying or terminating, an Approved 10b5-1 Plan. A trading plan, contract, instruction or\narrangement will not qualify as an Approved 10b5-1 Plan without the prior review and\napproval of the Chief Legal Officer as described above.\nTrading Window\nCovered Persons are permitted to trade in the Company's securities when no blackout period\nis in effect. However, even during this trading window, a Covered Person who is in possession of any\nmaterial nonpublic information should not trade in the Company's securities until the information has\nbeen made publicly available or is no longer material. In addition, the Company may close this trading\nwindow if a special blackout period under Part II, Section 1(b) above is imposed and will re-open the\ntrading window once the special blackout period has ended.\n6\nPre-Clearance of Securities Transactions\nBecause Company Insiders are likely to obtain material nonpublic information on a regular\nbasis, the Company requires all such persons to refrain from trading, even during a trading window\nunder Part II, Section 2 above, without first pre-clearing all transactions in the Company's securities.\nSubject to the exemption in below, no Company Insider may, directly or indirectly, purchase\nor sell (or otherwise make any transfer, gift, pledge or loan of) any Company security at any time\nwithout first obtaining prior approval from the Chief Legal Officer. These procedures also apply to\ntransactions by such person's spouse, other persons living in such person's household and minor\nchildren and to transactions by entities over which such person exercises control.\nThe Chief Legal Officer shall record the date each request is received and the date and time\neach request is approved or disapproved. Unless revoked, a grant of permission will normally remain\nvalid until the close of trading two business days following the day on which it was granted. If the\ntransaction does not occur during the two-day period, pre-clearance of the transaction must be re-\nrequested.\nPre-clearance is not required for purchases and sales of securities under an Approved 10b5-1\nPlan once the applicable cooling-off period has expired. No trades may be made under an Approved\n10b5-1 Plan until expiration of the applicable cooling-off period. With respect to any purchase or sale\nunder an Approved 10b5-1 Plan, the third-party effecting transactions on behalf of the Company\nInsider should be instructed to send duplicate confirmations of all such transactions to the Chief Legal\nOfficer.\nProhibited Transactions\nCompany Insiders are prohibited from trading in the Company's equity securities during a\nblackout period imposed under an “individual account” retirement or pension plan of the Company,\nduring which at least 50% of the plan participants are unable to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire\nor transfer an interest in equity securities of the Company, due to a temporary suspension of trading\nby the Company or the plan fiduciary.\nCovered Persons, including any person's spouse, other persons living in such person's\nhousehold and minor children and entities over which such person exercises control, are prohibited\nfrom engaging in the following transactions in the Company's securities unless advance approval is\nobtained from the Chief Legal Officer:\n• Short-term trading. Company Insiders who purchase Company securities may not sell any\nCompany securities of the same class for at least six months after the purchase;\n• Short sales. Company Insiders/Covered Persons may not sell the Company's securities\nshort;\n• Options trading. Covered Persons may not buy or sell puts or calls or other derivative\nsecurities on the Company's securities;\n• Trading on margin or pledging. Covered Persons may not hold Company securities in a\n7\nmargin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan; and\n• Hedging. Covered Persons may not enter into hedging or monetization transactions or\nsimilar arrangements with respect to Company securities.\nAcknowledgment and Certification\nAll Covered Persons are required to sign the attached acknowledgment and certification.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT AND CERTIFICATION\nRETURN BY [ ] [insert return deadline]\nTO: , Chief Legal Officer\nFROM:\nRE: INSIDER TRADING POLICY OF ONEMEDNET CORPORATION, INC.\nI have received, reviewed and understand the above-referenced Insider Trading Policy and\nundertake, as a condition to my present and continued employment (or, if I am not an employee,\naffiliation with) OneMedNet Corporation, Inc., to comply fully with the policies and procedures\ncontained therein.\nSIGNATURE DATE\nTITLE\n8"

The Company has developed detailed guidelines and\nprocedures for receiving requests for, and ultimately disclosing material information. Please refer\nto the full text of this Regulation FD Policy (the “Policy”) for a complete description of these\nguidelines and procedures. This Policy governs communications with securityholders, analysts,\nand others.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission's (“SEC”) Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure)\n(“Regulation FD”) prohibits the selective disclosure of material nonpublic information to certain\nEnumerated Persons (as defined below). The regulation is intended to eliminate situations in which\na company may disclose important nonpublic information to securities analysts or selected\ninstitutional investors, before disclosing the information to the general public.\nRegulation FD requires that, whenever the Company (or a person acting on its behalf)\nintentionally discloses material nonpublic information to certain specified persons (including\nbroker-dealers, analysts and securityholders), the Company must simultaneously disseminate the\ninformation to the public in a manner consistent with Regulation FD.\nExamples of activities affected by this Policy include:\n• Earnings releases and related conference calls.\n• Speeches, interviews and conferences.\n• Responding to market rumors.\n• Reviewing analyst reports.\n• Referring to or distributing analyst reports on the Company.\n• Analyst and investor visits.\n• Postings on the Company's websites.\n• Social media communications, including through corporate blogs, employee blogs,\nchat boards, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, and any other non-traditional\nmeans of communication.\nIf the Company learns that it (or certain persons acting on its behalf) has unintentionally\ndisclosed material nonpublic information, the Company must promptly publicly disseminate the\ninformation no later than 24 hours after discovering the unintentional disclosure or at the opening\nof trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange (the “Nasdaq”), whichever is later.\nThe Company adopted this Policy to ensure that any persons acting on its behalf comply\nwith Regulation FD. This Policy applies to every director and employee of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, and complements the Company's Insider Trading Policy. This Policy may be\namended, terminated or reinstated at any time in the discretion of the Company's Chief Legal\nOfficer (or the Company executive officer serving such role).\nI. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this Policy is to provide clear guidelines and procedures for receiving\nexternal requests for, and making disclosure of, material information in order to promote the\nCompany's goal of providing accurate and timely communications on a broadly disseminated basis\nto ensure compliance with Regulation FD.\nThe Company's Chief Legal Officer, or such other person reporting to the Chief Legal\nOfficer, shall have the authority to make materiality and distribution determinations covered by\nthis Policy with respect to the information disclosed about the Company. The Chief Legal Officer\nor his/her designee has the authority to interpret and enforce this Policy. All questions about this\nPolicy should be directed to the Chief Legal Officer. Any suspected or known violations of this\nPolicy should be reported immediately to the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Financial Officer.\nIf a Company employee violates this Policy, he or she will be subject to disciplinary action up to\nand including immediate termination of employment.\nThe Chief Legal Officer or his/her designee must pre-approve in writing any deviation\nfrom the policies and procedures outlined in this Policy.\nCompliance with this Policy shall be overseen and documented by the Chief Legal Officer\nat the time of disclosure, including documentation of materiality and distribution determinations,\nwith appropriate back-up documentation showing adherence to the established procedure or the\nbasis for any deviation. The Chief Legal Officer shall document in advance the analysis of why\ninformation to be selectively disclosed is not material. The Chief Legal Officer shall establish a\nsystem to document and track what material information has and has not been made public and\nwhen such information was disclosed to the public.\nII. AUTHORIZED SPOKESPERSONS\nThe only persons authorized to speak on behalf of the Company to securities analysts,\nbroker-dealers, securityholders and any other Enumerated Persons (as described below) are the\nCompany's Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, or other persons specifically\ndesignated by them to speak with respect to a particular topic or purpose (each an “Authorized\nSpokesperson”).\nAt various times, any one of the Authorized Spokespersons may designate others in writing\nto speak on behalf of the Company and/or respond to specific inquiries when necessary due to the\n2\nunavailability of an Authorized Spokesperson or due to the specific nature of the request. While\nothers may be designated in writing from time to time to speak on behalf of the Company, it is\nessential that the Chief Legal Officer and the Investor Relations Department (or the Company\ndepartment serving such role) have knowledge of the information being disseminated by those\nindividuals to facilitate the Company's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory\nrequirements in its external communications.\nTo the extent practicable, Authorized Spokespersons must contact the Chief Legal Officer\nand the Investor Relations Department before having conversations with any Enumerated Persons\nin order to review as much of the substance of the intended communication as possible, including\nslides and other prepared materials. Pre-written speeches, written statements, presentations, and\nother external communications should, to the extent practicable or appropriate, be reviewed by the\nChief Legal Officer (or his or her designee) and a member of the Investor Relations Department.\nIf a director of the Company is an Authorized Spokesperson and plans on speaking\nprivately with one or more of the Company's securityholders, the director shall pre-clear the\ndiscussion topics with the Chief Legal Officer (or his or her designee). Alternatively, the Chief\nLegal Officer must participate in any meeting with such securityholder(s).\nIII. ENUMERATED PERSONS SUBJECT TO REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nRegulation FD prohibits selective disclosure to certain specified persons, including:\n• Broker-dealers and persons associated with them, including investment analysts.\n• Investment advisers, certain institutional investment managers, and their associated\npersons.\n• Investment companies, hedge funds, and affiliated persons.\nThe persons noted above are collectively referred to as “Enumerated Persons.”\nSelective disclosure is also prohibited if made to any securityholder under circumstances in\nwhich it is reasonably foreseeable that the securityholder would purchase or sell the Company's\nsecurities on the basis of the information. In some cases, disclosure of material nonpublic\ninformation to any group can result in a possible Regulation FD violation if the information is not\nwidely disseminated.\nCommunications in the ordinary course of business with customers, suppliers, or strategic\npartners, as well as communications with the press or news organizations, rating agencies, or the\ngovernment, are not covered by the regulation.\nIV. DAY-TO-DAY COMMUNICATIONS\nInquiries from analysts, securityholders and other Enumerated Persons in any department\nother than the Investor Relations Department and the offices of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nFinancial Officer or Chief Legal Officer must be forwarded to Chief Legal Officer or an\n3\nAuthorized Spokesperson. Under no circumstances should any attempt be made to handle these\ninquiries without prior authorization from an Authorized Spokesperson.\nPlanned conversations must include at least one Authorized Spokesperson and should\ninclude a second person. It should be determined in advance whether it is intended that any material\nnonpublic information be disclosed. If so, the material nonpublic information should be disclosed\nprior to or simultaneously with the planned conversation by the issuance of a press release or the\nfiling or “furnishing” of a report on a Form 8-K or both.\nSubject to the following paragraph, the Investor Relations Department will prepare a\nwritten record of each call received and a summary of any discussion and will periodically forward\na copy to the Company's Chief Legal Officer or his or her designee. The Investor Relations\nDepartment may identify the most commonly asked questions and types of information sought and\nmay prepare and circulate written responses to those questions to Authorized Spokespersons and\nupdate such written responses as necessary or appropriate. To the extent the Authorized\nSpokesperson simply follows or refers to the script, the written record of the call only needs to\nidentify the caller and note that the script was followed.\nV. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT COMPANY INFORMATION\nAny time an Authorized Spokesperson determines to disclose or discuss nonpublic\nCompany information with anyone who is or might be an Enumerated Person, the Authorized\nSpokesperson should consult with the Chief Legal Officer and other departments as appropriate to\ndetermine whether the information is material. Information is material if there is a substantial\nlikelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making a decision to buy, sell,\nor hold a security or where the fact is likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the\nsecurity. Both positive and negative information may be material.\nPossible material information or events include, but are not limited to:\n• Earnings information and quarterly results.\n• Guidance/statements on earnings estimates.\n• Mergers, acquisitions, tender offers, joint ventures, or changes in assets.\n• New products, contracts with suppliers, or developments regarding customers or suppliers\n(such as the acquisition or loss of a contract).\n• New investments or financings or developments regarding investments or financings.\n• Changes in auditors or auditor notification that the issuer may no longer rely on an audit\nreport.\n• Cybersecurity risks and incidents, including vulnerabilities and breaches.\n• Events regarding the Company's securities (such as defaults on senior securities, calls of\nsecurities for redemption, repurchase plans, stock splits or changes in dividends, changes\nin the rights of securityholders, public or private sales of additional securities, or\ninformation related to any additional funding).\n• Bankruptcies or receiverships.\n• Regulatory approvals or changes in regulations and any analysis of how they affect the\nCompany.\n4\nThe SEC has explicitly cautioned:\n“When an issuer officially engages in a private discussion with an analyst who is seeking\nguidance about earnings estimates, he or she takes on a high degree of risk under Regulation FD.\nIf the issuer official communicates selectively to the analyst nonpublic information that the\ncompany's anticipated earnings will be higher than, lower than, or even the same as what analysts\nhave been forecasting, the issuer likely will have violated Regulation FD. This is true whether the\ninformation about earnings is communicated expressly or through indirect 'guidance,' the meaning\nof which is apparent though implied. Similarly, an issuer cannot render material information\nimmaterial simply by breaking it into ostensibly non-material pieces.”\nIf the determination is made that the information to be disclosed is material, the information\nmust be disclosed through a press release or current report on Form 8-K or both before or at the\nsame time that the information is disclosed to the Enumerated Person. The public disclosure may\neither disclose the material information or, if it is issued prior to disclosure to the Enumerated\nPerson, may disclose that a conference call and/or webcast will be held to disclose the information.\nThe public must be given adequate advance notice of any conference call and/or webcast and the\nmeans of accessing it.\nEarnings Calls\nAdequate advance public notice must be given of any quarterly earnings conference calls\nand/or webcasts. Notice shall include a press release issued to all major news wires and a posting\non the Company's website with information including the date, time, telephone number, and\nwebcast URL for the earnings call. The press release must also state the period, if any for which a\nreplay of the webcast will be available. Also, a copy of the release must be provided to the Nasdaq\nprior to issuance.\nA quarterly earnings conference call and/or webcast must be open to analysts, media\nrepresentatives, and the general public. Any such conference call must be recorded and kept by the\nCompany for at least three years. The Company will make certain that the date of the conference\ncall and the oral forward-looking statement safe harbor legend is recited at the beginning of the\ncall or webcast and included in the recording so that the date of the information discussed in the\ncall or webcast is unmistakable to listeners of the archived material. This practice reinforces the\nhistorical nature of the information discussed in the call or webcast.\nIn addition, the Company will conspicuously include on its archive site the forward-looking\nstatement safe harbor language for written communications as the archived webcast becomes a\nwritten communication.\nWeb replay of such a call must be available for at least ten days after the conference call.\nGuidance, Quiet Period and Analyst Reports\n5\nThe Company and its employees cannot give earnings guidance in any form (including\n“soft” or indirect guidance) in nonpublic settings. To the extent practicable, analysts will be\nrequested to provide a written agenda or questions in advance to avoid inadvertent disclosures or\nto allow the preparation and simultaneous public release of information the Company is willing to\ndisclose. Two Company representatives, to the extent practicable, including at least one member\nof the Investor Relations Department, must be present during any analyst calls or meetings. Any\nstatements regarding earnings expectations will be limited to press releases and publicly available\nearnings calls.\nWhenever the Company has issued any estimate or comment regarding distributable\nearnings, earnings, or other financial measures (which will ordinarily be issued through a press\nrelease and the filing or furnishing of a Form 8-K), no employee will comment on those projections\nduring the quarter. In response to any question about such information, Authorized Spokespersons\nwill say that it is the Company's policy not to comment on projections during the quarter. The\nCompany will not comment on its intention to update these materials.\nNo Authorized Spokesperson will provide “comfort” with respect to any earnings estimate\nor otherwise “walk the Street” up or down. If any analyst inquires as to the reliability of a\npreviously, publicly disseminated projection, the Authorized Spokesperson should follow the “no\ncomment” policy.\nThe Company will observe a “quiet period” during which the Company shall not comment\non the financial outlook for the Company. Unless the Chief Legal Officer determines otherwise,\nthe quiet period is designated as any time other than the week immediately following the\nCompany's periodic earnings disclosure for which any comment may have been made on the\nCompany's financial outlook.\nAnalyst reports and earnings models may only be reviewed to correct errors that can be\ncorrected by referring to publicly available, historical, factual information or to correct any\nmathematical errors. No other analyst feedback or guidance on earnings models may be\ncommunicated to an analyst. A written record should be kept of any comments provided on an\nanalyst's report. Such reports must be promptly forwarded to the Chief Legal Officer or his or her\ndesignee. Any review of an analyst report may only be done after obtaining the express approval\nof the Chief Legal Officer.\nNo Company employee should distribute (including via a web link) copies of, or refer to,\nselected analysts' reports to anyone outside the Company without the express approval of the Chief\nLegal officer. If approved, any such distribution must include a statement to this effect:\n“This report has been prepared and distributed by an unaffiliated third party and is\nbeing provided to you simply for your information. The Company makes no\nstatement regarding the report or its contents. You should not regard the statements\nmade in the report as being affiliated with or confirmed or denied by the Company\nin any way.”\nAnalyst Meetings/Investment Banker Conferences/Roadshows\n6\nThis Policy will apply to communications between Authorized Spokespersons and\nEnumerated Persons at analyst meetings, investment banker conferences, and roadshows (other\nthan roadshows undertaken in connection with certain public offerings of the Company's\nsecurities). Accordingly, prior to the meeting, conference, or roadshow, the Company will disclose\neither through a press release (accompanied by a current report on Form 8-K), an open conference\ncall, or a webcast, or any combination of these methods, any material information that is not\nalready public and which may be discussed or presented at the meeting, conference, or the\nroadshow.\nIf it is determined that material nonpublic information may have been disclosed\nunintentionally during the meeting, conference, or roadshow, the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief\nFinancial Officer should be notified immediately. If the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief\nFinancial Officer determine[s] that an inadvertent disclosure of material nonpublic information\nhas occurred, a press release (accompanied by a current report on Form 8-K) will be issued\ndisclosing the information no later than either 24 hours after discovery of the unintentional\ndisclosure or prior to the commencement of the next day's trading on the Nasdaq, if later.\nUse of Social Networks\nUse of social networks, including corporate blogs, employee blogs, chat boards, Facebook,\nLinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and any other non-traditional means of communication, to disclose\nmaterial, nonpublic information is considered selective disclosure and would violate this policy.\nPress Release Policy\nPress releases should be reviewed and prepared in accordance with the Company's standard\nprocedures.\nIf a forward-looking statement has been made and there is clear meaning to that statement,\nan employee shall report to the Chief Legal Officer any facts or events which might cause that\nmeaning to change.\nIf a meeting or conference call is held after the issuance of a press release the purpose of\nwhich is to give analysts or major securityholders an opportunity to seek more information or ask\nquestions concerning the information disclosed in a press release, the meeting or call shall be\npreceded by a press release as soon as the meeting or call is planned, which shall announce such\nmeeting or call and provide information including the date, time, telephone number, and webcast\nURL for the meeting or call. The meeting or call shall be open to analysts, media representatives,\nand the general public.\nIf a director, member of management or employee of the Company learns of information\nthat causes him or her to believe that a disclosure may have been misleading or inaccurate when\nmade or may no longer be true, such person should report that information to the Chief Legal\nOfficer.\n7\nRumors; No Comment Policy\nThe Company will not comment on market rumors in the normal course of business. When\nit is learned that rumors about the Company are circulating, Authorized Spokespersons should\nstate only that it is Company policy not to comment on rumors. If the source of the rumor is found\nto be internal, the Chief Legal Officer should be consulted to determine the appropriate response.\nMonitor Trading\nThe trading activity of Company stock will be generally monitored by management for\nunusual trading activity. In addition, Investor Relations will monitor the financial and news media\nfor stories about the Company. Unusual trading volume or price swings may indicate the\ninadvertent disclosure of material information that may need to be remedied by a press release.\nV I. VIOLATIONS OF THIS POLICY\nViolations of Regulation FD are subject to SEC enforcement actions, which may include\nan administrative action seeking a cease-and-desist order, a civil action against the Company or\nan individual seeking an injunction and/or civil monetary penalties. Any violation of this policy\nby a director or employee shall be brought to the attention of the Chief Legal Officer and may\nconstitute grounds for termination of service.\n8"

          "content": "ONEMEDNET CORPORATION\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY\nI. PURPOSE\nAt OneMedNet Corporation (the “Company”) we aim to lead by example. We set high\nstandards for our people at all levels and strive to meet them consistently. Our sound business\nprinciples and practices foster our commitment to ethical behavior, accountability and\ntransparency. We expect our directors, officers and employees to avoid conflicts of interest, that\nis, any activity that interferes with the performance of their duties or that might deprive us of their\nundivided loyalty in business dealings. Conflicts of interest can come up in various ways, even in\nsituations where the transaction may benefit the Company and our stockholders and thus make it\nunclear whether a conflict even exists.\nThis Related Party Transactions Policy (this “Policy”) deals specifically with those\nsituations where the Company (including any of our subsidiaries) is a party to a transaction with a\n“Related Party” (as defined below). A Related Party is a party whose material interest in a\ntransaction could be an actual or potential conflict of interest, or at least create the appearance of\nsuch a conflict. Although our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics addresses this issue generally,\nwe have adopted this Policy to formalize our procedures for the identification, review, and\nconsideration and approval of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Audit\nCommittee”) of any transactions involving the Company and a Related Party. This Policy has been\napproved by our Board of Directors (“Board”). The Audit Committee may recommend future\namendments to this Policy for consideration by our Board as our business evolves.\nII. PERSONS COVERED BY THIS POLICY\nThis Policy is applicable to all members of our Board and director nominees, each of our\nexecutive officers and any person the Company knows to own an interest in the voting power of\nthe Company that gives them significant influence over the Company (each, a “significant\nstockholder”). Any direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the\nCompany’s voting securities is deemed to be a significant stockholder.\nIII. APPROVAL AUTHORITY\nOur “Approval Authority” will be our Audit Committee. In a situation where a member of\nour Audit Committee is a Related Party in the proposed transaction, the other members of the\nAudit Committee or, if requested by the Audit Committee, our Board will be the Approval\nAuthority.\n1\nIV. WHO IS A RELATED PARTY?\nYou are a Related Party if you are:\n1. a person who is, or at any time since the beginning of our last fiscal year was, a\ndirector or executive officer of the Company or a nominee to become a director;\n2. a significant stockholder;\n3. an immediate family member of a director, director nominee, executive officer or\nsignificant stockholder. This includes a person’s spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers and\nfathers-in-law, sons and daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law, and anyone (other than\ndomestic employees or tenant) who share such person’s home; or\n4. entities controlled by a director, director nominee, executive officer or significant\nstockholder or in which a director, director nominee, executive officer or significant stockholder\nhas a greater than 10% beneficial interest.\nV. WHAT TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS ARE COVERED BY THIS POLICY?\nAny transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of\nindebtedness, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) that:\n1. the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or will be a participant;\n2. any Related Party has or will have a direct or indirect material interest; and\n3. the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any\nfiscal year (or the reduced threshold based on Smaller Reporting Company status, if applicable).\nAny transaction that meets the above criteria is referred to as a “Related Party Transaction.”\nVI. IDENTIFYING RELATED PARTIES\nWe have established a process to identify any Related Party to assist us in enforcing this\nPolicy.\na. Directors and Executive Officers\nOur finance team or compliance or legal department will collect, at least annually, the\nfollowing information from each of our directors and executive officers (typically in the annual\nDirectors’ and Officers’ Questionnaire):\n1. A list of all entities in which they serve as a director or executive officer, or in\nwhich they have 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest.\n2. A list of all their immediate family members, and for each immediate family\nmember listed:\n2\n• whether they are (a) an executive officer of any entity, or (b) employed by the\nCompany’s independent auditor (or an affiliate, member firm or other entity\nassociated with our independent auditor), and if so, the name of their employer and\njob title or a brief job description; and\n• all entities in which they serve as a director or in which they are a significant\nstockholder.\nThis list will also include the name of each charitable or non-profit organization for which\neach director, executive officer and any immediate family member is a major fundraiser or\notherwise serves as a director or trustee, or in a similar capacity.\nDirectors and executive officers are expected to notify our finance team or compliance or\nlegal department of any updates to the list of Related Parties, including updates to their\nemployment and relationships with charitable organizations.\nb. Significant Stockholders\nWhen the Company learns that a person has become a significant stockholder, our finance\nteam or compliance or legal department will examine relevant filings with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) (to the extent such information is available) to determine (a) if\nthe person is an individual, the same information requested of directors and executive officers\nunder this Policy, and (b) if the person is a firm, corporation or other entity, a list of principals or\nexecutive officers of such firm, corporation or entity.\nVII. APPROVAL PROCESS\na. Advance Approval\nAny transaction the Company intends to undertake with a Related Party, irrespective of the\namounts involved (unless the transaction is subject to standing pre-approval as provided below or\npursuant to a resolution adopted by the Approval Authority), must be submitted to our Chief Legal\nOfficer (or the officer serving such role at the Company) for his or her determination of the\napprovals required under this Policy. The Chief Legal Officer will refer to the Approval Authority\nany Related Party Transaction, and any other transaction he or she determines should be considered\nfor evaluation by the Approval Authority, consistent with the purpose of this Policy. The Chief\nLegal Officer may do so irrespective of any pre-approval or other technical exemption from this\nPolicy.\nThe legal or compliance department or finance team will provide the Approval Authority\nwith all relevant information available about the proposed transaction, including:\n1. the Related Party’s relationship to the Company and interest in the transaction;\n2. the material facts of the proposed transaction, including the anticipated aggregate\ndollar value of the transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the largest amount of principal\noutstanding at any time during the current fiscal year plus all amounts of interest payable on it\nduring the fiscal year;\n3\n3. the rationale for the proposed transaction; and\n4. any other relevant information with respect to the proposed transaction.\nIn deciding whether to approve a proposed transaction, the Approval Authority may take\ninto account any relevant information and considerations, including the impact on a director’s\nindependence if the Related Party is a director, their immediate family member or an entity with\nwhich a director is affiliated. The Approval Authority may impose such conditions as it deems\nappropriate on the Company or on the Related Party in connection with approving the proposed\ntransaction.\nThe Approval Authority will convey the decision, including any conditions imposed on the\ntransaction, to our Chief Legal Officer, who then will convey the decision to the appropriate people\nwithin the Company.\nb. Review of Ongoing Transactions\nAt least annually, the Approval Authority will review any previously approved or ratified\ntransactions with Related Parties that remain ongoing, and that have a remaining term of more than\nsix months and remaining amounts payable to or receivable from us of more than $120,000 during\nthe fiscal year (or the reduced threshold based on Smaller Reporting Company status, if\napplicable). Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, the Approval Authority will determine\nwhether it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue, modify or\nterminate the transaction.\nc. Ratification\nMembers of our finance team will produce quarterly reports of any amounts paid or payable\nto, or received or receivable from, any Related Party. These reports will be provided (a) to our\nlegal or compliance department and used to determine whether there are any Related Party\nTransactions or other transactions with Related Parties that were not previously approved or\npreviously ratified under this Policy, and (b) to our Chief Legal Officer for appropriate reporting\nin our periodic reports.\nIf the Chief Legal Officer learns of a transaction with a Related Party that required but did\nnot receive approval or ratification under this Policy, he or she will promptly submit the transaction\nto the Approval Authority. The Approval Authority will undertake the review described above.\nBased on the conclusions reached, the Approval Authority will evaluate all options, including but\nnot limited to ratification, amendment or termination of the transaction with the Related Party, and\ndetermine whether disciplinary action is appropriate.\nA transaction with a Related Party entered into without pre-approval of the Approval\nAuthority will not be deemed to violate this Policy, or be invalid or unenforceable, provided that\nthe transaction is brought to the Approval Authority as promptly as reasonably practical after it is\nentered into, or after it becomes reasonably apparent that the transaction is covered by this Policy.\nd. Standing Pre-Approval for Certain Related Party Transactions\n4\nUnless there are special or unusual benefits to the Related Party in a proposed transaction,\nthe following categories of Related Party Transactions do not need to be presented to the Approval\nAuthority for review and approval under this Policy:\n1. Employment of executive officers: Any employment by us of an executive officer\nif:\n• the executive officer is a “named executive officer” whose compensation\nmust be reported in our proxy statement; or\n• the executive officer is not an immediate family member of another\nexecutive officer or director, the related compensation would be reported in\nour proxy if the executive officer were a “named executive officer,” and the\nCompany’s Board;\n2. Director compensation: Any compensation paid to a director (in such capacity) if\nthe compensation is required to be reported in our proxy statement;\n3. Transactions where all stockholders receive proportional benefits: Any transaction\nin which the Related Party’s interest arises solely from the ownership of our capital shares and all\nholders of our capital shares receive the same benefit on a pro rata basis (e.g., dividends);\n4. Ordinary-course expenses, advances and reimbursements: Ordinary-course\nbusiness travel and expenses, advances and reimbursements; and\n5. Indemnification: Indemnification payments and other payments made pursuant to\n(a) directors and officers insurance policies, (b) our formation document or charter (as may be\namended and/or restated from time to time), and/or (c) any other policy or agreement approved by\nthe Board.\n5"
