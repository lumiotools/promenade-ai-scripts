As of September 30, 2024, there were 732 manachised hotels under development in our pipeline.\n\nThe average daily room rate4 (“ADR”) was RMB456 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB495 for the same period of 2023 and RMB441 for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe occupancy rate4 was 80.3% for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 82.4% for the same period of 2023 and 78.4% for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe revenue per available room4 (“RevPAR”) was RMB380 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB424 for the same period of 2023 and RMB359 for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe GMV5 generated from our retail business was RMB566 million for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 107.7% year-over-year.\n\n“We delivered another strong performance for the third quarter of 2024, driven by synergistic growth across our hotel and retail businesses,” said Mr. Haijun Wang, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Atour. “We accelerated the expansion of our hotel network, with 140 new hotel openings during the quarter, once again setting a quarterly record. As of the end of the third quarter, we had a total of 1,533 hotels in operation, representing a 37.9% year-over-year increase. In October, we officially unveiled our new upscale brand, SAVHE Hotel, strengthening our presence in the upscale market with a long-term approach to growth and branding. Our RevPAR remained at a healthy level this quarter despite evolving market environments and last year’s high comparison base, reaching RMB380. Additionally, our retail business sustained its robust growth momentum, with GMV increasing by 107.7% year-over-year to RMB566 million this quarter, as driven by Atour Planet’s effective and systematic deep sleep idea.\n\nLooking ahead, we will remain committed to executing our core ‘Chinese Experience’ strategy, consistently innovating and elevating our hotel offerings, strengthening our service capabilities to deliver a superior customer experience, and driving high-quality growth in our retail business. We are confident these efforts will holistically amplify our brand influence, reinforcing Atour’s distinctive competitive edges,” concluded Mr. Wang.\n\n**Third Quarter of 2024 Unaudited Financial Results**  \n---  \n(RMB in thousands)| **Q3 2023**| **Q3 2024**  \n**Revenues:**  \nManachised hotels| 781,112| 1,179,211  \nLeased hotels| 238,190| 189,531  \nRetail| 235,124| 479,704  \nOthers| 39,678| 50,136  \n**Net revenues**| **1,294,104**| **1,898,582**  \n  \n**Net revenues.** Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 46.7% to RMB1,899 million (US$271 million) from RMB1,294 million for the same period of 2023, mainly driven by the growth in manachised hotel and retail businesses.\n\n  * _Manachised hotels._ Revenues from our manachised hotels for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 51.0% to RMB1,179 million (US$168 million) from RMB781 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by our ongoing hotel network expansion and the rapid growth of our supply chain business. The total number of our manachised hotels increased from 1,080 as of September 30, 2023 to 1,504 as of September 30, 2024. RevPAR of our manachised hotels was RMB376 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB418 for the same period of 2023.\n\n  * _Leased hotels._ Revenues from our leased hotels for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 20.4% to RMB190 million (US$27 million) from RMB238 million for the same period of 2023, primarily due to the decrease in the number of leased hotels as a result of our product mix optimization, as well as the decrease in RevPAR. RevPAR of our leased hotels was RMB527 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB571 for the same period of 2023.\n\n  * _Retail._ Revenues from retail for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 104.0% to RMB480 million (US$68 million) from RMB235 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was driven by widespread recognition of our retail brands and effective product innovation and development as we successfully broadened our product offerings.\n\n  * _Others._ Revenues from others for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 26.4% to RMB50 million (US$7 million) from RMB40 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was driven by our fast-growing membership business.\n\n\n\n\n**Q3 2023**| **Q3 2024**  \n---|---  \n(RMB in thousands)  \n**Operating costs and expenses:**  \nHotel operating costs| (616,537)| (876,197)  \nRetail costs| (112,209)| (227,027)  \nOther operating costs| (18,473)| (7,814)  \nSelling and marketing expenses| (112,273)| (218,433)  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| (79,382)| (81,977)  \nTechnology and development expenses| (20,367)| (30,240)  \n**Total operating costs and expenses**| **(959,241)**| **(1,441,688)**  \n  \n**Operating costs and expenses** for the third quarter of 2024 were RMB1,442 million (US$205 million), including RMB3 million share-based compensation expenses, compared with RMB959 million, including RMB10 million share-based compensation expenses for the same period of 2023.\n\n  * _Hotel operating costs_ for the third quarter of 2024 were RMB876 million (US$125 million), compared with RMB617 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was mainly due to the increase in variable costs, such as supply chain costs, associated with our ongoing hotel network expansion. Hotel operating costs accounted for 64.0% of manachised and leased hotels’ revenues for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 60.5% for the same period of 2023. This increase was due to a decrease in RevPAR attributable to the high base effect in the same period of 2023, as well as an increased share of revenues generated by the lower-margin supply chain business.\n\n  * _Retail costs_ for the third quarter of 2024 were RMB227 million (US$32 million), compared with RMB112 million for the same period of 2023.

This increase was mainly due to our enhanced investment in brand recognition and the effective development of online channels, aligned with the growth of our retail business. Selling and marketing expenses accounted for 11.5% of net revenues for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 8.7% for the same period of 2023.\n\n  * _General and administrative expenses_ for the third quarter of 2024 were RMB82 million (US$12 million), including RMB3 million share-based compensation expenses, compared with RMB79 million, including RMB9 million share-based compensation expenses for the same period of 2023. Excluding the share-based compensation expenses, this increase was primarily due to an increase in labor costs. General and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation expenses, accounted for 4.2% of net revenues for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 5.4% for the same period of 2023.\n\n  * _Technology and development expenses_ for the third quarter of 2024 were RMB30 million (US$4 million), compared with RMB20 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was mainly attributable to our increased investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our expanding hotel network and retail business and improve customer experience. Technology and development expenses accounted for 1.6% of net revenues for both the third quarters of 2024 and the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n**Other operating income, net** for the third quarter of 2024 was RMB35 million (US$5 million) income, compared with RMB6 million income for the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the increase in government subsidies.\n\n**Income from operations** for the third quarter of 2024 was RMB492 million (US$70 million), compared with RMB341 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Income tax expense** for the third quarter of 2024 was RMB143 million (US$20 million), compared with RMB94 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net income** for the third quarter of 2024 was RMB381 million (US$54 million), representing an increase of 45.3% year-over-year compared with RMB262 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Adjusted net income (non-GAAP)** for the third quarter of 2024 was RMB384 million (US$55 million), representing an increase of 41.2% year-over-year compared with RMB272 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Basic and diluted income per share/American depositary share (ADS).** For the third quarter of 2024, basic income per share was RMB0.93 (US$0.13), and diluted income per share was RMB0.92 (US$0.13).

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this release.\n\nThe Company believes that EBITDA is widely used by other companies in the hospitality industry and may be used by investors as a measure of the financial performance. Given the significant investments that the Company has made in leasehold improvements and other fixed assets of leased hotels, depreciation and amortization comprises a significant portion of the Company’s cost structure. The Company believes that EBITDA will provide investors with a useful tool for comparability between periods because it eliminates depreciation and amortization attributable to capital expenditures. Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses, as the investors can better understand the Company’s performance and compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis, excluding share-based compensation expenses, which are not expected to result in cash payment. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used regularly by Company management in financial and operational decision-making. The accompanying tables provide more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe use of these non-GAAP measures has certain limitations, as the excluded items have been and will be incurred, and are not reflected in the presentation of these non-GAAP measures. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of the results.

As of June 30, 2024, there were 712 manachised hotels under development in our pipeline.\n\nThe average daily room rate4 (“ADR”) was RMB441 for the second quarter of 2024, compared with RMB475 for the same period of 2023 and RMB430 for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe occupancy rate4 was 78.4% for the second quarter of 2024, compared with 77.1% for the same period of 2023 and 73.3% for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe revenue per available room4 (“RevPAR”) was RMB359 for the second quarter of 2024, compared with RMB384 for the same period of 2023 and RMB328 for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe GMV5 generated from our retail business was RMB620 million for the second quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 157.6% year-over-year.\n\n“Driven by the synergistic growth of our accommodation and retail businesses, we delivered a strong performance for the second quarter of 2024, further solidifying our industry leadership,” said Mr. Haijun Wang, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Atour. “Our hotel network expansion maintained its vigorous momentum with 123 new openings in the second quarter, representing a new quarterly record. As of the end of the second quarter, we had a total of 1,412 hotels in operation, representing a 36.6% year-over-year increase, which accelerates the progress toward our goal of 2,000 premier hotels nationwide by 2025. In the second quarter, while RevPAR declined year-over-year primarily due to a high base effect, our occupancy rate remained solid, reaching 101.7% of 2023’s level for the same period. Additionally, our retail business continued to deliver exceptional performance in the second quarter, with GMV up by 157.6% year-over-year to RMB620 million, as a result of our efficient new product development and ongoing product offering expansion.\n\n“Looking ahead to the second half of 2024, we will continue propelling progress with our deep understanding of and ability to fulfill customer needs. By consistently enhancing the ‘Chinese Experience’, we will promote comprehensive, high-quality growth across our Group’s businesses and brand portfolio,” concluded Mr. Wang. \n\n**Second Quarter of 2024 Unaudited Financial Results**\n\n(RMB in thousands) | **Q2 2023** | **Q2 2024**  \n---|---|---  \n**Revenues:**  \nManachised hotels | 626,483 | 1,026,979  \nLeased hotels | 219,524 | 180,333  \nRetail | 211,648 | 536,734  \nOthers | 35,054 | 53,001  \n**Net revenues** | **1,092,709** | **1,797,047**  \n  \n**Net revenues.** Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2024 increased by 64.5% to RMB1,797 million (US$247 million) from RMB1,093 million for the same period of 2023, mainly driven by the growth in manachised hotel and retail businesses.\n\n  * _Manachised hotels._ Revenues from our manachised hotels for the second quarter of 2024 increased by 63.9% to RMB1,027 million (US$141 million) from RMB626 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by our ongoing hotel network expansion and the rapid growth of our supply chain business. The total number of our manachised hotels increased from 1,001 as of June 30, 2023 to 1,382 as of June 30, 2024. RevPAR of our manachised hotels was RMB355 for the second quarter of 2024, compared with RMB377 for the same period of 2023. \n  * _Leased hotels._ Revenues from our leased hotels for the second quarter of 2024 decreased by 17.9% to RMB180 million (US$25 million) from RMB220 million for the same period of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the number of leased hotels as a result of our product mix optimization, as well as a decrease in RevPAR. RevPAR of our leased hotels was RMB503 for the second quarter of 2024, compared with RMB537 for the same period of 2023. \n  * _Retail._ Revenues from retail for the second quarter of 2024 increased by 153.6% to RMB537 million (US$74 million) from RMB212 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was driven by widespread recognition of our retail brands and effective product innovation and development as we successfully broadened our range of product offerings. In the second quarter of 2024, comforters sales accounted for over 20% of retail revenues, further accelerating the growth of our retail business. \n  * _Others._ Revenues from others for the second quarter of 2024 increased by 51.2% to RMB53 million (US$7 million) from RMB35 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was driven by our fast-growing membership business.\n\n\n\n**Q2 2023** | **Q2 2024**  \n---|---  \n(RMB in thousands)  \n**Operating costs and expenses:**  \nHotel operating costs | (509,513 | ) | (775,753 | )  \nRetail costs | (107,560 | ) | (265,003 | )  \nOther operating costs | (13,261 | ) | (9,918 | )  \nSelling and marketing expenses | (94,400 | ) | (224,607 | )  \nGeneral and administrative expenses | (73,450 | ) | (91,488 | )  \nTechnology and development expenses | (17,831 | ) | (32,952 | )  \n**Total operating costs and expenses** | **(816,015** | **)** | **(1,399,721** | **)**  \n  \n**Operating costs and expenses** for the second quarter of 2024 were RMB1,400 million (US$193 million), including RMB24 million share-based compensation expenses, compared with RMB816 million, including RMB10 million share-based compensation expenses for the same period of 2023.\n\n  * _Hotel operating costs_ for the second quarter of 2024 were RMB776 million (US$107 million), compared with RMB510 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was mainly due to the increase in variable costs, such as supply chain costs, associated with our ongoing hotel network expansion. Hotel operating costs accounted for 64.3% of manachised and leased hotels’ revenues for the second quarter of 2024, compared with 60.2% for the same period of 2023. This increase was due to a decrease in RevPAR attributable to the high base effect in the same period of 2023, as well as an increased share of revenue generated by the lower-margin supply chain business. \n  * _Retail costs_ for the second quarter of 2024 were RMB265 million (US$36 million), compared with RMB108 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was associated with the rapid growth of our retail business. Retail costs accounted for 49.4% of retail revenues for the second quarter of 2024, compared with 50.8% for the same period of 2023. This decrease was attributable to an increasing contribution from higher-margin online sales. \n  * _Other operating costs_ for the second quarter of 2024 were RMB10 million (US$1.4 million), compared with RMB13 million for the same period of 2023. \n  * _Selling and marketing expenses_ for the second quarter of 2024 were RMB225 million (US$31 million), compared with RMB94 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was mainly due to our enhanced investment in brand recognition and the effective development of online channels, aligned with the growth of our retail business. Selling and marketing expenses accounted for 12.5% of net revenues for the second quarter of 2024, compared with 8.6% for the same period of 2023. \n\n\n  * _General and administrative expenses_ for the second quarter of 2024 were RMB91 million (US$13 million), including RMB15 million share-based compensation expenses, compared with RMB73 million, including RMB9 million share-based compensation expenses for the same period of 2023. Excluding the share-based compensation expenses, this increase was primarily due to an increase in labor costs. General and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation expenses, accounted for 4.2% of net revenues for the second quarter of 2024, compared with 5.9% for the same period of 2023. \n  * _Technology and development expenses_ for the second quarter of 2024 were RMB33 million (US$5 million), compared with RMB18 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was mainly attributable to our increased investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our expanding hotel network and retail business and improve customer experience. Technology and development expenses accounted for 1.8% of net revenues for the second quarter of 2024, compared with 1.6% for the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Other operating income****(expenses), net** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB6 million (US$0.8 million) expenses, compared with RMB30 million income for the same period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in government subsidies.\n\n**Income from operations** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB391 million (US$54 million), compared with RMB307 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Income tax expense** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB110 million (US$15 million), compared with RMB79 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net income** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB304 million (US$42 million), representing an increase of 27.1% year-over-year compared with RMB239 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Adjusted net income (non-GAAP)** for the second quarter of 2024 was RMB328 million (US$45 million), representing an increase of 31.6% year-over-year compared with RMB249 million for the same period of 2023.\n\n**Basic and diluted income****per share/American depositary share (ADS).** For the second quarter of 2024, basic income per share was RMB0.73 (US$0.10), and diluted income per share was RMB0.73 (US$0.10).

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this release.\n\nThe Company believes that EBITDA is widely used by other companies in the hospitality industry and may be used by investors as a measure of the financial performance. Given the significant investments that the Company has made in leasehold improvements and other fixed assets of leased hotels, depreciation and amortization comprises a significant portion of the Company’s cost structure. The Company believes that EBITDA will provide investors with a useful tool for comparability between periods because it eliminates depreciation and amortization attributable to capital expenditures. Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses, as the investors can better understand the Company’s performance and compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis, excluding share-based compensation expenses, which are not expected to result in cash payment. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used regularly by Company management in financial and operational decision-making. The accompanying tables provide more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe use of these non-GAAP measures has certain limitations, as the excluded items have been and will be incurred, and are not reflected in the presentation of these non-GAAP measures. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of the results. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing the disclosure of the relevant items both in its reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and in its consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the performance of the Company.\n\nIn addition, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures utilized by other companies, as these companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner as the Company does.\n\n**About Atour Lifestyle Holdings Limited**\n\nAtour Lifestyle Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: ATAT) is a leading hospitality and lifestyle company in China, with a distinct portfolio of lifestyle hotel brands.
