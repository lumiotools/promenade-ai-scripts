(Nasdaq: WULF) (“TeraWulf” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of vertically integrated, next-generation digital infrastructure powered by predominantly zero-carbon energy, today announced its unaudited interim financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and provided an operational update.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Operational and Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Self-mined 442 bitcoin at the Lake Mariner Facility.\n  * Revenue increased to $27.1 million in Q3 2024 compared to $19.0 million in Q3 2023.\n  * Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) increased to $14.7 million in Q3 2024 compared to $8.3 million in Q3 2023.\n  * Total self-mining hashrate capacity of 10.0 EH/s as of September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 100.0% relative to the same prior year period.\n\n\n\n**Key GAAP Metrics ($ in thousands)** | **Three Months Ended Q3 2024** | **Three Months Ended Q3 2023** | **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \nRevenue | $ | 27,059  | $ | 18,955  | 42.8 | %  \nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) | $ | 14,660  | $ | 8,268  | 77.3 | %  \nCost of revenue as % of revenue | 54.2 | % | 43.6 | % | 24.3 | %  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Non-GAAP Operational and Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Self-mined 555 bitcoin across the Lake Mariner and Nautilus Cryptomine facilities, which represented a 43.4% decrease relative to in Q3 2023.\n  * Total value of bitcoin self-mined1 of $33.9 million in Q3 2024 compared to $27.6 million in Q3 2023.\n  * Power cost per bitcoin self-mined increased year-over-year, to $30,448 per bitcoin in Q3 2024 from $9,322 per bitcoin in Q3 2023, due to an approximate doubling in network difficulty and the bitcoin reward halving in April 2024.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $6.0 million in Q3 2024, an decrease of 33.6% from $9.0 million in Q3 2023.\n\n\n\n**Key Non-GAAP Metrics 2** | **Three Months Ended Q3 2024** | **Three Months Ended Q3 2023** | **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \nBitcoin Self-Mined3 |  555 |  981 | (43.4 | ) %  \nValue per Bitcoin Self-Mined4 | $ | 61,075 | $ | 28,104 | 117.3 | %  \nPower Cost per Bitcoin Self-Mined5 | $ | 30,448 | $ | 9,322 | 226.6 | %  \nAvg.

Accordingly, operating results of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility are not reflected in revenue, cost of revenue or cost of operations lines in TeraWulf’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses these metrics as indicators of operational progress and effectiveness and believes they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to provide comparisons to peer companies. All figures except Bitcoin Self-Mined are estimates.3 Excludes BTC earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility and TeraWulf’s net share of BTC produced at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.4 Computed as the weighted-average opening price of BTC on each respective day the Self-Mined Bitcoin is earned.5 The Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 calculations excludes 0 and 14 bitcoin, respectively, earned via hosting profit share.6 While nameplate inventory for TeraWulf’s two facilities was 10.0 EH/s and 5.5 EH/s as of Q3 2024 and Q3 2023, respectively, actual monthly hash rate performance depends on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) performance tuning to increase efficiency and maximize margin, scheduled outages (scopes to improve reliability or performance), unscheduled outages, curtailment due to participation in various cash generating demand response programs, derate of ASICS due to adverse weather and ASIC maintenance and repair. Average operating hash rate for Q3 2023 also includes hash rate related to a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter marked a pivotal turning point for TeraWulf, as we delivered strong results across our strategic, financial, and operational objectives,” said Paul Prager, Chairman and CEO of TeraWulf. “The sale of our interest in the Nautilus joint venture not only generated a substantial return but also sharpened our focus on scaling high-performance computing at Lake Mariner. Securing an expanded ground lease with exclusive rights to 750 MW of infrastructure capacity is a significant milestone in our growth strategy. Combined with the success of our $500.0 million capital raise, we are exceptionally well-positioned to seize new opportunities in both Bitcoin mining and HPC hosting as we enter 2025.”\n\nPrager continued, “We are excited about the surging demand for high-performance computing and the unique opportunity it presents for TeraWulf. Our power-ready energy assets offer a competitive advantage unmatched in the industry, providing a strong foundation as we scale our energy and digital infrastructure capabilities. We are focused on securing a customer contract by year-end, and remain dedicated to delivering outstanding value for our shareholders.”\n\nPatrick Fleury, TeraWulf’s CFO added, \"We are fully funded to execute our growth plans through the first half of 2025. In October, we secured $500.0 million in convertible notes financing, using $60 million for a capped call to neutralize dilution up to a share price of $12.80. Simultaneously, we repurchased $115.0 million in common stock, resulting in no effective dilution until the stock exceeds $18.00 per share. This strategic move reinforces our commitment to shareholder value and positions us for strong growth ahead.\"\n\n**Operations Update**\n\nTeraWulf's current operational Bitcoin mining capacity includes approximately 195 MW at the Lake Mariner Facility. With the ongoing reinstallation of XP miners from Nautilus, the Company expects to increase its total self-mining hash rate to approximately 8.7 EH/s in the near term.\n\nOn the WULF Compute front, TeraWulf is actively expanding its HPC hosting infrastructure at Lake Mariner. Notable milestones include the successful completion of a 2.5 MW HPC proof-of-concept project, specifically designed to support both current and next-generation GPU technologies. The construction of CB-1, a 20 MW Tier 3-grade HPC hosting facility, is progressing on schedule and is expected to be completed by Q1 2025. Preparations for CB-2, a 50 MW HPC hosting facility, are also well advanced, with key components already secured, positioning the Company for a timely launch by the end of Q2 2025.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 increased 42.8% to $27.1 million as compared to $19.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. This increase is attributable to a significant growth in operating self-mining hash rate as well as a higher average bitcoin price relative to the third quarter of 2023. Notably, revenue and expenses reported in the TeraWulf GAAP income statement excludes revenue and expenses from the Nautilus joint venture; the net financial impact of the Nautilus joint venture is captured within equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) in the third quarter of 2024 increased 77.3% to $14.7 million compared to $8.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) as a percentage of revenue increased to 54.2% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 43.6% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to an approximate doubling in network difficulty and the bitcoin reward halving in April 2024, partially offset by an 62.0% increase in average operating hash rate and 117.3% increase in average value per bitcoin self-mined year-over-year.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repaid $75.8 million of debt to fully pay down the remaining balance on its Term Loans ahead of maturity.\n\n**About TeraWulf**\n\nTeraWulf develops, owns, and operates environmentally sustainable, next-generation data center infrastructure in the United States, specifically designed for Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. Led by a team of seasoned energy entrepreneurs, the Company owns and operates the Lake Mariner facility situated on the expansive site of a now retired coal plant in Western New York. Currently, TeraWulf generates revenue primarily through Bitcoin mining, leveraging predominantly zero-carbon energy sources, including hydroelectric and nuclear power. Committed to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles that align with its business objectives, TeraWulf aims to deliver industry-leading economics in mining and data center operations at an industrial scale.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) impacts of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (ii) preferred stock dividends, stock-based compensation expense and related party expense to be settled with respect to common stock, all of which are non-cash items that the Company believes are not reflective of its general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus; (iv) other income which is related to interest income or income for which management believes is not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating activities; (v) loss on extinguishment of debt, which is not reflective of the Company’s general business performance; and (vi) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, which is not be applicable to the Company’s future business activities. The Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA also includes the impact of distributions from investee received in bitcoin related to a return on the Nautilus investment, which management believes, in conjunction with excluding the impact of equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, is reflective of assets available for the Company’s use in its ongoing operations as a result of its investment in Nautilus.\n\nManagement believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the foregoing to be the case even though some of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management does not believe any of such items are normal operating expenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenues). For example, the Company expects that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, directors and consultants. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenue.\n\nThe Company's Adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating loss or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Although management utilizes internally and presents Adjusted EBITDA, the Company only utilizes that measure supplementally and does not consider it to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by U.S. GAAP financial results. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure (i.e., net loss attributable to common stockholders) for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet loss attributable to common stockholders | $ | (23,033 | ) | $ | (19,371 | ) | $ | (44,100 | ) | $ | (63,692 | )  \nAdjustments to reconcile net loss attributable to common stockholders to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:  \nPreferred stock dividends | 300 | 272 | 878 | 796  \nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax | — | 68 | — | 106  \nEquity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax | 2,679 | (850 | ) | (3,363 | ) | 12,613  \nDistributions from investee, related to Nautilus | 3,395 | 6,739 | 22,482 | 11,682  \nIncome tax benefit | — | — | — | —  \nOther income | (339 | ) | (59 | ) | (1,286 | ) | (113 | )  \nLoss on extinguishment of debt | 4,273 | — | 6,300 | —  \nInterest expense | 409 | 10,251 | 16,779 | 25,535  \nDepreciation | 15,643 | 8,224 | 44,864 | 20,085  \nAmortization of right-of-use asset | 252 | 249 | 755 | 750  \nStock-based compensation expense | 2,408 | 1,413 | 14,181 | 4,023  \nRelated party expense to be settled with respect to common stock | — | 2,085 | — | 2,502  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 5,987 | $ | 9,021 | $ | 57,490 | $ | 14,287  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/6c3313b8-becc-419c-918e-1f19edf5b4fa/small/terawulf-final-jpg-1-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6c3313b8-becc-419c-918e-1f19edf5b4fa)\n\nSource: TeraWulf Inc. \n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [ Company Profile ](/company-information)\n  * [ Contacts ](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ RSS News Feed ](https://investors.terawulf.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

Accordingly, operating results of the\nNautilus Cryptomine Facility are not reflected in revenue, cost of revenue or cost of\noperations lines in TeraWulf’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The\nCompany uses these metrics as indicators of operational progress and effectiveness and\nbelieves they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to provide comparisons to\npeer companies.

Average operating hash rate for Q3 2023 also includes hash rate related to a hosting\nagreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility.\nManagement Commentary\n“The third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter marked a pivotal turning point for\nTeraWulf, as we delivered strong results across our strategic, financial, and operational\nobjectives,” said Paul Prager, Chairman and CEO of TeraWulf. “The sale of our interest in\nthe Nautilus joint venture not only generated a substantial return but also sharpened our\nfocus on scaling high-performance computing at Lake Mariner. Securing an expanded\nground lease with exclusive rights to 750 MW of infrastructure capacity is a significant\nmilestone in our growth strategy. Combined with the success of our $500.0 million capital\nraise, we are exceptionally well-positioned to seize new opportunities in both Bitcoin mining\nand HPC hosting as we enter 2025.”\nPrager continued, “We are excited about the surging demand for high-performance\ncomputing and the unique opportunity it presents for TeraWulf. Our power-ready energy\nassets offer a competitive advantage unmatched in the industry, providing a strong\nfoundation as we scale our energy and digital infrastructure capabilities. We are focused on\nsecuring a customer contract by year-end, and remain dedicated to delivering outstanding\nvalue for our shareholders.”\nPatrick Fleury, TeraWulf’s CFO added, \"We are fully funded to execute our growth plans\nthrough the first half of 2025. In October, we secured $500.0 million in convertible notes\nfinancing, using $60 million for a capped call to neutralize dilution up to a share price of\n$12.80. Simultaneously, we repurchased $115.0 million in common stock, resulting in no\neffective dilution until the stock exceeds $18.00 per share. This strategic move reinforces\nour commitment to shareholder value and positions us for strong growth ahead.\"\nOperations Update\nTeraWulf's current operational Bitcoin mining capacity includes approximately 195 MW at\nthe Lake Mariner Facility. With the ongoing reinstallation of XP miners from Nautilus, the\nCompany expects to increase its total self-mining hash rate to approximately 8.7 EH/s in the\nnear term.\nOn the WULF Compute front, TeraWulf is actively expanding its HPC hosting infrastructure\nat Lake Mariner. Notable milestones include the successful completion of a 2.5 MW HPC\nproof-of-concept project, specifically designed to support both current and next-generation\nGPU technologies. The construction of CB-1, a 20 MW Tier 3-grade HPC hosting facility, is\nprogressing on schedule and is expected to be completed by Q1 2025. Preparations for CB-\n2, a 50 MW HPC hosting facility, are also well advanced, with key components already\nsecured, positioning the Company for a timely launch by the end of Q2 2025.\nThird Quarter 2024 GAAP Financial Results\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 increased 42.8% to $27.1 million as compared to $19.0\nmillion in the third quarter of 2023. This increase is attributable to a significant growth in\noperating self-mining hash rate as well as a higher average bitcoin price relative to the third\nquarter of 2023. Notably, revenue and expenses reported in the TeraWulf GAAP income\nstatement excludes revenue and expenses from the Nautilus joint venture; the net financial\nimpact of the Nautilus joint venture is captured within equity in net income (loss) of investee,\nnet of tax in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) in the third quarter of 2024 increased 77.3% to\n$14.7 million compared to $8.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Cost of revenue\n(exclusive of depreciation) as a percentage of revenue increased to 54.2% in the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to 43.6% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to an\napproximate doubling in network difficulty and the bitcoin reward halving in April 2024,\npartially offset by an 62.0% increase in average operating hash rate and 117.3% increase in\naverage value per bitcoin self-mined year-over-year.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repaid $75.8 million of debt to fully pay down\nthe remaining balance on its Term Loans ahead of maturity.\nAbout TeraWulf\nTeraWulf develops, owns, and operates environmentally sustainable, next-generation data\ncenter infrastructure in the United States, specifically designed for Bitcoin mining and high-\nperformance computing. Led by a team of seasoned energy entrepreneurs, the Company\nowns and operates the Lake Mariner facility situated on the expansive site of a now retired\ncoal plant in Western New York.

This measure is not a\nfinancial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and it should not be considered\nas a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure calculated in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures\nreported by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i)\nimpacts of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (ii) preferred stock dividends, stock-\nbased compensation expense and related party expense to be settled with respect to\ncommon stock, all of which are non-cash items that the Company believes are not reflective\nof its general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management\njudgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other\ncompanies; (iii) equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus; (iv)\nother income which is related to interest income or income for which management believes\nis not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating activities; (v) loss on extinguishment of\ndebt, which is not reflective of the Company’s general business performance; and (vi) loss\nfrom discontinued operations, net of tax, which is not be applicable to the Company’s future\nbusiness activities. The Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA also includes the impact of\ndistributions from investee received in bitcoin related to a return on the Nautilus investment,\nwhich management believes, in conjunction with excluding the impact of equity in net\nincome (loss) of investee, net of tax, is reflective of assets available for the Company’s use\nin its ongoing operations as a result of its investment in Nautilus.\nManagement believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure allows for meaningful\ncomparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other\ncompanies, and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational\ndecision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different\nperiods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA,\nmanagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in\ncomparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nManagement believes the foregoing to be the case even though some of the excluded items\ninvolve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management does\nnot believe any of such items are normal operating expenses necessary to generate the\nCompany’s bitcoin related revenues). For example, the Company expects that share-based\ncompensation expense, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a\nsignificant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the\ncompensation provided to certain employees, officers, directors and consultants.\nAdditionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses\nnecessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenue.\nThe Company's Adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar\nmeasures provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in\nthe Company’s industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The\nCompany's Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S.\nGAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating loss or any other\nmeasure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Although management\nutilizes internally and presents Adjusted EBITDA, the Company only utilizes that measure\nsupplementally and does not consider it to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information\nprovided by U.S. GAAP financial results. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be\nconsidered in isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained\nin the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared\nin accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to its\nmost directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure (i.e., net loss attributable to common\nstockholders) for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss attributable to common\nstockholders $ (23,033) $ (19,371) $ (44,100) $ (63,692)\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss\nattributable to common stockholders\nto non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:\nPreferred stock dividends 300 272 878 796\nLoss from discontinued operations,\nnet of tax — 68 — 106\nEquity in net (income) loss of\ninvestee, net of tax 2,679 (850) (3,363) 12,613\nDistributions from investee, related\nto Nautilus 3,395 6,739 22,482 11,682\n— — — —\nIncome tax benefit\nOther income (339) (59) (1,286) (113)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 4,273 — 6,300 —\nInterest expense 409 10,251 16,779 25,535\nDepreciation 15,643 8,224 44,864 20,085\nAmortization of right-of-use asset 252 249 755 750\nStock-based compensation\nexpense 2,408 1,413 14,181 4,023\nRelated party expense to be\nsettled with respect to common\nstock — 2,085 — 2,502\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $ 5,987 $ 9,021 $ 57,490 $ 14,287\nSource: TeraWulf Inc."

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future\nfinancial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management, and expected market growth are forward-looking statements. These forward-\nlooking statements are contained principally in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis.” Without limiting the generality of the\npreceding sentence, any time we use the words “expects,” “intends,” “will,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “confident,” “continue,” “propose,” “seeks,” “could,” “may,” “should,”\n“estimates,” “forecasts,” “might,” “goals,” “objectives,” “targets,” “planned,” “projects,” and, in each case, their negative or other various or comparable terminology and\nsimilar expressions, we intend to clearly express that the information deals with possible future events and is forward-looking in nature. However, the absence of these words or\nsimilar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. For TeraWulf, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different\nthan those expressed in our forward-looking statements include, without limitation:\n• conditions in the cryptocurrency mining industry, including any prolonged substantial reduction in cryptocurrency prices, and specifically, the value of bitcoin,\nwhich could cause a decline in the demand for TeraWulf’s services;\n• the number and value of bitcoin rewards and transaction fees we earn from our bitcoin mining operations;\n• future self-mining hash rate capacity;\n• timing of receipt and deployment of miners;\n• competition among the various providers of data mining services;\n• the need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, which may be costly or difficult to obtain or may not be obtained (in whole or in\npart) and, if obtained, could significantly dilute the ownership interests of TeraWulf’s shareholders;\n• the ability to implement certain business objectives and the ability to timely and cost-effectively execute integrated projects;\n• adverse geopolitical or economic conditions, including a high inflationary environment;\n• security threats or unauthorized or impermissible access to our data centers, our operations or our digital wallet;\n• counterparty risk with respect to our digital asset custodian and our mining pool provider;\n• employment workforce factors, including the loss of key employees;\n• changes in governmental safety, health, environmental and other regulations, which could require significant expenditures;\n• liability related to the use of TeraWulf’s services;\n• currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n• other risks, uncertainties and factors included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and those\nincluded under the heading “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 19,\n2024, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report on Form 10-K”).\n3\nTable of Contents\nThese forward-looking statements reflect our views with respect to future events as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are based on assumptions and subject to\nrisks and uncertainties.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\nNOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION\nOrganization\nTeraWulf Inc. (“TeraWulf” or the “Company”) is a digital asset technology company with a core business of digital infrastructure and energy development to enable sustainable\ndata center operations. TeraWulf’s principal business consists of developing and operating purpose-built digital infrastructure currently supporting bitcoin mining loads in the\nUnited States that are fueled by predominantly clean, low cost and reliable power sources. The Company generates revenue in the form of bitcoin by providing hash\ncomputation services to a mining pool operator to mine bitcoin and validate transactions on the global bitcoin network using application-specific integrated circuit computers\n(“ASIC” or “miners”) owned by the Company. The earned bitcoin are routinely sold for U.S. dollars. In 2024, the Company established WULF Compute as its internal\ninnovation center, with a specific focus on the research, development, and deployment of its expansive and scalable digital infrastructure intended to support a broader high-\nperformance computing (“HPC”) initiative, strategically aimed at diversifying the Company’s revenue streams. Given the increasing demand from high density compute loads,\nthe Company's assets are well positioned to supply energy infrastructure targeting low cost, predominantly zero-carbon power. While the Company may choose to mine other\ndigital currencies, it has no plans to do so currently.\nAs of September 30, 2024, TeraWulf owned and operated, either independently or through a joint venture, two bitcoin mining facilities: the Lake Mariner Facility located in\nupstate New York (the “Lake Mariner Facility”) and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility located in central Pennsylvania (the “Nautilus Cryptomine Facility”). The Company’s\nwholly-owned Lake Mariner Facility began mining bitcoin in March 2022 and, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has energized four buildings and infrastructure\ncomprising approximately 195 MW of capacity. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, which has been developed and constructed through a joint venture (see Note 11),\ncommenced mining operations in February 2023 and, in April 2023, achieved full energization of the Company’s allotted infrastructure capacity of 50 MW. On October 2, 2024,\nthe Company sold its entire 25% equity interest in the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.\nOn December 13, 2021, TeraWulf Inc. completed a strategic business combination (the “Merger”) with IKONICS Corporation (“IKONICS”), a Minnesota corporation, pursuant\nto which, among other things, the Company effectively acquired IKONICS and became a publicly traded company on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated\nQuotations (“Nasdaq”), which was the primary purpose of the business combination. IKONICS’ traditional business was the development and manufacturing of high-quality\nphotochemical imaging systems for sale primarily to a wide range of printers and decorators of surfaces. As of the date of the Merger, TeraWulf classified the IKONICS\nbusiness as held for sale and discontinued operations in its condensed consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed\nsales of substantially all of IKONICS’ historical net assets (see Note 3). Subsequent to the asset sales, IKONICS’ name was changed to RM 101 Inc. (“RM 101”).\nNOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information. In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of such interim results. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe results for the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31,\n2024 or for any future interim period. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP\nfor complete presentation of annual financial statements. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with\nthe consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n13\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\nUse of Estimates in the Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nEstimates are used for (but are not limited to) such items as the fair values of contingent consideration issued in a business combination, the establishment of useful lives for\nproperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets, the fair value of equity securities or warrants to purchase common stock issued individually or as a component of a debt or\nequity offering, the fair value of changes to the conversion terms of embedded conversion features, the fair value and requisite service periods of stock-based compensation, the\nfair value of assets received in nonmonetary transactions, the establishment of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that arise from leasing arrangements, the timing of\ncommencement of capitalization for plant and equipment, impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, recoverability of deferred tax assets,\namortization of deferred issuance costs and debt discount, and the recording of various accruals. These estimates are made after considering past and current events and\nassumptions about future events. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nExcept for the updates noted below, see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a detailed discussion of the Company’s\nsignificant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nMining Pool\nThe Company has entered into an arrangement with a cryptocurrency mining pool (the Foundry USA Pool) to perform hash computation (i.e. hashrate) for the mining pool in\nexchange for consideration. Providing hash computation services to a mining pool is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of such hash computation\nservices is the sole performance obligation. The mining pool arrangement is terminable at any time without substantial penalty by Foundry USA Pool and may be terminated\nwithout substantial penalty by the Company upon providing one Contract Day’s, as defined, prior written notice. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation only begins\nwhen and continues while the Company provides hash computation services to its customer, the mining pool operator. Accordingly, the contract term with Foundry USA Pool is\ndeemed to be less than 24 hours and to continuously renew throughout the day. Additionally, the Company concluded that the mining pool operator’s (i.e., the customer’s)\nrenewal right is not a material right because the renewal rights do not include any discounts; that is, the terms, conditions, and compensation amounts are at the then-current\nmarket rates.\nThere is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nThe mining pool applies the Full Pay Per Share (“FPPS”) payout model. Under the FPPS model, in exchange for providing hash computation services to the pool, the Company\nis entitled to pay-per-share base amount and transaction fee reward compensation, calculated on a daily basis, at an amount that approximates the total bitcoin that could have\nbeen mined and transaction fees that could have been awarded using the Company’s hash computation services, based upon the then current blockchain difficulty. Under this\nmodel, the Company is entitled to compensation, payable in bitcoin, regardless of whether the pool operator successfully records a block to the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration and is all variable. Because digital currency is considered noncash consideration, fair value\nof the digital currency award received would generally be determined using the quoted price of the related digital currency in the Company’s principal market at the time of\ncontract inception. The Company has adopted an accounting policy to aggregate individual contracts with individual terms less than 24-hours within each intraday period and\napply a consistent valuation point, the start of day Coordinated Universal Time (00:00:00 UTC), to value the related noncash consideration. Revenue is recognized when it is\nprobable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, which is the same day that control of the contracted service transfers to the\nmining pool, which is the same day as the contract inception. After every 24-hour contract term, the mining pool transfers the digital currency consideration to our designated\ndigital currency wallet.\n14\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\nConsideration payable to the customer in the form of a pool operator fee, which is incurred only to the extent that the Company has generated FPPS consideration, is deducted\nfrom the bitcoin the Company receives and is recorded as contra-revenue, as it does not represent a payment for a distinct good or service. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, revenue from mining was $27.1 million and $104.3 million, respectively, as compared to $17.2 million and $40.1 million during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, respectively\nData Center Hosting\nThe Company had one data center hosting contract which was a service contract with a single performance obligation and for which the quoted price of bitcoin in the\nCompany’s principal market at the time of contract inception was approximately $38,000. The service the Company provided primarily included hosting the customer’s miners\nin a physically secure data center with electrical power, internet connectivity, ambient air cooling and available maintenance resources. The Company’s data center hosting\ncontract expired in February 2024. The Company recorded miner hosting revenue of $0 and $0.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, and $1.8 million and $5.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nPower Curtailment Credits\nProceeds related to participation in demand response programs are recorded as a reduction in cost of revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in the\nperiod corresponding to the underlying associated demand response program period. The Company recorded demand response program amounts of approximately $4.1 million\nand $7.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $1.7 million and $2.5 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nHighly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company\nhad cash and cash equivalents of $23.9 million and $54.4 million, respectively.\nThe Company currently maintains cash and cash equivalent balances primarily at two financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(“FDIC”). The Company’s accounts at these institutions are insured, up to $250,000, by the FDIC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s bank balance that exceeded the\nFDIC insurance limit was $10.7 million. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the\nfinancial institutions in which it holds deposits.\n15\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

From time to time, the Company also receives\nbitcoin as distributions-in-kind from its joint venture. Digital currency is included in current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to the Company’s ability to\nsell it in a highly liquid marketplace and because the Company reasonably expects to liquidate its digital currency to support operations within the next twelve months.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-08, Intangible – Goodwill and Other – Crypto\nAssets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (“ASU 2023-08”). ASU 2023-08 requires entities with certain crypto assets to subsequently measure\nsuch assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting period. Crypto assets that meet all the following criteria are within the scope of the\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-60:\n• meet the definition of intangible assets as defined in the Codification\n• do not provide the asset holder with enforceable rights to or claims on underlying goods, services, or other assets\n• are created or reside on a distributed ledger based on blockchain or similar technology\n• are secured through cryptography\n• are fungible, and\n• are not created or issued by the reporting entity or its related parties. In addition, entities are required to provide additional disclosures about the holdings of certain\ncrypto assets.\n16\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\nASU 2023-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and the Company\nhas elected to early adopt ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a cumulative-effect change of $37,000 to increase the balance of digital currency with a\ncorresponding decrease in the opening balance of accumulated deficit in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2024.\nAs a result of adopting ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2024, the Company measures digital currency at fair value as of each reporting period in accordance with ASC 820F, air\nValue Measurement (“ASC 820”), based on quoted prices on the active trading platform that the Company normally transacts and has determined is its principal market for\nbitcoin (Level 1 inputs), based on all information that is reasonably available. Since bitcoin is traded on a 24-hour period, the Company utilizes the price as of midnight UTC\ntime, which aligns with the Company's revenue recognition policy. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of digital currency are included within gain on fair value of digital\ncurrency, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company sells bitcoin and gains and losses from such transactions, measured as the difference\nbetween the cash proceeds and the cost basis of bitcoin as determined on a first-in-first-out basis, are also included within gain on fair value of digital currency, net in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded gain on fair value of digital currency, net of $1.0 million and $1.6 million during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08, the Company accounted for digital currency as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful\nlife is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.\nImpairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine\nwhether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not\nnecessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. The Company elected to bypass the optional qualitative impairment\nassessment and to track its bitcoin activity daily for impairment assessment purposes. The Company determined the fair value of its bitcoin on a nonrecurring basis in\naccordance with ASC 820 based on quoted prices on the active trading platform that the Company normally transacts and has determined is its principal market for bitcoin\n(Level 1 inputs), based on all information that was reasonably available. The Company performed an analysis each day to identify whether events or changes in circumstances,\nprincipally decreases in the quoted price of bitcoin on the active trading platform, indicated that it was more likely than not that its bitcoin were impaired. For impairment testing\npurposes, the lowest intraday trading price of bitcoin was identified at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of bitcoin and the lowest\ndaily trading price of bitcoin represented a recognized impairment loss. To the extent an impairment loss was recognized, the loss established the new cost basis of the asset.\nSubsequent reversal of previously recorded impairment losses was prohibited. The Company recorded impairment of digital currency of $0.9 million and $2.2 million during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nDigital currency received as noncash consideration through the Company’s mining activities are included as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to cash provided by (used in)\noperating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The receipt of digital currency as distributions-in-kind from equity investees are included within\nsupplemental disclosures of noncash investing activities. Prior to the repayment of the Term Loans in July 2024 (see Note 9) proceeds from sales of digital currency were\nincluded within cash flows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as bitcoin was converted nearly immediately into cash during that\nperiod. Subsequently, proceeds from sales of digital currency are included within cash flows from investing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as\nbitcoin has not been converted nearly immediately into cash.\nConcentrations\nThe Company and its joint venture have primarily contracted with two suppliers for the provision of bitcoin miners and one mining pool operator. The Company does not\nbelieve that these counterparties represent a significant performance risk. Revenue did not exceed 10% for any one data center hosting customer for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024. Revenue from one data center hosting customer represented 9.5% and 12.7% of consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company only operated bitcoin mining facilities; however, the\nCompany has targeted an initial commitment for an allocation of a 2.5 MW power block at the Lake Mariner Facility intended to support a broader HPC initiative and is also\nconstructing a 20 MW colocation project at the Lake Mariner Facility capable of supporting 16 MW of critical IT load with liquid cooling and redundancy requirements typical\nof a Tier 3 data center. While the Company may choose to mine other digital currencies, it has no plans to do so currently. If the market value of bitcoin declines significantly,\nthe consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company may be adversely affected.\n17\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\nOther Income\nOther income consists primarily of interest income on bank deposits. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, other income also included $0 and $39,000\nrelated to a disgorgement of short-swing profits arising from trades by a non-management insider under Section 16(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.\nLoss per Share\nThe Company computes earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to common\nstockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the\nperiod had been distributed.\nBasic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the Company’s net loss attributed to common stockholders (adjusted for preferred stock dividends declared or\naccumulated) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Convertible preferred stock, which are participating securities because\nthey share in a pro rata basis any dividends declared on common stock but because they do not have the obligation to share in the loss of the Company, are excluded from the\ncalculation of basic net loss per share. Diluted loss per share reflects the effect on weighted average shares outstanding of the number of additional shares outstanding if\npotentially dilutive instruments, if any, were converted into common stock using the treasury stock method or as-converted method as appropriate. The computation of diluted\nloss per share does not include dilutive instruments in the weighted average shares outstanding, as they would be anti-dilutive. The Company’s dilutive instruments or\nparticipating securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include convertible preferred stock, common stock warrants and restricted stock units (“RSUs”)\nissued for services. If the entire liquidation preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined in Note 13) was converted at its conversion price as of September 30,\n2024, the Company would issue approximately 1.2 million shares of Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024, Common Stock warrants outstanding were 17,585,781 with a\nweighted average strike price of $1.39 and total RSUs outstanding were 4,240,313.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision\nmaker, or decision–making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision–making group (“CODM”) is composed of\nthe chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief strategy officer. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has one operating segment, as defined, which is the Digital\nCurrency Mining segment. The Company’s mining operations are located in the United States, and the Company has employees only in the United States and views its mining\noperations as one operating segment as the CODM reviews financial information on a consolidated basis in making decisions regarding resource allocations and assessing\nperformance.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company continually assesses new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the\nCompany’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequences of such change to its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and assures\nthat there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements properly reflect the change.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 is\nintended to enhance reportable segment disclosures by requiring disclosures of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker\n(\"CODM”), requiring disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and explanation of how the reported measures of segment profit and loss are used by the CODM in\nassessing segment performance and allocation of resources. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the updated guidance will have on its disclosures.\n18\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 expands\nexisting income tax disclosures for rate reconciliations by requiring disclosure of certain specific categories and additional reconciling items that meet quantitative thresholds\nand expands disclosures for income taxes paid by requiring disaggregation by certain jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024. Early adoption is permitted.

The consideration in the Merger included, among other things, contractual contingent value\nrights (“CVR”) per a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the “CVR Agreement”), pursuant to which each shareholder of RM 101 as of immediately prior to the Merger,\nreceived one non-transferable CVR for each outstanding share of common stock of RM 101 then held. The holders of the CVRs were entitled to receive9 5% of the Net\nProceeds (as defined in the CVR Agreement), if any, from the sale, transfer, disposition, spin-off, or license of all or any part of the pre-merger business of RM 101.\nIn August 2022, RM 101 sold certain property for net sales proceeds of $13.2 million with certain indemnifications that expired in February and August 2023. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, the Company made payments of the CVR liability related to proceeds from sales of net assets held for sale of $9.6 million. Additionally, the\nCompany made payments of the CVR liability of $1.4 million in November 2023 such that as of December 31, 2023, the Company had made all of the aggregate required\ndistributions of $11.0 million of proceeds to the CVR Holders and the CVR Agreement was deemed terminated.\nUpon acquisition, the RM 101 business met the assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations criteria and is reflected as discontinued operations held for sale in these\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations included\nimmaterial selling, general and administrative, and was $68,000 and $106,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company reportedn o\nloss from discontinued operations, net of tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Total cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued\noperations was $0 and $0.3 million in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNOTE 4 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table presents the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30,\n2024 (in thousands):\nCarrying Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDigital currency $ 297 $ 297 $ — $ —\n$ 297 $ 297 $ — $ —\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, other receivables, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued construction liabilities, other accrued\nliabilities and other amounts due to related parties are considered to be representative of their respective fair values principally due to their short-term maturities. There were no\nadditional material non-recurring fair value measurements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, except for (i) the calculation of fair value of Common Stock\nwarrants issued in connection with amendments to the Company’s long-term debt agreement (see Note 9), in connection with the issuance of Common Stock (see Note 14), in\nconnection with a Common Stock exchange agreement and on a standalone basis, (ii) the change in fair value of embedded derivatives in certain of the Company’s convertible\npromissory notes (see Note 14) and (iii) the calculation of fair value of nonmonetary assets distributed from the Company’s joint venture (see Note 11). The Company utilized a\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model to value its Common Stock warrants issued except as discussed for warrants issued in connection with the Term Loans (as defined in Note\n9) and to value the change in fair value of embedded derivatives in certain of the Company’s convertible promissory notes.\n19\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

As consideration for the termination of the Ground Lease and entering into the New Ground Lease, the Company issued 20 million shares of the\nCompany’s Common Stock and paid $12 million in cash to the parent company of the counterparty in October 2024.\nNOTE 8 – INCOME TAXES\nThe Company’s tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the Company’s annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete\nitems, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. The Company has an effective tax rate of 0% for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023. The Company’s effective rate differs from its statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.\n22\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company estimated a portion of its deferred tax assets will be utilized to offset the\nCompany’s deferred tax liabilities. Based upon the level of historical U.S. losses and future projections over the period in which the remaining deferred tax assets are\ndeductible, at this time, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the remaining deductible temporary differences, and as\na result the Company has recorded a valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for the amount of deferred tax assets that will not be realized.\nThe Company has no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Interest payments were due quarterly in arrears prior to the Fifth Amendment and were due\nmonthly in arrears subsequent to the Fifth Amendment. The Company had the option to prepay all or any portion of the Term Loans in increments of at least $5.0 million\nsubject to certain prepayment fees equal to an amount of 2% of the prepaid principal, applicable to 85% of the outstanding principal. Certain events, as described in the LGSA,\nrequired mandatory prepayment.\nThe Company made no repayments on the principal balance of the Term Loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023,\nthe Company repaid $6.6 million of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans which represented the excess cash flow sweep for the quarter ended September 30,\n2023. As of December 31, 2023, certain of the investors in the Term Loans were related parties due to cumulative voting control by members of the Company’s management\nand an individual who was then a member of the Company’s board of directors.

In connection with the Joint Venture, Nautilus\nsimultaneously entered into (i) a ground lease (the “Nautilus Ground Lease”), which includes an electricity supply component, with a related party of Talen, (ii) a Facility\nOperations Agreement (the “FOA”), currently with a related party of Talen and (iii) a Corporate Services Agreement (the “CSA”) with a related party of Talen. Pursuant to the\nSecond A&R Nautilus Agreement, as of September 30, 2024, the Company held a 25% equity interest in Nautilus and Talen held a 75% equity interest in Nautilus, each subject\nto adjustment based on relative capital contributions.\nThe Nautilus Cryptomine Facility initially required 200 MW of electric capacity. Prior to May 13, 2024, the Company had the option to expand the energy requirement of the\nNautilus Cryptomine Facility by up to 50 MW, funded solely by the Company. In February 2024, the Company exercised its election to expand the energy requirements of the\nNautilus Cryptomine Facility by an additional 50 MW. The expansion of energy requirements of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility had not occurred as of September 30, 2024.\nIn March 2024, a subsidiary of Talen sold substantially all its assets to an unaffiliated third party, including the land that Nautilus utilizes pursuant to the Nautilus Ground\nLease. In connection with the sale, the Nautilus Ground Lease was assigned from Talen to the purchaser of the assets.\nOn October 2, 2024, the Company sold its entire 25% equity interest in Nautilus to the Talen Member for $85.0 million in cash, subject to a customary working capital\nadjustment (the “Nautilus Sale”). In connection with the Nautilus Sale, Nautilus transferred to the Company all of Nautilus’ right, title and interest in and to all of its miners,\nincluding miners contributed by the Talen Member, as well as certain other related equipment owned by Nautilus. The Nautilus Sale included customary representations and\nwarranties and customary covenants, including, among others, that the Talen Member will pay to the Company 25% of the net proceeds received in excess of $300.0 million in\nthe aggregate in any future sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or a majority of the equity interests of Nautilus.\nThe Company capitalized a portion of the interest on funds borrowed to finance its investments in Nautilus prior to Nautilus commencing its principal operations. Capitalized\ninterest costs were $0 and $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company capitalizedn o interest costs for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nDistributions were made periodically in accordance with each Member’s respective hashrate contributions after deducting primarily each Member’s share of power and\noperational costs. The Company received bitcoin distributions from Nautilus with a fair value of $22.5 million and $11.7 million during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\n25\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

The amount represents the contractually required capital contributions of the Company which were required for\nthe initial phase of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility buildout.\nIn August 2022, due to the change in Member ownership percentage and governance rights under the A&R Nautilus Agreement, Talen determined it controlled the Joint\nVenture from an accounting perspective and thereby was required to fair value the identifiable assets and liabilities of the Joint Venture for its internal accounting purposes.\nUnder the CSA, Talen is responsible for maintaining the books and records of the Joint Venture and elected to push down the fair value adjustments to Nautilus’ books and\nrecords. The Company accounted for its interest in Nautilus as an equity method investment and the change in ownership percentage did not impact the Company’s method of\naccounting or basis. Therefore, there was a basis difference between the books and records of Nautilus and the Company’s accounting basis in the Joint Venture.\nThe condensed results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the condensed financial position as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 of Nautilus are summarized below (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, (1) September 30, (1)\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCondensed statement of operations information:\nRevenue $ 19,321 $ 29,106 $ 90,530 $ 70,929\nOperating expense 25,711 27,619 78,461 67,646\nNet income (loss) $ (6,390) $ 1,487 $ 12,069 $ 3,283\n26\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\nThe Services Agreement also provides for performance-related milestones and related incentive compensation. In connection with the listing of its Common Stock on a\nnationally recognized stock exchange in December 2021, pursuant to the Services Agreement, the Company agreed to issue awards valued at $12.5 million with respect to\nshares of its Common Stock to certain designated employees of Beowulf E&D in accordance with TeraWulf’s then effective Plan. Additionally, once the mining facilities have\nutilized 100 MW of cryptocurrency mining load in the aggregate, and for every incremental 100 MW of cryptocurrency mining load deployed thereafter, TeraWulf agreed to\nissue additional awards of shares of TeraWulf Common Stock each in the amount of $2.5 million to certain designated employees of Beowulf E&D in accordance with\nTeraWulf’s then effective Plan. The first performance milestone of 100 MW of mining load deployed by the mining facilities was met in April 2023 and the Company recorded\nperformance milestone expense related to this milestone of $0 and $0.4 million included in selling, general and administrative expense – related party in the condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In September 2023, the Company and Beowulf E&D agreed\nto settle the then outstanding $15.0 million share based liabilities due to related party by issuing 2,460,513 shares of the Company’s Common Stock with a fair value of $3.4\nmillion and the Company recorded the remaining reduction to the share based liabilities to related party of $11.6 million to additional paid-in capital during each of the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023. In July 2023, the Company considered it probable that the second performance milestone of incremental 100 MW of mining load\ndeployed by the mining facilities would be met by December 2023. Accordingly, the Company recognized $2.5 million in share based liabilities due to related party in the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 1,083,189 shares of the Company’s\nCommon Stock with a fair value of $2.5 million to settle the share based liabilities due to related party. The Company recordedn o performance milestone expense for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNOTE 17 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $200.0 million of the Company’s\noutstanding shares of Common Stock through December 31, 2025. As of November 12, 2024, the Company has repurchased 17,968,750 shares of its Common Stock for\napproximately $115.0 million.\nOn October 25, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the “2030 Convertible Notes”). The 2030 Convertible Notes\nwere sold under a purchase agreement, dated as of October 23, 2024, entered into by and between the Company and Cantor as representative of the several initial purchasers\nnamed therein (the “Initial Purchasers”), for resale to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The\naggregate principal amount of notes sold in the offering was $500.0 million, which includes $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes issued pursuant to an option to\npurchase additional notes granted to the Initial Purchasers under the purchase agreement, which the Initial Purchasers exercised in full on October 24, 2024 and which additional\npurchase was completed on October 25, 2024.\nThe notes were issued at a price equal to1 00% of their principal amount. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately $487.1 million after deducting the\nInitial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used approximately $60 million of the net proceeds\nfrom the sale of the notes to pay the cost of certain capped call transactions and intends to use the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital,\nstrategic acquisitions, expansion of data center infrastructure to support high-performance computing activities and expansion of existing assets.\n33\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with a review of the other Items\nincluded in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. All figures presented below represent results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specified. Capitalized terms used but not\notherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the consolidated financial statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the “Company,” “TeraWulf,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to TeraWulf Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.\nCertain statements contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.\nSee “Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOverview\nWe are a premier owner and operator of purpose-built digital infrastructure currently supporting bitcoin mining loads. With a strong commitment to utilizing\npredominantly zero-carbon energy, we are focused on sustainable, environmentally conscious data center operations in the United States. By leveraging clean, affordable, and\nreliable energy sources, we aim to drive long-term sustainability within the digital infrastructure sector.\nWe operate digital infrastructure through our Lake Mariner facility, located in upstate New York (the “Lake Mariner Facility”). Situated on an expansive site along the\nshores of Lake Ontario, adjacent to a now decommissioned coal-fired power plant, this facility has the capacity to scale up to 500 megawatts (“MW”), and potentially up to 750\nMW with certain transmission upgrades. Uniquely optimized for both bitcoin mining and high-performance computing (“HPC”) workloads, the Lake Mariner Facility is well-\npositioned to meet the growing demand for compute-intensive applications. We believe this dual-purpose strategy enhances operational efficiency and diversifies our revenue\nstreams.\nRevenue Structure\nWe are primarily engaged in, and all of our revenues are derived from, bitcoin mining for our own account. Our digital asset mining involves solving complex\ncryptographic algorithms that validate transactions on the bitcoin blockchain— a process known as “mining.” Competing on a global scale, we aim to complete new blocks on\nthe blockchain to secure bitcoin rewards. With a large fleet of high-performance miners, primarily sourced from Bitmain Technologies Limited, we strive to increase bitcoin\nproduction while continuously enhancing operational efficiencies to reduce costs. We generate revenue by providing hash computation services to a mining pool operator to\nmine bitcoin and validate transactions using application-specific integrated circuit computers (“ASIC” or “miners”) owned by us. Beyond block rewards, we also earn\ntransaction fees for confirming blockchain transactions. These earnings are routinely converted into U.S. dollars. Presently, we liquidate the bitcoin mined as part of our routine\ntreasury management processes to acquire U.S. dollars for operational, capital, or other corporate expenses. Our bitcoin holdings are securely stored in a cold storage wallet\nmanaged by our custodian, NYDIG Trust Company LLC, a duly chartered New York limited liability trust company (“NYDIG”).\nFor our bitcoin mining operations, we utilize a third-party mining pool operated by Foundry Digital LLC (“Foundry”). At the close of each day, the bitcoin we have\nearned is transferred by Foundry to our custodial wallet address at NYDIG. We abstain from engaging in the direct sale of our bitcoin on any exchange. Instead, we rely on\nNYDIG to handle the sale of our mined bitcoin in accordance with our execution agreement with NYDIG, as detailed further in the “Risk Factors” section herein. Our bitcoin\nsales occur on a daily and weekly basis.\nBitcoin and Blockchain\nBitcoin, introduced in 2008, fundamentally transformed the landscape of digital currency by providing a decentralized mechanism for exchanging and preserving\nvalue. It operates on a consensus-based network, utilizing a public ledger termed as the “blockchain” to meticulously record every bitcoin transaction, allowing users to send\nand receive payments without the need for banks and other intermediaries. Bitcoin is not linked to any fiat currency or country’s monetary policy, therefore serves as a store of\nvalue outside of government control.\n34\nTable of Contents\nBitcoin mining involves validating transactions through a proof-of-work consensus method, where miners solve complex mathematical problems to add transactions to\nthe blockchain. The blockchain is maintained by a robust and public open-source architecture consisting of a network of computers, known as nodes, that work together to\nverify and validate new transactions. Because the blockchain is decentralized and transparent, all users can verify the legitimacy of a transaction without having to rely on a\nthird party. This eliminates the need for intermediaries, which can be slow and expensive, and makes the network resistant to censorship and fraud. Bitcoin mining plays a key\nrole in the maintenance and growth of the Bitcoin network by providing the computational power needed to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Factors\nsuch as computing capacity, electricity costs, and location play pivotal roles in mining operations. Generally, the greater the share a single mining rig can capture of the\nblockchain’s total network hashrate, or the aggregate hashrate deployed to solving a block on the Bitcoin blockchain, the greater the rig’s chances of solving a block and\ntherefore earning the reward.\nNetwork difficulty, which is a measure of how hard it is for miners to solve a block on the Bitcoin blockchain (and, thus, earn a mining reward), is determined by the\nnetwork’s total hashrate (i.e., the total computational power devoted to solving a block), which is adjusted every 2,016 blocks (with a new block being added approximately\nevery ten minutes). Therefore, as more miners join the network and the network’s global hashrate increases, its difficulty will increase. Conversely, if miners leave the network\nand its hashrate decreases, its difficulty will decrease.\nBitcoin Reward Halving\nThe bitcoin subsidy issued by the Bitcoin network for solving a block is subject to periodic incremental halving. The network halving is a preprogrammed, fixed\nprocess of the Bitcoin network where the bitcoin subsidy for solving a block received by miners is reduced by half approximately every four years. The network halving is a\nprocess designed to implement a periodic decreasing schedule of the issuance of new bitcoin into the market, which results in a predictable and controlled inflationary rate. The\nnetwork halving will continue to occur on this schedule until the amount of bitcoin in existence reaches the cap of 21.0 million. After each halving, the decrease in the subsidy\nprovided to miners from the Bitcoin network leads to fewer rewards for miners and therefore a decrease in revenues should the price of bitcoin remain the same. Transaction\nfees, which together with the block subsidy comprise the block reward for successfully solving a block, is not directly impacted by the halving. On April 19, 2024, the bitcoin\nrewards issued for each block solved dropped from 6.25 to 3.125, effectively reducing the bitcoin earned from bitcoin mining by 50% (excluding transactions fee rewards).\nBusiness Strategy\nIn December 2023, we launched our digital infrastructure and third-party colocation initiative, which aims to provide colocation, facility operations, security, and\nessential services for workloads in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other compute-intensive fields. While capital investments have been made to develop our HPC\ndata center infrastructure, this investment is still in its early stages and is not yet generating revenue. Nonetheless, this initiative reinforces our long-term growth and\ndiversification strategy, positioning us to meet the increasing demand for high-density compute capacity powered by low-cost, predominantly zero-carbon energy.\nSince our public debut in December 2021, we have primarily focused on sustainable bitcoin mining as our principal revenue-generating activity. As of September 30,\n2024, we deployed a fleet of 74,200 miners, including miners deployed at our jointly owned Nautilus facility located in central Pennsylvania (the “Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility”), achieving a hashrate capacity of approximately 10.0 exahashes per second (“EH/s”) with a fleet-wide efficiency of 23.2 joules per terahash (“J/TH”). In October\n2024, we sold our 25% equity interest in the Nautilus Cryptomine LLC (“Nautilus”) joint venture, representing 50 MW of mining load capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility, as part of a strategic transaction to reinvest in future growth.\nWe determine the sources of electricity used in our operations and the proportion of energy attributable to zero-carbon energy sources based on energy production data\npublished by New York Independent System Operator (“NYISO”) for upstate New York, specifically covering NYISO Zones A-E, where the Lake Mariner Facility is located,\nconsistent with recommended geographic resolution for projected emissions factors for upstate New York published by the New York State Energy Research and Development\nAuthority.\nOur business strategy centers on growing revenue and profitability by enhancing the capacity and efficiency of our self-mining fleet while expanding our data center\ninfrastructure to support HPC activities. We plan to strategically develop the infrastructure necessary for growth and profitability while pursuing adjacent high-value computing\nopportunities that leverage our power and mining expertise.\n35\nTable of Contents\nFor example, we recently completed a 2.5 MW HPC proof-of-concept project designed to support both current and next-generation GPU technology. Additionally, we\nare constructing a 20 MW colocation building (“CB-1”), a facility designed with advanced liquid cooling systems and Tier 3 redundancy. Key planned features include N+1\nredundant cooling systems, variable speed fans, chilled water infrastructure, dual power supplies, and redundant fiber network paths.\nCB-1 is scheduled to be operational by the first quarter of 2025. Following this, a second colocation building (“CB-2”) with a planned gross capacity of 50 MW, is\nexpected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2025. Planned capital expenditures associated with CB-1 will be funded in part from proceeds from the sale of our\nequity stake in the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, which was completed on October 2, 2024, and we expect that proceeds from the private offering of 2.75% Convertible Senior\nNotes due 2030 (the “2030 Convertible Notes”) will substantially fund the capital expenditures associated with CB-2. Once CB-1 and CB-2 are operational, we anticipate\nadding approximately 178 MW of additional HPC data center capacity throughout 2025, bringing the total deployed capacity at the site to around 500 MW, with the capacity\napproximately divided between bitcoin mining and HPC workloads.\nThese initiatives mark significant progress in our HPC build-out, tapping into the rapidly growing hyperscale data center market. We believe that HPC hosting aligns\nwith our current business model, leading to stable, long-term, and high-margin revenue.\nWe are confident that our expertise in power infrastructure and digital asset mining can be favorably applied to the design, development, and operation of large-scale\ndata centers. These data centers are optimized for high-value applications such as cloud computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. We will actively seek\nopportunities to expand into these areas using our knowledge, expertise, and existing infrastructure wherever favorable market opportunities arise.\nOur Facilities\nAs of September 30, 2024, TeraWulf conducted its bitcoin mining operations at two established data centers: the Lake Mariner Facility in upstate New York and the\njointly owned Nautilus Cryptomine Facility located in central Pennsylvania, which had a combined operating capacity of 10.0 EH/s with approximately 74,200 miners\ndeployed, comprised of 58,400 deployed miners at the Lake Mariner Facility and 15,800 deployed at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. As of the date of this Quarterly Report,\nthe Company has a total operational bitcoin mining capacity of approximately 195 MW at the Lake Mariner Facility and is currently constructing an additional 50 MW facility,\nwhich we expect to be operational in the first quarter of 2025.\nThe Lake Mariner Facility\nLocated at a site adjacent to the now decommissioned coal-fired power plant in Barker, New York, the Lake Mariner Facility began sustainably mining bitcoin in\nMarch 2022. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Lake Mariner Facility is operating approximately 195 MW of bitcoin mining capacity and the Company is currently\nconstructing an additional 50 MW, which we expect to be operational in the first quarter of 2025. The Company has an agreement in place with the Power Authority of the State\nof New York (“NYPA”) for 90 MW of high load factor power to support its bitcoin mining operations (the “PPA”). The PPA was executed in February 2022 and has a term of\nten years from the date of commencement of NYPA’s power delivery. The Lake Mariner Facility is situated on an expansive site on the shores of Lake Ontario and has the\ncapacity to scale up to 500 MW, and potentially up to 750 MW with certain transmission upgrades.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we own approximately 58,400 miners of which approximately 55,200 are operational at the Lake Mariner Facility with the remainder\nundergoing maintenance, awaiting disposal or on standby to replace miners under repair. These miners were comprised as follows:\n36\nTable of Contents\nVendor and Model Number of miners\nBitmain S19 Pro 6,700\nBitmain S19 XP 6,300\nBitmain S19j Pro 11,800\nBitmain S19j XP 19,400\nBitmain S19k Pro 4,100\nBitmain S21 5,100\nBitmain S21 Pro 5,000\n58,400\nAs of September 30, 2024, our fleet of miners ranged in age from 0.2 to 2.5 years with an average age of approximately 1.0 years. We do not have scheduled\ndowntime for our miners; however, while we periodically perform unscheduled maintenance on our miners, such downtime has not been significant historically. When\nperforming unscheduled maintenance, depending on the length of estimated repair time, we may replace a miner with a substitute miner to limit overall downtime. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our fleet of miners at the Lake Mariner Facility had a range of energy efficiency from 15 to 31 joules per terahash (“\"j/th”) and has an average energy\nefficiency of 22.3 j/th.\nThe Nautilus Cryptomine Facility\nLocated in Berwick, Pennsylvania, Nautilus was a joint venture between TeraWulf and a subsidiary of Talen Energy Corporation (“Talen”) (each a “Member” and\ncollectively the “Members”). Nautilus owned and operated a 200 MW bitcoin mining facility located adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt nuclear-powered Susquehanna Station. The\nNautilus Cryptomine Facility represented the first bitcoin mining facility site that was powered by 100% “behind the meter” zero-carbon nuclear energy, which was contracted\nat a fixed rate of 2.0 cents per kilowatt hour (“kWh”) for a term of five years with two successive three-year renewal options. Under the Nautilus joint venture agreement and\nprior to the sale of TeraWulf’s interests in Nautilus in October 2024, the Company held a 25% equity interest in Nautilus and Talen held a 75% equity interest, each subject to\nadjustment based on relative capital contributions. TeraWulf began mining bitcoin at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility in the first quarter of 2023 and, as of September 30, 2024,\nhad an allotted 50 MW of operational bitcoin mining capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately 48,000 miners were deployed at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility of which 46,000 were operational. Approximately 15,800\nof the deployed miners were attributed to TeraWulf’s contributions to Nautilus in order to utilize TeraWulf's allotted 50 MW of bitcoin mining capacity. These miners were\ncomprised as follows:\nVendor and Model Number of miners\nBitmain S19 Pro 6,300\nBitmain S19 XP 7,100\nBitmain S19j Pro 2,400\n15,800\nAs of September 30, 2024, these miners ranged in age from 1.5 to 1.6 years with an average age of approximately 1.5 years. Nautilus did not have scheduled\ndowntime for our miners; however, while Nautilus periodically performed unscheduled maintenance on miners, such downtime had not been significant historically. When\nperforming unscheduled maintenance, depending on the length of estimated repair time, Nautilus may have replaced a miner with a substitute miner to limit overall downtime.\nAs of September 30, 2024, these miners had a range of energy efficiency from 22 to 30 j/th and an average energy efficiency of 25.5 j/th. While the Company held a 25%\nequity interest in Nautilus, the distributions of mined bitcoin were determined by each of TeraWulf’s and Talen’s respective hashrate contributions. Accordingly, the Company\nhad contributed approximately 1.9 EH/s of a total 5.2 EH/s of miners which resulted in an approximate 35.7% of the hashrate share attributed to the Company. In connection\nwith the sale of TeraWulf’s interest in Nautilus in October 2024, Nautilus distributed to TeraWulf all of Nautilus’ right, title and interest in and to all of its miners, as well as\ncertain other related equipment owned by Nautilus.\nCombined Facilities\n37\nTable of Contents\nAs described above, there are a variety of factors that influence our ability to mine bitcoin profitably, including bitcoin’s value in USD, mining difficulty global\nhashrate, power prices, fleet energy efficiency, data center energy efficiency and other factors. The energy efficiency of a mining fleet helps drive profitability, because the\nmost significant direct expense for bitcoin mining is power. We believe we operate a highly efficient fleet of miners. The Company uses the following metrics as indicators of\noperational progress and effectiveness and believes they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to provide comparisons to peer companies.\nThe table below presents our miner efficiency and computing power as compared to the global computing power as of September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nCombined facilities1 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nGlobal hashrate (EH/s)2 602.1 391.8\nMiner efficiency (j/th)3 23.2 27.6\nTeraWulf combined average operating hashrate (EH/s)4 8.1 5.0\nTeraWulf % of global hashrate 1.3 % 1.3 %\n1 Results reflect hashrate of mining operations at the Lake Mariner Facility and TeraWulf’s net share of hashrate produced at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.\n2 Total global hashrate obtained from YCHARTS (https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate)\n3 Joules of energy required to produce each terahash of processing power\n4 While nameplate inventory for TeraWulf’s two facilities is 10.0 EH/s, inclusive of gross total hosted miners, actual monthly hashrate performance depends on a variety of factors, including (but not limited\nto) performance tuning to increase efficiency and maximize margin, scheduled outages (scopes to improve reliability or performance), unscheduled outages, curtailment due to participation in various cash\ngenerating demand response programs, derate of ASICS due to adverse weather and ASIC maintenance and repair.\nAs of September 30, 2024 our operating hashrate was approximately 1.3% of the total global hashrate, and we received approximately the same percentage of the\nglobal blockchain rewards, which as of that date, equaled approximately 6 to 7 bitcoin per day. Ultimately, in order to mine profitably, we work to ensure that these mining\nrewards cover our direct operating costs.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents the average cost of mining each bitcoin, including bitcoin mined at the Lake Mariner Facility and the Company’s net share of bitcoin mined\nat the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the total energy cost per kWh utilized within the facilities:\nCost of mining - Analysis of costs to mine one bitcoin Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of mining - Lake Mariner Facility and net share of the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility\nCost of energy per bitcoin mined $ 30,448 $ 9,322 $ 21,360 $ 8,020\nOther direct costs of mining - non energy utilities per bitcoin mined $ 51 $ 30 $ 36 $ 30\nCost to mine one bitcoin(1) $ 30,499 $ 9,352 $ 21,396 $ 8,051\nValue of each bitcoin mined(2) $ 61,075 $ 28,104 $ 59,257 $ 26,972\nCost to mine one bitcoin as % of value of bitcoin mined 49.9 % 33.3 % 36.1 % 29.8 %\nStatistics\nLake Mariner Facility and net share of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility\nTotal bitcoin mined(3) 555 981 2,305 2,384\nTotal value of bitcoin mined(2) ($ in thousands) $ 33,898 $ 27,563 $ 136,562 $ 64,308\nTotal kWhs utilized 444,817,741 293,573,428 1,267,748,635 614,524,560\nTotal energy expense, net of expected demand response proceeds(4) ($ in\nthousands) $ 16,899 $ 9,142 $ 49,226 $ 19,123\nCost per kWh $ 0.038 $ 0.031 $ 0.039 $ 0.031\nEnergy expense, net as % of value of bitcoin mined 49.9 % 33.2 % 36.0 % 29.7 %\nOther direct costs of mining ($ in thousands) $ 28 $ 29 $ 84 $ 72\n(1) “Cost to mine one bitcoin” is a cash cost metric and does not include depreciation. Although the Company recognizes depreciation with respect to its mining assets, it does not consider depreciation in\ndetermining whether it is economical to operate its mining equipment. As a result, the Company does not consider the sunk costs or depreciation of past capital investments in its historical or forecasted\nbreakeven analysis. If depreciation of our miner fleet were factored into the above cost of mining analysis, it would add $28,827 and $20,477 per bitcoin mined for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, bringing the total “cost to mine one bitcoin” to $59,326 and $41,873 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. If depreciation of our miner fleet\nwere factored into the above cost of mining analysis, it would add $10,002 and $10,025 per bitcoin mined for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, bringing the total “cost to\nmine one bitcoin” to $19,354 and $18,076 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n(2) Computed as the weighted-average opening price of bitcoin on each respective day the mined bitcoin is earned. Excludes bitcoin earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired\nin February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility.\n(3) Excludes bitcoin earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility of 0 and 14 bitcoin for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6 and 51 bitcoin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and includes TeraWulf’s net share of bitcoin mined at the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility, based on the hashrate share attributed to the Company.\n(4) Excludes energy expenses associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility and includes TeraWulf’s net share of energy expense at the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility, based on aggregate nameplate power consumption of deployed miners attributed to TeraWulf’s contribution to Nautilus.\nPower prices are the most significant cost driver for our bitcoin mining operations, and energy costs represented 49.9% and 36.0% as expressed as a percentage of\nvalue of total bitcoin mined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 33.2% and 29.7% during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. Power prices expressed as a percentage of value of total bitcoin mined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased\nas compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to an approximate doubling in network difficulty and the bitcoin reward halving in April 2024, partially offset by\nincreases in average operating hashrate and increases in average value of each bitcoin mined.\n39\nTable of Contents\nEnergy prices can be highly volatile and global events can cause power prices to increase or decrease nationwide. Our wholly-owned Lake Mariner Facility in New\nYork is subject to variable prices and market rate fluctuations with respect to wholesale power costs. Such prices are governed by market power prices and said prices can\nchange hour to hour. While this renders energy prices less predictable, it also gives us greater ability and flexibility to actively manage the energy we consume with an eye\ntowards increasing profitability and energy efficiency. Energy prices are also highly sensitive to weather events, such as winter storms and polar vortices, which increase the\ndemand for power regionally. When such events occur, we may curtail our operations to avoid using power at increased rates or we may be curtailed under demand response\nprograms in which we participate. The average power prices incurred at the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility was $0.038 and $0.039 per kWh during\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $0.031 per kWh during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe management team makes real-time determinations on the need and timing during which we should curtail. If not otherwise curtailed under demand response\nprograms, we curtail when power prices exceed the value we would receive for the corresponding fixed bitcoin reward. This means if bitcoin’s value decrease or energy prices\nincrease, our curtailment will increase; likewise, when bitcoin’s value increases and energy prices decrease, our curtailment will decrease. The management team manages this\ndecision on an hour-by-hour basis.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company curtailed operations at the Lake Mariner Facility due to weather events, energy\nprice spikes, and demand response program participation. The Company records expected payments to be received for demand response programs as a reduction in cost of\nrevenue, which amounted to $4.1 million and $7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $1.7 million and $2.5 million for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company has purchased all miners with cash and has not used limited recourse equipment financing to complete its miner purchases. The Company has raised\ncapital through both the issuance of equity and corporate level debt. These funds have been utilized to support operations, invest in our joint venture, and purchase miners and\nother fixed assets. Costs related to such issuances are not included in this analysis. Additionally, miner acquisition costs, or capital expenditures, are not factored into the above\ncost of mining analysis as capital expenditures do not impact the marginal cost of production of one bitcoin. Miner acquisition costs, or capital expenditures, are generally\nrecorded at cost in property, plant and equipment in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-\nline method over the estimated useful lives of the equipment: generally 4 years for miners and 5 years for computer equipment. Additionally, during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation expense of $0 and $5.1 million, respectively, related to certain miners of which the Company\nshortened their estimated useful lives based on replacement by April 2024. While we currently depreciate our miners over a 4-year period, given our historical low cost of\npower, it is possible the average actual useful life of our miners may exceed the depreciation period in certain circumstances. Nevertheless, if depreciation of our miner fleet\nwere factored into the above cost of mining analysis, it would add $28,827 and $20,477 per bitcoin mined in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nand $10,002 and $10,025 per bitcoin mined in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgement, including consideration of historical operating data, which is limited in the industrial-scale bitcoin\nmining space given the advent of next-generation mining rigs primarily used by the Company’s bitcoin mining operations. Depreciation periods can be adjusted periodically if\nan event, regulatory action, or change in retirement patterns indicates an update is necessary. Additionally, management considers expected future energy market prices and\nconditions, operating costs, maintenance practices and capital investment requirements in determining the estimated useful lives of our equipment and reassesses the\nreasonableness of estimated useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant. When a determination has been made that an asset will be retired or extended\nbefore or after the end of its current estimated useful life, depreciation provisions will be accelerated or extended to reflect the shortened or lengthened estimated useful life,\nwhich could have a material unfavorable or favorable impact on future results of operations.\nRecent Developments\nOn October 2, 2024, the Company sold its entire 25% equity interest to Talen Member for $85.0 million in cash, subject to a customary working capital adjustment\n(the “Nautilus Sale”). In connection with the Nautilus Sale, Nautilus transferred to the Company all of Nautilus’ right, title and interest in and to all of its miners, including\nminers contributed by the Talen Member, as well as certain other related equipment owned by Nautilus. The Nautilus Sale included customary representations and warranties\nand customary covenants, including, among others, that the Talen Member will pay the Company 25% of the net proceeds received in excess of $300.0 million in the aggregate\nin any future sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or a majority of the equity interests of Nautilus.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOn October 9, 2024, the Company terminated the Ground Lease and entered into a new lease with the same related party counterparty (the “New Ground Lease”)\nrelated to the Lake Mariner Facility which expanded the acreage of real property as compared to the Ground Lease for the purposes of cryptocurrency mining and HPC data\ncenter operations. The New Ground Lease includes fixed payments, including an annual escalation factor as well as the Company’s proportionate share of the landlord’s cost to\nown, operate and maintain the premises and has an initial term of 35 years, commencing on October 9, 2024, and will automatically renew for up to nine additional periods of\nfive years each unless the Company provides written notice to terminate the lease at least six months prior to the expiration of the initial term or the then-current renewal term.\nUpon expiration of the New Ground Lease, the buildings and improvements on the premises will revert to the landlord in good order. As consideration for the termination of the\nGround Lease and entering into the New Ground Lease, the Company issued 20 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock and paid $12.0 million in cash in October\n2024.\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $200.0 million of the\nCompany’s outstanding shares of Common Stock through December 31, 2025. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company has repurchased 17,968,750 shares of its\nCommon Stock for approximately $115.0 million.\nOn October 25, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the “2030 Convertible Notes”). The 2030 Convertible\nNotes were sold under a purchase agreement, dated as of October 23, 2024, entered into by and between the Company and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as representative of the\nseveral initial purchasers named therein (the “Initial Purchasers”), for resale to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended. The aggregate principal amount of notes sold in the offering was $500.0 million, which includes $75.0 million aggregate principal amount\nof notes issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional notes granted to the Initial Purchasers under the purchase agreement, which the Initial Purchasers exercised in full on\nOctober 24, 2024 and which additional purchase was completed on October 25, 2024.\nThe notes were issued at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately $487.1 million after\ndeducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used approximately $60.0 million of the\nnet proceeds from the sale of the notes to pay the cost of certain capped call transactions and plans to use the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include\nworking capital, strategic acquisitions, expansion of data center infrastructure to support high-performance computing activities and expansion of existing assets.\nThe Business Combination\nTeraWulf completed its business combination with IKONICS Corporation (“IKONICS”) on December 13, 2021 pursuant to which, among other things, the Company\neffectively acquired IKONICS and became a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq, which was the primary purpose of the business combination. The consideration in the\nMerger included, among other things, contractual contingent value rights (“CVR”) per a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the “CVR Agreement”) pursuant to which each\nshareholder of IKONICS as of immediately prior to the Merger, received one non-transferable CVR for each outstanding share of common stock of IKONICS then held. The\nholders of the CVRs were entitled to receive 95% of the Net Proceeds (as defined in the CVR Agreement), if any, from the sale, transfer, disposition, spin-off, or license of all or\nany part of the pre-merger business of IKONICS. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made payments of the CVR liability related to proceeds\nfrom sales of net assets held for sale of $9.6 million. Additionally, the Company made payments of the CVR liability of $1.4 million in November 2023 such that as of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had made all of the aggregate required distributions of $11.0 million of proceeds to the CVR Holders and the CVR Agreement was deemed\nterminated.\nResults of Operations\nThe Company generates revenue in the form of bitcoin by providing hash computation services to a mining pool operator to mine bitcoin and validate transactions on\nthe global Bitcoin network using application-specific integrated circuit computers owned by the Company. The earned bitcoin are routinely sold for U.S. dollars. The Company\nalso earned revenue by providing miner hosting services to third parties. While the Company may choose to mine other digital currencies, it has no plans to do so currently.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s business strategy centers on growing revenue and profitability by enhancing the capacity and efficiency of our self-mining fleet while expanding our\ndata center infrastructure to support HPC activities. We plan to strategically develop the infrastructure necessary for growth and profitability while pursuing adjacent high-value\ncomputing opportunities that leverage our power and mining expertise. We are confident that our expertise in power infrastructure and digital asset mining can be favorably\napplied to the design, development, and operation of large-scale data centers. These data centers are optimized for high-value applications such as cloud computing, machine\nlearning, and artificial intelligence. We will actively seek opportunities to expand into these areas using our knowledge, expertise, and existing infrastructure wherever favorable\nmarket opportunities arise.\nRevenue\nThe following table presents revenue (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 27,059 $ 18,955 $ 105,066 $ 45,944\nRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $27.1 million and $19.0 million, respectively, an increase of $8.1 million. The increase in\nrevenue was primarily attributed to an increase in the average price of bitcoin during the three months ended September 30, 2024 of $61,023 as compared to $28,129 during the\nsame period in the prior year and an increase in mining capacity at the Lake Mariner Facility to approximately 195 MW as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 110 MW as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the total bitcoin mined due to impacts of the halving in April 2024 and the increase in network\nhashrate, resulting in total bitcoin mined of 442 bitcoin during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 624 bitcoin during the same period in the prior year.\nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $105.1 million and $45.9 million, respectively, an increase of $59.2 million. The increase was\nprimarily attributed to an increase in the average price of bitcoin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $60,022 as compared to $26,313 during the same period\nin the prior year and an increase in mining capacity at the Lake Mariner Facility to approximately 195 MW as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 110 MW as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, partially offset by decreases in the total bitcoin mined due to impacts of the halving in April 2024 and the increase in network hashrate, resulting in total\nbitcoin mined of 1,754 bitcoin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,560 bitcoin during the same period in the prior year.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from hosting was $0 and $0.8 million, respectively, as compared to $1.8 million and $5.8\nmillion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, a decrease due to the expiration of the Company’s one data center hosting contract with a\ncustomer in February 2024.\nCosts and Expenses\nThe following table presents cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) $ 14,660 $ 8,268 $ 42,986 $ 18,383\n42\nTable of Contents\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $14.7 million and $8.3 million, respectively, an increase of\n$6.4 million. Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $43.0 million and $18.4 million, respectively, an\nincrease of approximately $24.6 million. Cost of revenues is primarily comprised of power expense and the increases were primarily due to the increase in mining and hosting\ncapacity due to infrastructure constructed and placed in service between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024 and, to a lesser extent, slight increase in realized power\nprices during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The Company records proceeds related to participation in demand\nresponse programs as a reduction in cost of revenue in the period corresponding to the underlying demand response program period; the amount of aggregate proceeds received\nor expected to be received were $4.1 million and $7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $1.7 million and $2.5 million for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company is actively expanding its enrollment in such available programs in New York State.\nThe following table presents operating expenses (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating expenses $ 729 $ 442 $ 2,311 $ 1,218\nOperating expenses – related party 856 779 2,619 2,015\n$ 1,585 $ 1,221 $ 4,930 $ 3,233\nOperating expenses (including related party expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, a net\nincrease of $0.4 million primarily due to higher property insurance. Operating expenses (including related party expenses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, were $4.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively, a net increase of $1.7 million primarily due to higher property insurance and miner repair costs as well as $0.5 million in\noperating expenses – related party increased due to increased staffing at the Lake Mariner Facility. These increases related to infrastructure constructed and placed in service\nbetween September 30, 2023 and 2024.\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative expenses (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 8,502 $ 5,767 $ 29,904 $ 18,137\nSelling, general and administrative expenses – related party 2,976 4,519 8,399 10,093\n$ 11,478 $ 10,286 $ 38,303 $ 28,230\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (including related party expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $11.5 million and $10.3\nmillion, respectively, a net increase of $1.2 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of professional fees, legal fees, employee\ncompensation and benefits, stock-based compensation to employees and consultants, insurance and general corporate expenses. The increase was primarily due to increased\nexpense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year of stock-based compensation of $1.0 million, employee\ncompensation and benefits of $0.4 million, and legal and other professional fees of $1.5 million. These increases were partially offset by decreased expenses during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year of insurance expense of $0.3 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses – related\nparty decreased $1.7 million primarily due to performance milestone expense under the Administrative and Infrastructure Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with\nBeowulf Electricity & Data Inc. (“Beowulf E&D”).\n43\nTable of Contents\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (including related party expenses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $38.3 million and $28.2\nmillion, respectively, a net increase of $10.1 million. The increase was primarily due to increased expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the\nsame period in the prior year of stock-based compensation of $10.2 million, employee compensation and benefits of $1.0 million, travel expenses of $0.6 million and legal and\nother professional fees of $0.4 million. These increases were partially offset by decreased expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same\nperiod in the prior year of insurance expense of $0.7 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses – related party decreased primarily due to performance milestone\nexpense of $2.1 million under the Services Agreement with Beowulf E&D for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nDepreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $15.6 million and $8.2 million, respectively, an increase of $7.4 million. Depreciation for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $44.9 million and $20.1 million, respectively, an increase of $24.8 million. The increases were primarily due to the\nincrease in mining capacity due to infrastructure constructed and placed in service between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Additionally, during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation expense of $0 and $5.1 million, respectively, related to certain miners of which the\nCompany shortened their estimated useful lives based on expected replacement by April 30, 2024.\nGain on fair value of digital currency, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, as a result of the\nCompany adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-08, Intangible – Goodwill and Other – Crypto Assets\n(Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (“ASU 2023-08”) on January 1, 2024 which requires entities with certain crypto assets to subsequently\nmeasure such assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting period. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08, the Company recorded\nimpairment of digital currency of $0.9 million and $2.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, representing the decline in bitcoin\nprices during the Company’s holding period of its bitcoin, which was not reversed during its holding period, and realized gain on sale of digital currency for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 of $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, upon subsequent liquidation of bitcoin held. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2023-\n08 effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a cumulative-effect change of $37,000 to increase the balance of digital currency with a corresponding decrease in the opening balance\nof accumulated deficit in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2024.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $0.4 million related to the expected sale of 1,200 miners\nfor proceeds of $0.2 million which were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and included in other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment of $0.4 million related to\ndisposals of miners.\nInterest expense was $0.4 million and $10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $9.9 million. Interest expense\nrelates primarily to the borrowings under the Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement (the “LGSA”) with Wilmington Trust (the “Term Loans”), which had an original maturity\ndate of December 1, 2024 and was fully repaid in July 2024 ahead of maturity. Interest expense was $16.8 million and $25.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, an decrease of $8.7 million. The decrease in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the\nprior year is primarily due to repayments of the Term Loans principal balance subsequent to September 30, 2023 resulting in (i) a decrease of amortization of debt issuance costs\nand debt discount of $3.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 and (ii) a decrease of $5.5 million in interest\nexpense related to the stated interest rate, which remained unchanged.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $4.3 million and $6.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to voluntary\nprepayments of the Term Loans in February and July 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred prepayment fees of $1.0\nmillion and $1.3 million, respectively, to voluntarily prepay $56.0 million and $74.5 million of the Company’s Term Loans, respectively, and the derecognition of unamortized\ndebt discount of $3.3 million and $5.0 million associated with the principal repaid, respectively. The Company made no repayments on the principal balance of the Term Loans\nduring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n44\nTable of Contents\nIncome tax benefit was $0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Based upon the level of historical U.S. losses and future projections over\nthe period in which the net deferred tax assets are deductible, at this time, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the\nremaining deductible temporary differences, and as a result the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its gross deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023.\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax\nEquity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $(2.7) million and $3.4 million, respectively as\ncompared to $0.9 million and $(12.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which represents TeraWulf’s proportional share of income\nor losses of Nautilus, which commenced principal operations in February 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount also includes an\nimpairment loss of $0 and $13.6 million, respectively, on the distribution of miners from Nautilus to the Company whereby the miners were marked to fair value from book\nvalue on the date distributed. The impairment loss was the result of decreasing prices for miners between initial purchase and distribution.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nTo provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (“U.S. GAAP”), we disclose Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and\nit should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders adjusted for (i) impacts of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (ii) preferred\nstock dividends, stock-based compensation expense and related party expense to be settled with respect to common stock, all of which are non-cash items that the Company\nbelieves are not reflective of its general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly\nin comparison to other companies; (iii) equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus; (iv) other income which is related to interest income or income for\nwhich management believes is not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating activities; (v) loss on extinguishment of debt, which is not reflective of the Company’s general\nbusiness performance and (vi) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, which is not be applicable to the Company’s future business activities. The Company’s Adjusted\nEBITDA also includes the impact of distributions from investee received in bitcoin related to a return on the Nautilus investment, which management believes, in conjunction\nwith excluding the impact of equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, is reflective of assets available for the Company’s use in its ongoing operations as a result of its\ninvestment in Nautilus.\nManagement believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and\nthose of other companies, and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating\nresults over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to\ninvestors and analysts in comparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the foregoing to be the case even though\nsome of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management does not believe any of such items are normal operating\nexpenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenues). For example, the Company expects that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from\nAdjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees,\nofficers, directors and consultants. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related\nrevenue.\nThe Company’s Adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other\ncompanies in the Company’s industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance\nunder U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating loss or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Although\nmanagement utilizes internally and presents Adjusted EBITDA, the Company only utilizes that measure supplementally and does not consider it to be a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, the information provided by U.S. GAAP financial results. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation of, and should be read in\nconjunction with, the information contained in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure (i.e., net loss attributable\nto common stockholders) for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (23,033) $ (19,371) $ (44,100) $ (63,692)\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss attributable to common stockholders to non-\nGAAP Adjusted EBITDA:\nPreferred stock dividends 300 272 878 796\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax — 68 — 106\nEquity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax 2,679 (850) (3,363) 12,613\nDistributions from investee, related to Nautilus 3,395 6,739 22,482 11,682\nIncome tax benefit — — — —\nOther income (339) (59) (1,286) (113)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 4,273 — 6,300 —\nInterest expense 409 10,251 16,779 25,535\nDepreciation 15,643 8,224 44,864 20,085\nAmortization of right-of-use asset 252 249 755 750\nStock-based compensation expense 2,408 1,413 14,181 4,023\nRelated party expense to be settled with respect to common stock — 2,085 — 2,502\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $ 5,987 $ 9,021 $ 57,490 $ 14,287\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $23.9 million, a working capital balance of $0, total stockholders’ equity of $372.6 million\nand an accumulated deficit of $303.1 million. The Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. The Company began mining bitcoin in March 2022 and had 10.0 EH/s of operating capacity across the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. To date, the Company has relied primarily on proceeds from sale of bitcoin, both self-mined and distributed from the joint venture which owns the\nNautilus Cryptomine Facility, and its issuances of debt and equity to fund its principal operations.\nThe principal uses of cash are for the operation and buildout of mining facilities, debt service and general corporate activities and, to a lesser extent in 2023,\ninvestments in Nautilus joint venture related to mining facility buildout and general corporate activities. Cash flow information is as follows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities:\nContinuing operations $ 18,302 $ (6,915)\nDiscontinued operations — 283\nTotal operating activities 18,302 (6,632)\nInvesting activities (82,396) (44,237)\nFinancing activities 33,593 49,141\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents $ (30,501) $ (1,728)\n46\nTable of Contents\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $18.3 million and $(6.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $24.9\nmillion increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by the increase in mining capacity at the Lake Mariner Facility and\nincreases in the average price of bitcoin, partially offset by increased network hashrate and the effects of the halving in April 2024.\nCash used in investing activities for continuing operations was $82.4 million and $44.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company invested $114.3 million and $41.4 million in the buildout of its mining facilities at the Lake Mariner Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company invested $2.8 million, on a net basis, in its joint venture. Furthermore, the\nCompany received $31.9 million of proceeds from sales of digital currency not converted nearly immediately into cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCash provided by financing activities for continuing operations was $33.6 million and $49.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively primarily related to proceeds from issuances of Common Stock, net of issuance costs, of $192.9 million and $60.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, which included proceeds from warrant issuances of $4.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively. In addition, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company made principal payments on long-term debt of $140.7 million and payments of $16.8 million related to tax withholdings related to net share\nsettlements of stock-based compensation awards. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received proceeds from issuance of a convertible promissory\nnote of $1.3 million, and made payments of contingent value rights liability related to proceeds from sale of net assets held for sale of $9.6 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has one Future Sales and Purchase Agreement (the “March 2024 Bitmain Purchase Agreement”) with Bitmain Technologies\nDelaware Limited (“Bitmain Delaware”) which, as supplemented, provides the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 7,020 PH (approximately 30,000\nminers) of S21 Pro miners, pursuant to certain payment timing conditions, by December 31, 2024 for a purchase price of $112.3 million (“Bitmain Call Option”). As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had paid Bitmain Delaware $11.2 million, calculated as 10% of the purchase price (the “Call Option Fee”). The Call Option Fee shall be\napplied to the settlement of future down payments of purchases under the Bitmain Call Option, in whole or in part in proportion to the ratio of quantity to be purchased to the\nmaximum PH available under the Bitmain Call Option. In May 2024, the Company exercised an option pursuant to the Bitmain Call Option to purchase 5,000 S21 Pro units and\npaid Bitmain Delaware an additional $16.8 million for these units. In October 2024, the Company exercised an option pursuant to the Bitmain Call Option to purchase 10,600\nS21 Pro units and paid Bitmain Delaware an additional $35.7 million for these units. In October 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 3,200 S21 Pro units to a\nthird party for a purchase price of $12.0 million.\nThe Company was a counterparty to the Amended and Restated Talen Joint Venture Agreement dated August 27, 2022 (“A/R Joint Venture Agreement”). Under this\nA/R Joint Venture Agreement, as of September 30, 2024 the Company had invested $102.7 million on a net basis and has right-sized its equity ownership interest to 25% of the\njoint venture. On October 2, 2024, the Company sold its entire 25% equity interest to the Talen Member for $85.0 million, subject to a customary working capital adjustment\n(the “Nautilus Sale”).\nFinancial Condition\nThe Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $44.1 million and generated cash flows from continuing operations of $18.3 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had balances of cash and cash equivalents of $23.9 million, a working capital balance of $0,\ntotal stockholders’ equity of $372.6 million and an accumulated deficit of $303.1 million. The Company had 10.0 EH/s of operating capacity across the Lake Mariner Facility\nand the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility as of September 2024. To date, the Company has relied primarily on proceeds from sales of bitcoin, both self-mined and distributed from\nthe joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, and its issuances of debt and equity to fund its principal operations. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the\nCompany completed (i) a private offering of the 2030 Convertible Notes for an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million and (ii) the sale of the Company’s 25% equity\ninterest in Nautilus for cash proceeds of $85.0 million, the proceeds of which, together with continuing cash flows from operations, are expected to fund strategic development\nof future infrastructure necessary for growth and profitability in bitcoin mining and data center hosting of HPC workloads.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe above discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its condensed consolidated financial statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be\ndetermined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and\nsuch differences may be material to the financial statements.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 2 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a summary of the Company’s\nsignificant accounting policies.\nDigital currency\nDigital currency is comprised of bitcoin earned as noncash consideration in exchange for providing hash computation services to a mining pool as well as in exchange\nfor data center hosting services. From time to time, the Company also receives bitcoin as distributions-in-kind from its joint venture. Digital currency is included in current\nassets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to the Company’s ability to sell it in a highly liquid marketplace and because the Company reasonably expects to\nliquidate its digital currency to support operations within the next twelve months.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08 which requires entities with certain crypto assets to subsequently measure such assets at fair value, with changes in\nfair value recorded in net income in each reporting period. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024. The Company measures digital\ncurrency at fair value as of each reporting period in accordance with ASC 820 based on quoted prices on the active trading platform that the Company normally transacts and\nhas determined is its principal market for bitcoin (Level 1 inputs), based on all information that is reasonably available. Since bitcoin is traded on a 24-hour period, the\nCompany utilizes the price as of midnight UTC time, which aligns with the Company's revenue recognition policy. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of digital currency\nare included within gain on fair value of digital currency, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company sells bitcoin and gains and losses from such\ntransactions, measured as the difference between the cash proceeds and the cost basis of bitcoin as determined on a first-in-first-out basis, are also included within gain on fair\nvalue of digital currency, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08, the Company accounted for digital currency as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an\nindefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the\nasset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The Company elected to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and to\ntrack its bitcoin activity daily for impairment assessment purposes. The Company determined the fair value of its bitcoin on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), based on quoted prices on the active trading platform that the Company normally transacts and has determined is its principal market for\nbitcoin (Level 1 inputs), based on all information that was reasonably available. The Company performed an analysis each day to identify whether events or changes in\ncircumstances, principally decreases in the quoted price of bitcoin on the active trading platform, indicated that it was more likely than not that its bitcoin were impaired. For\nimpairment testing purposes, the lowest intraday trading price of bitcoin was identified at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of\nbitcoin and the lowest daily trading price of bitcoin represented a recognized impairment loss. To the extent an impairment loss was recognized, the loss established the new cost\nbasis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of previously recorded impairment losses was prohibited.\n48\nTable of Contents\nLong-lived Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Judgment is necessary in estimating the Company’s various assets’ useful lives.\nThis includes evaluating the Company’s own usage experience with its currently owned assets, the quality of materials used in construction-related projects and, for its miners,\nthe rate of technological advancement and market-related factors such as the price of bitcoin and the bitcoin network hashrate, which impact the value of the miners.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally 5 years for computer equipment and 4 years for miners).\nLeasehold improvements and electrical equipment are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term. Changes in depreciation and amortization,\ngenerally accelerated depreciation, are determined and recorded when estimates of the remaining useful lives or residual values of long-term assets change.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an\nasset to undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Significant judgment is used when estimating future cash flows, particularly the price of bitcoin and the\nnetwork hashrate. Any impairment loss recorded is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Should our estimates\nof useful lives, undiscounted cash flows, or asset fair values change, additional and potentially material impairments may be required, which could have a material impact on\nour reported financial results.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company measures stock-based compensation cost related to share-based payment awards at the grant date of the award, based on the estimated fair value of the\naward. For restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with time-based vesting, the fair value is determined by the Company’s common stock price on the date of the grant. For RSUs with\nvesting based on market conditions (“PSUs”), the effect of the market condition is considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation\nmodel. Stock-based compensation expense for PSUs is recorded over the derived service period unless the market condition is satisfied in advance of the derived service period,\nin which case a cumulative catch-up is recognized as of the date of achievement. Stock-based compensation for PSUs is recorded regardless of whether the market conditions\nare met unless the service conditions are not met. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The Company uses significant judgment in determining the likelihood of\nmeeting milestones and market conditions. Inputs into valuation models such as Monte Carlo simulations include both the Company’s and guideline public company historical\nand expected annual volatility and, depending on the inputs selected, the Company could calculate significantly different estimated grant date fair values, materially impacting\nthe valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense we recognize in future periods.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to\ncalculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of\ntemporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which\nmanagement believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provision of ASC 740 related to accounting for\nuncertain income tax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is more likely than not that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities,\nwhile others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of\nASC 740, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely\nthat not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated\nwith other positions. The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has\na greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with the tax positions taken that\nexceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the Company’s balance sheets along with any associated interest\nand penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The most critical estimate for income taxes is the determination of whether to record a valuation\nallowance for any net deferred tax asset, including net loss carryforwards, whereby management must estimate whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset\nwould be realized.\n49\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of such period, are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are:\n• Recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and\n• Accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n50\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, TeraWulf may be involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of its business. Some of\nthese proceedings, lawsuits or claims may be material and involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties and could result in damages, fines,\npenalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. TeraWulf recognizes provisions for claims or pending litigation when it determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the\namount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from\nestimates. TeraWulf was not subject to any material pending legal and administrative proceedings, lawsuits or claims during the period covered by this Quarterly Report.\nTeraWulf’s business and operations are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against TeraWulf.\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. Before deciding whether to invest in our Common Stock, in addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which is incorporated herein by\nreference. If any of the risks or uncertainties described therein actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and\nadversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we have\ndescribed are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our\nbusiness operations.\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q, except for the risk factor noted below.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to short selling strategies.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities\nback at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the\npurchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller’s best interests for the\nprice of the stock to decline, may short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects to create\nnegative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\nWe are, and may in the future may be, the subject of unfavorable allegations made by short sellers. For example, in August and October of this year, short sellers\npublished reports that contained certain allegations against us that we believe to be misleading. Any such allegations may be followed by periods of instability in the market\nprice of our shares of common stock and negative publicity. We may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of\nfreedom of speech, applicable federal or state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. In addition, any related inquiry or formal investigation from a governmental\norganization or other regulatory body, including any inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or the U.S. Department of Justice, could result in a\nmaterial diversion of our management’s time and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Such a situation could be costly and time-\nconsuming and could distract our management from operating our business. We recently received an inquiry from the SEC relating to the allegations in the recent short seller\nreports relating to the sources of electricity used in our operations and the proportion of energy attributable to zero-carbon energy sources and, while we believe those\nallegations to be misleading, we cannot predict the impact that the SEC’s inquiry will have on our business and results of operations. SEC investigations are generally fact-\nfinding inquiries and do not necessarily mean that the SEC has concluded that we have violated the federal securities laws or that the SEC has a negative view of the Company.\nWe intend to cooperate fully. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could adversely impact our business, and cause downward\npressure and increased volatility in the price of our shares of common stock.\nITEM 2.

Mr. Farrell will continue to report directly to Nazar Khan, Chief Technology Officer of TeraWulf.\n\n“This promotion reflects Sean’s exceptional leadership, unwavering commitment to operational excellence, and the strong relationships he has cultivated within and outside the Company,” said Paul Prager, Chief Executive Officer of TeraWulf. “Our leadership team is a vital asset to TeraWulf, and Sean embodies the qualities that drive our success.

It is crucial that our leadership team delivers results for our shareholders. Sean’s promotion marks a significant step forward in our commitment to operational excellence and organic growth.

I look forward to driving that growth in the coming years to be a top player in the space.”\n\n**About TeraWulf**\n\nTeraWulf develops, owns, and operates environmentally sustainable, next-generation data center infrastructure in the United States, specifically designed for Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing.

Such forward-looking statements include statements concerning anticipated future events and expectations that are not historical facts.

(Nasdaq: WULF) (“TeraWulf” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of vertically integrated, next-generation digital infrastructure powered by predominantly zero-carbon energy, today announced its unaudited interim financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and provided an operational update.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Operational and Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Self-mined 442 bitcoin at the Lake Mariner Facility.\n  * Revenue increased to $27.1 million in Q3 2024 compared to $19.0 million in Q3 2023.\n  * Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) increased to $14.7 million in Q3 2024 compared to $8.3 million in Q3 2023.\n  * Total self-mining hashrate capacity of 10.0 EH/s as of September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 100.0% relative to the same prior year period.\n\n\n\n**Key GAAP Metrics ($ in thousands)** | **Three Months Ended Q3 2024** | **Three Months Ended Q3 2023** | **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \nRevenue | $ | 27,059  | $ | 18,955  | 42.8 | %  \nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) | $ | 14,660  | $ | 8,268  | 77.3 | %  \nCost of revenue as % of revenue | 54.2 | % | 43.6 | % | 24.3 | %  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Non-GAAP Operational and Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Self-mined 555 bitcoin across the Lake Mariner and Nautilus Cryptomine facilities, which represented a 43.4% decrease relative to in Q3 2023.\n  * Total value of bitcoin self-mined1 of $33.9 million in Q3 2024 compared to $27.6 million in Q3 2023.\n  * Power cost per bitcoin self-mined increased year-over-year, to $30,448 per bitcoin in Q3 2024 from $9,322 per bitcoin in Q3 2023, due to an approximate doubling in network difficulty and the bitcoin reward halving in April 2024.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $6.0 million in Q3 2024, an decrease of 33.6% from $9.0 million in Q3 2023.\n\n\n\n**Key Non-GAAP Metrics 2** | **Three Months Ended Q3 2024** | **Three Months Ended Q3 2023** | **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---  \nBitcoin Self-Mined3 |  555 |  981 | (43.4 | ) %  \nValue per Bitcoin Self-Mined4 | $ | 61,075 | $ | 28,104 | 117.3 | %  \nPower Cost per Bitcoin Self-Mined5 | $ | 30,448 | $ | 9,322 | 226.6 | %  \nAvg.

Accordingly, operating results of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility are not reflected in revenue, cost of revenue or cost of operations lines in TeraWulf’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses these metrics as indicators of operational progress and effectiveness and believes they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to provide comparisons to peer companies. All figures except Bitcoin Self-Mined are estimates.3 Excludes BTC earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility and TeraWulf’s net share of BTC produced at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.4 Computed as the weighted-average opening price of BTC on each respective day the Self-Mined Bitcoin is earned.5 The Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 calculations excludes 0 and 14 bitcoin, respectively, earned via hosting profit share.6 While nameplate inventory for TeraWulf’s two facilities was 10.0 EH/s and 5.5 EH/s as of Q3 2024 and Q3 2023, respectively, actual monthly hash rate performance depends on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) performance tuning to increase efficiency and maximize margin, scheduled outages (scopes to improve reliability or performance), unscheduled outages, curtailment due to participation in various cash generating demand response programs, derate of ASICS due to adverse weather and ASIC maintenance and repair. Average operating hash rate for Q3 2023 also includes hash rate related to a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter marked a pivotal turning point for TeraWulf, as we delivered strong results across our strategic, financial, and operational objectives,” said Paul Prager, Chairman and CEO of TeraWulf. “The sale of our interest in the Nautilus joint venture not only generated a substantial return but also sharpened our focus on scaling high-performance computing at Lake Mariner. Securing an expanded ground lease with exclusive rights to 750 MW of infrastructure capacity is a significant milestone in our growth strategy. Combined with the success of our $500.0 million capital raise, we are exceptionally well-positioned to seize new opportunities in both Bitcoin mining and HPC hosting as we enter 2025.”\n\nPrager continued, “We are excited about the surging demand for high-performance computing and the unique opportunity it presents for TeraWulf. Our power-ready energy assets offer a competitive advantage unmatched in the industry, providing a strong foundation as we scale our energy and digital infrastructure capabilities. We are focused on securing a customer contract by year-end, and remain dedicated to delivering outstanding value for our shareholders.”\n\nPatrick Fleury, TeraWulf’s CFO added, \"We are fully funded to execute our growth plans through the first half of 2025. In October, we secured $500.0 million in convertible notes financing, using $60 million for a capped call to neutralize dilution up to a share price of $12.80. Simultaneously, we repurchased $115.0 million in common stock, resulting in no effective dilution until the stock exceeds $18.00 per share. This strategic move reinforces our commitment to shareholder value and positions us for strong growth ahead.\"\n\n**Operations Update**\n\nTeraWulf's current operational Bitcoin mining capacity includes approximately 195 MW at the Lake Mariner Facility. With the ongoing reinstallation of XP miners from Nautilus, the Company expects to increase its total self-mining hash rate to approximately 8.7 EH/s in the near term.\n\nOn the WULF Compute front, TeraWulf is actively expanding its HPC hosting infrastructure at Lake Mariner. Notable milestones include the successful completion of a 2.5 MW HPC proof-of-concept project, specifically designed to support both current and next-generation GPU technologies. The construction of CB-1, a 20 MW Tier 3-grade HPC hosting facility, is progressing on schedule and is expected to be completed by Q1 2025. Preparations for CB-2, a 50 MW HPC hosting facility, are also well advanced, with key components already secured, positioning the Company for a timely launch by the end of Q2 2025.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 increased 42.8% to $27.1 million as compared to $19.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. This increase is attributable to a significant growth in operating self-mining hash rate as well as a higher average bitcoin price relative to the third quarter of 2023. Notably, revenue and expenses reported in the TeraWulf GAAP income statement excludes revenue and expenses from the Nautilus joint venture; the net financial impact of the Nautilus joint venture is captured within equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) in the third quarter of 2024 increased 77.3% to $14.7 million compared to $8.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) as a percentage of revenue increased to 54.2% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 43.6% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to an approximate doubling in network difficulty and the bitcoin reward halving in April 2024, partially offset by an 62.0% increase in average operating hash rate and 117.3% increase in average value per bitcoin self-mined year-over-year.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repaid $75.8 million of debt to fully pay down the remaining balance on its Term Loans ahead of maturity.\n\n**About TeraWulf**\n\nTeraWulf develops, owns, and operates environmentally sustainable, next-generation data center infrastructure in the United States, specifically designed for Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. Led by a team of seasoned energy entrepreneurs, the Company owns and operates the Lake Mariner facility situated on the expansive site of a now retired coal plant in Western New York. Currently, TeraWulf generates revenue primarily through Bitcoin mining, leveraging predominantly zero-carbon energy sources, including hydroelectric and nuclear power. Committed to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles that align with its business objectives, TeraWulf aims to deliver industry-leading economics in mining and data center operations at an industrial scale.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) impacts of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (ii) preferred stock dividends, stock-based compensation expense and related party expense to be settled with respect to common stock, all of which are non-cash items that the Company believes are not reflective of its general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus; (iv) other income which is related to interest income or income for which management believes is not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating activities; (v) loss on extinguishment of debt, which is not reflective of the Company’s general business performance; and (vi) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, which is not be applicable to the Company’s future business activities. The Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA also includes the impact of distributions from investee received in bitcoin related to a return on the Nautilus investment, which management believes, in conjunction with excluding the impact of equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax, is reflective of assets available for the Company’s use in its ongoing operations as a result of its investment in Nautilus.\n\nManagement believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the foregoing to be the case even though some of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management does not believe any of such items are normal operating expenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenues). For example, the Company expects that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, directors and consultants. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenue.\n\nThe Company's Adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating loss or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Although management utilizes internally and presents Adjusted EBITDA, the Company only utilizes that measure supplementally and does not consider it to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by U.S. GAAP financial results. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure (i.e., net loss attributable to common stockholders) for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet loss attributable to common stockholders | $ | (23,033 | ) | $ | (19,371 | ) | $ | (44,100 | ) | $ | (63,692 | )  \nAdjustments to reconcile net loss attributable to common stockholders to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:  \nPreferred stock dividends | 300 | 272 | 878 | 796  \nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax | — | 68 | — | 106  \nEquity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax | 2,679 | (850 | ) | (3,363 | ) | 12,613  \nDistributions from investee, related to Nautilus | 3,395 | 6,739 | 22,482 | 11,682  \nIncome tax benefit | — | — | — | —  \nOther income | (339 | ) | (59 | ) | (1,286 | ) | (113 | )  \nLoss on extinguishment of debt | 4,273 | — | 6,300 | —  \nInterest expense | 409 | 10,251 | 16,779 | 25,535  \nDepreciation | 15,643 | 8,224 | 44,864 | 20,085  \nAmortization of right-of-use asset | 252 | 249 | 755 | 750  \nStock-based compensation expense | 2,408 | 1,413 | 14,181 | 4,023  \nRelated party expense to be settled with respect to common stock | — | 2,085 | — | 2,502  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 5,987 | $ | 9,021 | $ | 57,490 | $ | 14,287  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/6c3313b8-becc-419c-918e-1f19edf5b4fa/small/terawulf-final-jpg-1-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6c3313b8-becc-419c-918e-1f19edf5b4fa)\n\nSource: TeraWulf Inc. \n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [ Company Profile ](/company-information)\n  * [ Contacts ](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ RSS News Feed ](https://investors.terawulf.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

We are also working closely with Bitmain’s warranty department on a recovery plan to repair and replace 1.5 EH of mining equipment with a target completion by the end of the year. Furthermore, we have established a dedicated Business Development and Performance Optimization team, focused on integrating advanced IT and software solutions to improve our operational hash rate and overall efficiency. Building 5, which has been designed to handle higher heat exhaust of the latest generation miners, remains on track to be operational in Q1 2025.”\n\nFarrell added, “The proceeds from our recent sale of equity interest in Nautilus and successful convertible notes financing have positioned us to fast-track the expansion of our HPC and AI initiatives at Lake Mariner. We are targeting the delivery of 72.5 MW of HPC hosting capacity by the end of Q2 2025, which will allow us to meet the growing demand for high-performance computing solutions.”\n\n**Production and Operations****Update**\n\nAs of October 31, 2024, TeraWulf's operational bitcoin mining capacity included 195 MW at the Lake Mariner facility. With the reinstallation of XP miners from Nautilus underway, the Company expects its total self-mining hash rate to increase to approximately 8.7 EH/s.\n\nIn October, the Company’s miners operated at an average hash rate of 6.8 EH/s, with adjustments made for demand response events and performance optimization strategies to maximize profitability.\n\nOn the WULF Compute front, TeraWulf continues its rapid progress in large-scale HPC hosting infrastructure at Lake Mariner. Notable progress includes the recent completion of a 2.5 MW HPC/AI proof-of-concept project designed to accommodate current and next-gen GPU technology. Additionally, construction of CB-1, a 20 MW HPC hosting facility with Tier 3-grade redundancy features, is on schedule for completion in Q1 2025. Preparations for CB-2, a 50 MW HPC hosting facility, are also progressing as key components have already been secured, ensuring timely delivery by the end of Q2 2025.\n\n**About TeraWulf**\n\nTeraWulf develops, owns, and operates environmentally sustainable, next-generation data center infrastructure in the United States, specifically designed for Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. Led by a team of seasoned energy entrepreneurs, the Company owns and operates the Lake Mariner facility situated on the expansive site of a now retired coal plant in Western New York. Currently, TeraWulf generates revenue primarily through Bitcoin mining, leveraging predominantly zero-carbon energy sources, including nuclear and hydroelectric power. Committed to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles that align with its business objectives, TeraWulf aims to deliver industry-leading economics in mining and data center operations at an industrial scale.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

Accordingly, operating results of the Nautilus Cryptomine facility are not reflected in revenue, cost of revenue or cost of operations lines in TeraWulf’s consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses these metrics as indicators of operational progress and effectiveness and believes they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to provide comparisons to peer companies. All figures except Bitcoin Self-Mined are estimates and remain subject to standard month-end adjustments. 2 The Company sold its 25% equity interest in the Nautilus Cryptomine facility effective October 2, 2024.3 Computed as the weighted-average opening price of bitcoin on each respective day the Bitcoin Self-Mined is earned.4 While nameplate mining inventory as of October 31, 2024 for Lake Mariner is estimated at 8.1 EH/s, actual monthly hash rate performance depends on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) performance tuning to increase efficiency and maximize margin, scheduled outages (scopes to improve reliability or performance), unscheduled outages, curtailment due to participation in various cash generating demand response programs, derate of ASICS due to adverse weather and ASIC maintenance and repair. Performance in October is especially impacted by miner fleet upgrade work.5 Nameplate miner efficiency excludes auxiliary load.\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/6c3313b8-becc-419c-918e-1f19edf5b4fa/small/terawulf-final-jpg-1-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6c3313b8-becc-419c-918e-1f19edf5b4fa)\n\nSource: TeraWulf Inc. \n\nReleased November 4, 2024\n\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [ Company Profile ](/company-information)\n  * [ Contacts ](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ RSS News Feed ](https://investors.terawulf.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

(“TeraWulf,” the “Company,” “our” or “we”) is a leading digital asset technology firm that specializes in digital infrastructure and sustainable energy\ndevelopment. Our primary focus is supporting environmentally conscious bitcoin mining operations by developing and operating state-of-the-art facilities within the United\nStates. Our bitcoin mining facilities are powered by clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources, underscoring our commitment to sustainable practices within the\ncryptocurrency mining industry.\nRevenue Structure\nOur primary source of revenue stems from the mining of bitcoin conducted at our sustainable mining facility sites. Additionally, we occasionally generate revenue\nthrough the provision of miner hosting services to third-party entities. We exclusively engage in bitcoin mining for our own purposes and do not facilitate bitcoin transactions\nfor external parties.\nOur industrial-scale bitcoin mining operations are strategically designed to optimize efficiency. This involves continuously expanding our hash rate, which represents\nthe computational power dedicated to supporting the bitcoin blockchain. By doing so, we enhance our chances of successfully solving cryptographic hashes, thereby generating\nnew blocks on the bitcoin blockchain—a process commonly known as “solving a block.” Typically, a miner’s likelihood of solving a block and earning the block reward is\ndirectly linked to the proportion of the bitcoin blockchain’s total network hash rate that its hash rate represents.\nBlock rewards, which are fixed, undergo periodic reductions through halving events. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, reducing the block reward from\n12.5 to 6.25 bitcoin. Another halving, which is expected in April 2024, will further reduce the block reward to 3.125 bitcoin.\nIn addition to block rewards, bitcoin miners also earn transaction fees for confirming transactions. By validating unconfirmed transactions and incorporating them into\nnew blocks within the blockchain, miners collect these fees. While miners are not obliged to confirm specific transactions, economic incentives drive them to validate legitimate\ntransactions to earn fees. Historically, miners have accepted relatively low transaction fees, but these fees can vary, making future fee predictions challenging.\nPresently, we liquidate the bitcoin mined as part of our routine treasury management processes to acquire U.S. dollars for operational, capital, or other corporate\nexpenses. Our bitcoin holdings are securely stored in a cold storage wallet managed by our custodian, NYDIG Trust Company LLC, a duly chartered New York limited liability\ntrust company (“NYDIG”).\nFor our bitcoin mining operations, we utilize a third-party mining pool operated by Foundry Digital LLC (“Foundry”). At the close of each day, the bitcoin we have\nearned is transferred by Foundry to our custodial wallet address at NYDIG. We abstain from engaging in the direct sale of our bitcoin on any exchange. Instead, we rely on\nNYDIG to handle the sale of our mined bitcoin in accordance with our execution agreement with NYDIG, as detailed further in the “Risk Factors” section herein. Our bitcoin\nsales occur on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nBitcoin and Blockchain\nBitcoin, introduced in 2008, fundamentally transformed the landscape of digital currency by providing a decentralized mechanism for exchanging and preserving\nvalue. It operates on a consensus-based network, utilizing a public ledger termed as the \"blockchain\" to meticulously record every bitcoin transaction. TeraWulf's fully\nintegrated bitcoin mining facilities capitalize on zero-carbon energy sources, primarily sourced from baseload nuclear and hydroelectric power.\nBitcoin mining involves validating transactions through a proof-of-work consensus method, where miners solve complex mathematical problems to add transactions to\nthe blockchain. TeraWulf invests in computation networks (mining rigs) equipped with application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) chips and secures power to validate\ntransactions and maintain the bitcoin ledger. Factors such as computing capacity, electricity costs, and location play pivotal roles in mining operations.\n1\nTable of Contents\nOur Facilities\nTeraWulf currently conducts its bitcoin mining operations at two established data centers: the Lake Mariner facility in upstate New York (the “Lake Mariner Facility”)\nand the jointly owned Nautilus cryptomine facility located in central Pennsylvania (the “Nautilus Cryptomine Facility”). The Company has a total operational capacity of 210\nmegawatts (“MW”) and is currently constructing an additional 35 MW at its Lake Mariner Facility, which is expected to be operational in mid-2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 95% of TeraWulf’s mining operations were fueled by zero-carbon energy, reflecting our dedication to sustainability. The Company’s\nongoing objective is to achieve complete reliance on zero-carbon energy sources.\nLake Mariner Facility\nLocated at a site adjacent to the now decommissioned coal-fired power plant in Barker, New York, the Lake Mariner Facility began sustainably mining bitcoin in\nMarch 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Lake Mariner Facility is operating approximately 160 MW of bitcoin mining capacity at the site. The Company has an agreement in\nplace with the Power Authority of the State of New York (“NYPA”) for 90 MW of high load factor power to support its bitcoin mining operations (the “PPA”). The PPA was\nexecuted on February 12, 2022 and has a term of ten years from the date of commencement of NYPA’s power delivery. The Lake Mariner Facility is situated on an expansive\nsite on the shores of Lake Ontario and has the ability to scale up to 500 MW of capacity.\nNautilus Cryptomine Facility\nLocated in Berwick, Pennsylvania, Nautilus Cryptomine LLC (“Nautilus”) is a joint venture between TeraWulf and a subsidiary of Talen Energy Corporation\n(“Talen”). Nautilus currently owns a 200 MW bitcoin mining facility located adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt nuclear-powered Susquehanna Station. The Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility represents the first bitcoin mining facility site that is powered by 100% “behind the meter” zero-carbon nuclear energy, which is contracted at a fixed rate of 2.0 cents\nper kilowatt-hour for a term of five years with two successive three-year renewal options. Under the Nautilus joint venture agreement, the Company holds a 25% equity interest\nin Nautilus and Talen holds a 75% equity interest, each subject to adjustment based on relative capital contributions. TeraWulf began mining bitcoin at the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility in the first quarter of 2023 and, as of December 31, 2023, had 50 MW of operational bitcoin mining capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. On February 28,\n2024, the Company exercised its option to increase its energy requirement at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility by an incremental 50 MW (for a total of 100 MW attributable to\nTeraWulf).\nEnvironmental Considerations\nBitcoin mining, a process reliant on energy consumption to power computers for verifying and recording cryptocurrency transactions, often raises concerns regarding\nits environmental impact. Traditional mining operations fueled by fossil fuels contribute to carbon emissions, exacerbating climate change. In contrast, TeraWulf prioritizes\nsustainable practices, sourcing energy from non-fossil fuel and clean sources such as hydroelectric and nuclear power, which emit no carbon.\nAdditionally, our Lake Mariner Facility serves as a valuable tool for the grid operator to balance load with increasing contributions of renewable, and by definition\nintermittent, energy sources. In 2023, the Company participated in three ancillary demand response programs in New York, including the Commercial System Relief Program\n(CSRP), Demand Side Ancillary Services Program (DSASP), and Special Case Resource (SCR) program.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 95% of the energy utilized in our mining facilities came from clean sources, primarily hydro and nuclear power, and we are driving to\nachieve 100% zero-carbon powered operations. Below is a breakdown detailing the energy sources utilized to operate our bitcoin mining facilities for the year ended December\n31, 2023:\nNautilus Cryptomine\nPercentage of energy consumption by facility Lake Mariner Facility(1) Facility\nZero Carbon(2) 93.0% 100.0%\nCarbon(3) 7.0% 0.0%\nTotal 100.0% 100.0%\n2\nTable of Contents\n_______\n(1) Source: NYISO’s 2021-2040 System & Resource Outlook.\n(2) Zero carbon usage includes hydro, nuclear, solar and wind power resources.\n(3) Carbon usage includes coal and gas power resources.\nOur Strengths\nVertical Integration\nTeraWulf acknowledges the critical significance of owning its bitcoin mining facility sites for operational efficacy, leading to enhanced efficiency and reduced costs.\nEnergy infrastructure assets are inherently complex, requiring specialized equipment, intricate commercial relationships, and engagement with diverse stakeholder groups.\nThrough site ownership, TeraWulf adopts a comprehensive approach, ensuring projects are executed with due regard for safety, timeliness, and reliability. Moreover, vertical\nintegration empowers TeraWulf to uphold environmental responsibility and foster positive community relations. Ownership facilitates active management of site development,\nproject supply chains, and commercial agreements, thereby promoting transparency and accountability for employees, investors, and local communities.\nEnvironmentally Clean\nTeraWulf is steadfast in its commitment to spearheading sustainable bitcoin mining practices. Presently, 95% of the energy powering its two mining facilities is\nderived from zero-carbon sources, with a targeted transition to 100% zero-carbon energy usage. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility relies exclusively on 100% zero-carbon\nnuclear energy, while the Lake Mariner Facility draws power from Western New York, where over 93% of energy originates from zero-carbon resources, primarily hydro and\nnuclear. Recognizing the environmental ramifications of bitcoin mining, TeraWulf regards its access to cost-effective, zero-carbon energy as a significant and enduring\ncompetitive advantage relative to industry peers.\nLow-Cost Energy Supply\nTeraWulf anticipates maintaining one of the industry’s lowest electricity costs, estimated at approximately $0.035 per kilowatt-hour. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility\nsecures power at a fixed rate of $0.02 per kilowatt-hour for a five-year term, contributing to cost stability. Historically, at the Lake Mariner Facility, the cost of market power\nhas averaged approximately $0.040 per kilowatt-hour. Over the year ended December 31, 2023, the average aggregate power price at the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus\nCryptomine Facility was $0.032 per kilowatt-hour. Positioned at structurally congested points within their respective markets, these facilities offer opportunities for power\noptimization and provision of ancillary services to the electrical distribution grid.\nScale Rapidly with Proprietary Expansion Pipeline\nTeraWulf's growth trajectory is underpinned by access to the latest generation miners, competitive power arrangements, and profound expertise in energy infrastructure\nand operations. The Company’s existing facilities retain significant expansion capacity, with the Lake Mariner Facility capable of scaling up to 500 MW. Furthermore,\nTeraWulf plans to expand mining capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility by another 50 MW in 2025, solidifying its position for scalable growth.\nExperienced Team\nTeraWulf has an experienced executive management team with many years of experience designing, developing and operating energy infrastructure. Additionally,\nTeraWulf benefits from the support of Beowulf Electricity & Data Inc. (“Beowulf E&D”), overseen by TeraWulf’s CEO, ensuring the efficient development and operation of its\nmining facilities. With over 30 years of collective experience in overseeing large-scale energy facilities, the Beowulf E&D team brings invaluable expertise to TeraWulf's\noperations.\nCompetition\nWe classify our primary competitors as other publicly traded bitcoin miners due to the availability of information about their operations. Consequently, numerous\npublic companies, both traded in the U.S. and internationally, could be regarded as competitors of TeraWulf. However, we believe that none of these entities, including those\nlisted below, can match our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices and favorable unit economics.\n3\nTable of Contents\n• Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (MARA)\n• RIOT Platforms Inc. (RIOT)\n• Cleanspark Inc. (CLSK)\n• Hut 8 Mining Corp. (HUT)\n• Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (HIVE)\n• Bitfarms LTD . (BITF)\n• Iris Energy Limited (IREN)\n• Cipher Mining Inc. (CIFR)\n• Bit Digital Inc. (BTBT)\nWith the fluctuation of bitcoin prices, we acknowledge the potential for additional miners to enter the market during periods of price increases. Conversely, during\nperiods of price decline, less efficient miners may find it economically challenging to remain operational. We are confident TeraWulf maintains a competitive advantage by\noffering some of the most cost-effective unit economics in comparison to other publicly traded bitcoin miners.\nSuppliers\nWe specialize in high-efficiency bitcoin mining through the utilization of ASICs. These dedicated computing machines, commonly referred to as mining rigs, are\npredominantly produced by a select few manufacturers. The majority of the machines purchased and deployed by TeraWulf were manufactured by Bitmain, recognized as one\nof the foremost leaders in the production of bitcoin mining rigs worldwide.\nResearch and Development\nIn 2023, the Company established WULF Compute as its internal innovation center, with a specific focus on the research, development, and deployment of its\nexpansive and scalable digital infrastructure. Subsequent to a successful pilot phase involving a compact graphics processing unit (GPU) system designed to bolster generative\nAI and large language model applications, the Company made an initial commitment by allocating a 2 MW power block at the Lake Mariner Facility. This allocation is intended\nto support a broader high-performance computing (HPC) initiative, strategically aimed at diversifying the Company’s revenue streams.\nRegulation\nBitcoin mining currently operates within a predominantly unregulated environment, both at the state and federal levels. We anticipate a heightened focus on regulatory\noversight in the near future, and the potential ramifications of forthcoming regulations on our operations remain uncertain.\nTeraWulf conscientiously monitors public policy and relevant legislation across all jurisdictions in which we operate. Our primary objective is to provide policymakers\nwith informed insights and advocate for measures that promote the welfare of our employees and align with the overarching goals of the Company. Additionally, we\nstrategically engage with carefully selected industry associations to collaboratively advance our public policy and business objectives.\nIntellectual Property\nTeraWulf utilizes specific hardware and software tailored for its bitcoin mining operations. Given the prevalence of open-source technology in the blockchain and\ncryptocurrency sectors, certain source code and software components may be subject to open-source licenses. In such cases, we strictly adhere to the terms outlined in the\nrespective license agreements.\nAt present, TeraWulf neither possesses nor intends to pursue patents for its existing or planned blockchain and cryptocurrency operations. Instead, we rely on\nsafeguarding our interests through trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights. Additionally, we anticipate procuring\nlicenses for utilizing\n4\nTable of Contents\nintellectual property rights owned and managed by third parties. In the future, TeraWulf may develop proprietary software applications tailored for enhancing our blockchain\nand cryptocurrency operations.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of the filing date, TeraWulf has 10 full-time employees and officers. We recognize the pivotal role played by our workforce in the Company’s success and prioritize\ntheir well-being and dedication.\nTo support our employees, TeraWulf offers a comprehensive benefits program tailored to their needs. This program encompasses a 401(k) retirement plan, flexible\nwork hours, ample leave policies, and initiatives aimed at promoting mental and physical well-being. In accordance with our commitment to employee satisfaction, we conduct\nannual evaluations of our benefits offerings to ensure they remain aligned with the evolving needs of our workforce. Feedback from employees is actively sought to facilitate\ncontinuous improvement of our support systems.\nFurthermore, each member of the TeraWulf team holds ownership in the Company through equity awards granted under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the\n“Plan”). The primary objective of the Plan is to attract, retain, and motivate employees, executive officers, and directors through the provision of stock-based compensation\nawards.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nTeraWulf is dedicated to cultivating a diverse and inclusive workforce. We prioritize hiring and recruitment based on merit and qualifications, recognizing the inherent\nvalue of varied perspectives and experiences. As the Company expands, our commitment to diversity remains integral across all aspects of our operations.\nThe Company’s Diversity Policy serves as a fundamental framework, outlining TeraWulf’s commitment to fostering an inclusive environment where all individuals\nare treated with respect and esteem. We believe that embracing a range of perspectives not only enhances our organizational culture but also bolsters our capacity to respond to\nchange and stimulate innovation.\nCybersecurity\nTeraWulf has adopted a thorough strategy for information security and data governance, incorporating physical, procedural, and technical safeguards. These measures\naim to safeguard sensitive information and protect our mining operations against unauthorized access. The Company has established a cybersecurity risk management program\ndetailed in our Information Security and Cybersecurity Policy. This policy is designed to uphold the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and\ninformation.\nAs of the current filing date, we have not encountered significant impacts from recognized cybersecurity threats on our operations, business strategy, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nInsurance\nWe have property insurance coverage for our bitcoin miners with a total limit representing their estimated replacement cost. The total replacement cost values are\nevaluated on an on-going basis for the miners. Our miner insurance coverage also includes limited business interruption coverage for which we are continually evaluating the\nglobal market for alternative solutions. Currently, business interruption insurance for bitcoin mining companies is extremely limited. We also maintain replacement cost all-risk\ncoverage (excluding mechanical breakdown) property insurance for our facilities and equipment at our Lake Mariner Facility with a limit of $30 million per occurrence.\nFurthermore, we maintain a separate cyber liability insurance policy with an aggregate limit of $5 million. We engage our insurance broker annually to solicit underwriters to\nprovide proposals to renew our current coverages or update our policies to meet our needs.\nCorporate Information\nTeraWulf was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in February 2021 and commenced trading on Nasdaq under the symbol “WULF” on December 14,\n2021.

This summary does not address all of the risks we face.\nAdditional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below and should be carefully considered, together with\nother information included in this Annual Report. See “Item 1A— Risk Factors.”\nRisks Related to Our Business\n• If we fail to increase our hash rate, we may be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer.\n• We expect the cost of acquiring new miners to continue to be affected by the ongoing global supply chain crisis.\n• We may not be able to timely complete our future strategic growth initiatives or within our anticipated cost estimates, if at all.\n• We may be unable to access sufficient additional capital for future strategic growth initiatives.\n• Expansion of our Lake Mariner Facility or the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility potentially exposes us to additional risks.\n• Since the operation and expansion of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is subject to the terms of a joint venture agreement, TeraWulf may have less control over\nstrategic decisions.\n• If we are unable to comply with the covenants or restrictions contained in our Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement (the “LGSA”), the lenders could declare all\namounts outstanding under the LGSA to be due and payable and foreclose on their collateral, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and\noperations.\n• We have financed our strategic growth primarily by issuing new shares of our common stock in public offerings, which dilutes the ownership interests of our\ncurrent stockholders, and which may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\n• We have a history of operating losses, and we may report additional operating losses in the future.\n• The lack of regulation of digital asset exchanges which bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are traded on may expose us to the effects of negative publicity resulting\nfrom fraudulent actors in the cryptocurrency space and can adversely affect an investment in the Company.\nRisks Related to the Price of Bitcoin\n• Our ability to achieve profitability is largely dependent on the price of bitcoin, which has historically been volatile.\n7\nTable of Contents\n• Bitcoin market exposure to financially troubled cryptocurrency-related companies may impact our reputation, the price of bitcoin and the profitability of our bitcoin\nmining operations.\n• Bitcoin is subject to halving, and our bitcoin mining operations may generate less revenue as a result.\n• Transaction fees may decrease demand for bitcoin and prevent expansion.\n• Bitcoin faces significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.\nRisks Related to our Operations\n• To remain competitive in our industry, we seek to grow our hash rate to match the growing network hash rate and increasing network difficulty of the bitcoin\nblockchain, and if we are unable to grow our hash rate at pace with the global network hash rate, our chance of earning bitcoin from our mining operations would\ndecline.\n• Because our miners are designed specifically to mine bitcoin and may not be readily adaptable to other uses, a sustained decline in bitcoin’s value could adversely\naffect our business and results of operations.\n• Our reliance on third-party miners may subject our operations to an increased risk of design flaws.\n• Our use of a third-party mining pool exposes us to certain risks.\n• We may not be able to realize the benefits of forks.\n• Cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations and trigger significant liability for us, which could harm our operating results and financial\ncondition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\n• Incorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible and we could lose access to our bitcoin.\n• Our business could be harmed by prolonged power and internet outages, shortages, or capacity constraints.\n• Digital assets held by the Company are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement\n• Changing environmental regulation and public energy policy may expose our business to new risks.\n• Regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our business,\nprospects, or operations.\n• Our interactions with a blockchain may expose us to specially designated nationals (“SDN”) or blocked persons and new legislation or regulation could adversely\nimpact our business or the market for cryptocurrencies.\n• Bitcoin and bitcoin mining, as well as cryptocurrencies generally, may be made illegal in certain jurisdictions, including the ones we operate in, which could\nadversely affect our business prospects and operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\n• The trading price of shares of our common stock has been subject to volatility.\n• We have, primarily, financed our strategic growth through our at-the-market (“ATM”) offerings and issuances of our common stock. Holders of our common stock\nmay experience dilution as a result of such issuances.\n• We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or\notherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal\n8\nTable of Contents\ncontrols, any of which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report.\nIf any of the risks or uncertainties described herein actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely\naffected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we have described\nare not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business\noperations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we fail to increase our hash rate, we may be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer.\nGenerally, a bitcoin miner’s chance of solving a block on the bitcoin blockchain and earning a bitcoin reward is a function of the miner’s hash rate (i.e., the amount of\ncomputing power devoted to supporting the bitcoin blockchain), relative to the global network hash rate. As greater adoption of bitcoin occurs, we expect the demand for bitcoin\nwill increase further, drawing more mining companies into the industry and thereby increasing the global network hash rate. As new and more powerful miners are deployed,\nthe global network hash rate will continue to increase, meaning a miner’s chance of earning bitcoin rewards will decline unless it deploys additional hash rate at pace with the\nindustry. Accordingly, to compete in this highly competitive industry, we believe we will need to continue to acquire new miners, both to replace those lost to ordinary wear-\nand-tear and other damage, and to increase our hash rate to keep up with a growing global network hash rate.\nWe plan to increase our hash rate by acquiring newer, more effective and energy-efficient miners. These new miners are highly specialized servers that are very\ndifficult to produce at scale. As a result, there are limited producers capable of producing large numbers of sufficiently effective miners, and, as demand for new miners has\nincreased in response to increased bitcoin prices, we have observed the price of these new miners has increased. If we are unable to acquire enough new miners or access\nsufficient capital to fund our acquisitions, the results of our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, as could investments in our securities.\nWe expect the cost of acquiring new miners to continue to be affected by the ongoing global supply chain crisis.\nSimilarly, the ongoing global supply chain crisis, coupled with increased demand for computer chips, has created a shortfall of semiconductors, resulting in challenges\nfor the supply chain and production of the miners we employ in our bitcoin mining operations. The miners are highly specialized servers built around ASIC chips, which very\nfew manufacturers are able to produce in sufficient scale and quality to suit our operations. As a result, the cost to produce these miners has increased, and their manufacturers\nhave passed on increased costs of production to purchasers like us. Therefore, until the global supply chain crisis is resolved, and these extraordinary pressures are alleviated,\nwe expect to continue to incur higher than usual costs to obtain and deploy new miners, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to timely complete our future strategic growth initiatives or within our anticipated cost estimates, if at all.\nWhile our present expansion projects are proceeding on track with our expectations, we cannot guarantee we will complete these expansions (or any future strategic\ngrowth initiatives) on time or within our cost estimates, if at all, due in part to the ongoing effects of the global supply chain crisis related to macroeconomic effects of COVID-\n19, increased inflation and changing conditions within the United States labor market. If we are unable to complete our planned expansions on schedule and within our\nanticipated cost estimates, our deployment of newly purchased miners may be delayed, which could affect our competitiveness and our results of operation, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and the market price for our securities.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unable to access sufficient additional capital for future strategic growth initiatives.\nThe expansion of our miner fleet and expansion of our existing mining facilities are capital-intensive projects, and we anticipate that future strategic growth initiatives\nwill likewise continue to be capital-intensive. We expect to raise additional capital to fund these and other future strategic growth initiatives; however, we may be unable to do\nso in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities, or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise the additional capital needed to execute our future strategic growth\ninitiatives, we may be less competitive in our industry and the results of our operations and financial condition may suffer, and the market price for our securities may be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nExpansion of our Lake Mariner Facility and Nautilus Cryptomine Facility potentially exposes us to additional risks.\nExpansion of our existing mining facilities potentially exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to, among other sources: construction delays; lack of\navailability of parts and/or labor, increased prices as a result, in part, of inflation, and delays for data center equipment; labor disputes and work stoppages, including\ninterruptions in work due to pandemics, epidemics, and other health risks; unanticipated environmental issues and geological problems; delays related to permitting and\napprovals to commence operations from public agencies and utility companies; and delays in site readiness leading to our failure to meet commitments made in connection with\nsuch expansion. All construction-related projects depend on the skill, experience, and attentiveness of our personnel throughout the design and construction process. Should a\ndesigner, general contractor, significant subcontractor or key supplier experience financial difficulties or other problems during the design or construction process, we could\nexperience significant delays, increased costs to complete the project and/or other negative impacts to our expected returns.\nIf we are unable to overcome these risks and additional pressures to complete our expansion and construction projects in a timely manner, if at all, we may not realize\ntheir anticipated benefits, and our business and financial condition may suffer as a result.\nSince the operation and expansion of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is subject to the terms of a joint venture agreement, TeraWulf may have less control over strategic\ndecisions.\nOn March 23, 2023, TeraWulf (Thales) LLC (“Thales”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a second amended and restated joint venture\nagreement for Nautilus with an affiliate of Talen. The Nautilus joint venture agreement provides that, except for certain specified matters, decisions are to be made by a majority\nvote of the board of managers. The board of managers is comprised of one manager appointed by Thales and four managers appointed by Talen. Any significant disagreements\nbetween partners on strategic decisions or the inability of the Talen affiliate to meet obligations to Nautilus or third parties may impede the Company’s ability to control aspects\nof the ongoing operation and future expansion of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.\nEconomic and geopolitical events may create increased uncertainty and price changes.\nWe are subject to price volatility and uncertainty due to geopolitical crises and economic downturns. Such geopolitical crises and global economic downturns may be a\nresult of invasion, or possible invasion by one nation of another, leading to increased inflation and supply chain volatility. Such crises will likely continue to have an effect on\nour ability to do business in a cost-effective manner. Inflation has caused the price of materials to increase leading to increased expenses to our business. Global crises and\neconomic downturns may also have the effect of discouraging investment in bitcoin as investors shift their investments to less volatile assets. Such shifts could have a materially\nadverse effect on our business, operations and the value of the bitcoin we mine.\nWe may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions due to global pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of disease and the resulting global supply chain crisis.\nGlobal trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to persist and may also have long-lasting adverse impact on us\nand our industry. There are continued risks arising from new pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of disease, and ongoing COVID-19 related issues which have exacerbated port\ncongestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of new miners, as well as critical materials needed for our\nexpansion plans. Further, miner manufacturers have been impacted by the constrained supply of the semiconductors used in the production of the highly specialized ASIC chips\nminers we rely on, and by increased labor costs to manufacture new miners as workforces and global supply chains continue to be affected\n10\nTable of Contents\nby COVID-19 and may further be impacted by global outbreaks of various epidemics or disease, ultimately leading to continually higher prices for new miners. Thus, until the\nglobal supply chain crisis is resolved, and these extraordinary pressures are alleviated, we expect to continue to incur higher than usual costs to obtain and deploy new miners,\nand we may face difficulties obtaining the new miners we need at prices or in quantities we find acceptable, if at all, and our business and results of operations may suffer as a\nresult.\nIn addition, labor shortages that have persisted since the COVID-19 pandemic and those arising from any new pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of disease may lead\nto increased labor costs and difficulty in hiring and retaining the highly qualified and motivated people we need to conduct our business and execute on our strategic growth\ninitiatives. Sustaining our growth plans will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce, and\ngovernment cooperation, each of which may be affected by macroeconomic factors outside of our immediate control.\nWe cannot predict the duration or direction of current or new global trends or their sustained impact. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to\nremain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our\nworkforce and capital resources accordingly. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is\ncommensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations, our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results may be\nharmed.\nFailure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations.\nStrategic acquisitions and/or combinations are a component of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to\nintegrate the acquired business and realize anticipated synergies. Integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties, may require a disproportionate amount of\nour management’s attention, and may require us to reallocate our resources, financial or otherwise.\nFor example, we may encounter challenges in the integration process such as: difficulties associated with managing the resulting larger and more complex company;\nconforming administrative and corporate structures and standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures, hiring and retention of key employees, and compensation\nand benefits structures, coordinating geographically dispersed operations; and our ability to deliver on our strategy going forward.\nFurther, our acquisitions may subject us to new liabilities and risks, some of which may be unknown. Although we and our advisors conduct due diligence on the\noperations of businesses we consider acquiring, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all the liabilities of an acquired company. These liabilities, and any additional\nrisks and uncertainties related to an acquired company not known to us or that we may deem immaterial or unlikely to occur at the time of the acquisition, could negatively\nimpact our future business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies.\nThe failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience increased compliance costs as a result of our strategic acquisitions.\nFuture strategic acquisitions could carry substantial compliance burdens, which may limit our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, and which\nmay require our management and personnel to shift their focus to such compliance burdens and away from their other functions. Such increased costs and compliance burdens\ncould affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such strategic acquisitions, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may suffer as a result.\nIf we are unable to comply with the covenants or restrictions contained in our Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement, the lenders could declare all amounts outstanding\nthereunder to be due and payable and foreclose on their collateral, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe covenants and other restrictions contained in the Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2021, between the Company, the Lenders party\nthereto and Wilmington Trust National Association, as administrative and collateral agent (as amended, the “LGSA”) or future debt agreements could, among other things,\nrestrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or\nadvances, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react\nto market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities. In addition, our mined bitcoin, together with all of our Company’s other\nassets, serves as collateral for our lenders under our LGSA. A failure to comply with any restrictions or covenants in our LGSA, or to make payments of interest when due or\nmake other payments we are obligated to make under our LGSA, could have serious consequences to our financial condition or result in a default under the LGSA. A default\nwould permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt and to foreclose upon collateral securing the debt, among other remedies.\nWe have financed our strategic growth primarily by issuing new shares of our common stock in public offerings, which dilutes the ownership interests of our current\nstockholders, and which may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nWe have raised capital to finance the strategic growth of our business through public offerings of our common stock, and we expect to raise additional capital through\nsimilar public offerings to finance the completion of current and future expansion initiatives. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable\nterms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely impact our existing operations. In 2022 and 2023, a number of digital asset platforms and exchanges filed for\nbankruptcy and/or became the subjects of investigation by various governmental agencies for, among other things, fraud. These disruptions in the crypto asset market may\nimpact our ability to obtain favorable financing. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests, and the per share\nvalue of our common stock could decline. If we are unable to generate cash flows from operation sufficient to support our strategic growth, we may be required to adopt one or\nmore alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, or obtaining additional equity financing on terms that may be onerous or\nhighly dilutive. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, as we currently do, the holders of any debt we issue would likely have priority over the holders of shares of our\ncommon stock in terms of order of payment preference. We may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or take other actions\nincluding accepting terms that require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios that could otherwise not be in the interests of our stockholders.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may report additional operating losses in the future.\nOur primary business is bitcoin mining, and we have recorded historical losses and negative cash flows from our operations when the value of bitcoin we mine does not\nexceed our associated costs. Further, as part of our strategic growth plans, we have made capital investments in expanding our bitcoin mining operations. However, future\nmarket prices of bitcoin are difficult to predict, and we cannot guarantee that our future bitcoin mining revenue will exceed our associated costs.\nThe lack of regulation of digital asset exchanges which bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are traded on may expose us to the effects of negative publicity resulting from\nfraudulent actors in the cryptocurrency space and can adversely affect an investment in the Company.\nThe digital asset exchanges on which bitcoin is traded are relatively new and largely unregulated. Many digital asset exchanges do not provide the public with\nsignificant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices, or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence\nin, or may experience problems relating to, such digital asset exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. In\n2022 and 2023, a number of digital asset exchanges filed for bankruptcy proceedings and/or became the subjects of investigation by various governmental agencies for, among\nother things, fraud, causing a loss of confidence and an increase in negative publicity for the digital asset ecosystem. As a result, many digital asset markets, including the market\nfor bitcoin, have experienced increased price volatility. The bitcoin ecosystem may continue to be negatively impacted and experience long term volatility if public confidence\ndecreases.\nThese events are continuing to develop and it is not possible to predict, at this time, every risk that they may pose to us, our service providers, or the digital asset\nindustry as a whole. A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business failure,\nhackers or\n12\nTable of Contents\nmalware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential\nconsequences of a digital asset exchange’s failure could adversely affect our business and an investment in the Company.\nWe depend on attracting and retaining officers, managers, and skilled professionals.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to hire, retain and motivate talented officers, leadership, and professionals. We cannot guarantee that such employees\nwill be retained which may inhibit our management functions, strategic development, and other critical functions. Our growth may be constrained by human capital resource\nlimitations as we compete with other companies for skilled employees. We will need to take strategic action to develop our pool of management and skilled employees as well\nas grow such pool to meet the demands of our corporate functions. If we are not able to do so, our business, and thus our ability to grow, may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Price of Bitcoin\nOur ability to achieve profitability is largely dependent on the price of bitcoin, which has historically been volatile.\nOur existing bitcoin mining operations and the expansions of our Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility are largely based on our assumptions\nregarding the future value of bitcoin, which has been subject to significant historical volatility and may be subject to influence from malicious actors, real or perceived scarcity\nof bitcoin, political, economic, and regulatory conditions and speculation making bitcoin’s price more volatile or creating “bubble” type risks for the trading price of bitcoin.\nFurther, unlike traditional stock exchanges, which have listing requirements and vet issuers, requiring companies to comply with rigorous listing standards and rules, which\nmonitor transactions for fraud and other improprieties, markets for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tend to be unregulated or underregulated. In general, less stringent markets\nare perceived to have a higher risk of fraud or manipulation and any lack of oversight or perceived lack of transparency could reduce confidence in the price of bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies, which could adversely affect the price of bitcoin. As discussed in Item 1. “Business—Regulation” of this Annual Report, bitcoin and crypto asset markets\ngenerally may be subject to increased scrutiny and regulation by the U.S. legislature and government agencies, and such evolving regulatory and legal environment may impact\nour bitcoin mining activities and therefore an impact on our business.\nThese factors make it difficult to accurately predict the future market price of bitcoin and may also inhibit consumer trust in, and market acceptance of,\ncryptocurrencies as a means of exchange, which could limit the future adoption of bitcoin and, as a result, our assumptions could prove incorrect. If our assumptions prove\nincorrect and the future price of bitcoin is not sufficiently high, our revenue from our bitcoin mining operations may not exceed our costs, and our operations may not be\nprofitable, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBitcoin market exposure to financially troubled cryptocurrency-related companies may impact our reputation, the price of bitcoin and the profitability of our bitcoin mining\noperations.\nThe failure of several cryptocurrency platforms has impacted and may continue to impact the broader cryptocurrency economy; the full extent of these impacts may\nnot yet be known. Bitcoin is subject to price volatility resulting from financial instability, poor business practices, and fraudulent activities of players in the broader\ncryptocurrency market. When investors in cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency-based companies experience financial difficulty as a result of price volatility, poor business\npractices, and/or fraud, it has caused, and may continue to cause, loss of confidence in the cryptocurrency space, reputational harm to cryptocurrency assets, heightened scrutiny\nby regulatory authorities and law makers, and a steep decline in the value of bitcoin, among other material impacts. Such adverse effects have affected, and may in the future,\naffect the profitability of our bitcoin mining operations.\nBitcoin is subject to halving, and our bitcoin mining operations may generate less revenue as a result.\nThe number of new bitcoin awarded for solving a block is cut in half at mathematically predetermined intervals, known as “halving”. The next halving for the bitcoin\nblockchain is currently anticipated to occur in April 2024. While bitcoin prices have historically increased around these halving events, there is no guarantee that the price\nchange will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining rewards. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of bitcoin does not follow future\nhalving events, the revenue we earn from our bitcoin mining operations would see a decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n13\nTable of Contents\nTransaction fees may decrease demand for bitcoin and prevent expansion.\nAs the number of bitcoin currency rewards granted for solving a block in the bitcoin blockchain has decreased, transaction fees have increasingly been used to\nincentivize miners to continue to contribute to the bitcoin network. However, high bitcoin transaction fees may slow the adoption of bitcoin as a means of payment, which may\ndecrease demand for bitcoin and future prices of bitcoin may suffer as a result. If bitcoin prices are not sufficiently high, our bitcoin mining revenue may not exceed our\nassociated costs, and our results of operations and financial condition may suffer. Further, because the price of shares of our common stock may be linked to the price of\nbitcoin, if demand for bitcoin decreases, causing future bitcoin prices to decrease, the market price of our securities may be materially and adversely affected, limiting our ability\nto raise additional capital to fund our strategic growth plans and would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBitcoin faces significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.\nBitcoin (and cryptocurrencies, generally) face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times and attempts to increase the\nvolume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling cryptocurrencies is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, including bitcoin.\nMany cryptocurrency networks face significant scaling challenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second.\nParticipants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem debate potential approaches to increasing the average number of transactions per second that a network can handle and have\nimplemented mechanisms or are researching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, and\nsharding (a horizontal partition of data in a database or search engine), which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single miner’s or validator’s\nblock. There is, however, no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of cryptocurrency transactions will be\neffective. If adoption of bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies, generally) as a means of payment does not occur on the schedule or scale we anticipate, the demand for bitcoin may\nstagnate or decrease, which could adversely affect future bitcoin prices, and our results of operations and financial condition, which could have a material adverse effect on the\nmarket price for our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nTo remain competitive in our industry, we seek to grow our hash rate to match the growing network hash rate and increasing network difficulty of the bitcoin blockchain,\nand if we are unable to grow our hash rate at pace with the global network hash rate, our chance of earning bitcoin from our mining operations would decline.\nAs the adoption of bitcoin has increased, the price of bitcoin has generally appreciated, causing the demand for new bitcoin rewards for successfully solving blocks on\nthe bitcoin blockchain to likewise increase. This has encouraged more miners to attempt to mine bitcoin, which increases the global network hash rate deployed in support of the\nbitcoin blockchain.\nBecause a miner’s relative chance of successfully solving a block and earning a new bitcoin reward is generally a function of the ratio of the miner’s individual hash\nrate relative to the global network hash rate, as the global network hash rate increases, a miner must increase its individual hash rate to maintain its chances of earning new\nbitcoin rewards. Therefore, as new miners enter the industry and as miners deploy greater numbers of increasingly powerful machines, existing miners must seek to continually\nincrease their hash rate to remain competitive. Thus, a feedback loop is created: as bitcoin gains popularity and its relative market price increases, more miners attempt to mine\nbitcoin and the bitcoin network hash rate is increased; in response, existing miners and new miners devote more and more hash rate to the bitcoin blockchain by deploying\ngreater numbers of increasingly powerful machines in an attempt to ensure their ability to earn additional bitcoin rewards does not decrease. Compounding this feedback loop,\nthe network difficulty of the bitcoin network (i.e., the amount of work (measured in hashes) necessary to solve a block) is periodically adjusted to maintain the pace of new\nblock additions (with one new block added to the blockchain approximately every ten minutes), and thereby control the supply of bitcoin. As miners deploy more hash rate and\nthe bitcoin network hash rate is increased, the bitcoin network difficulty is adjusted upwards by requiring more hash rate to be deployed to solve a block. Thus, miners are\nfurther incentivized to grow their hash rate to maintain their chance of earning new bitcoin rewards. In theory, these dual processes should continually replicate themselves until\nthe supply of available bitcoin is exhausted. In response, miners have attempted to achieve greater hash rate by deploying increasingly sophisticated and expensive miners in\never greater quantities. Moreover, because there are very few manufacturers of miners capable of producing a sufficient number of miners of adequate quality to meet this need,\nscarcity results, leading to higher prices. Compounding this phenomenon, it\n14\nTable of Contents\nhas been observed that some manufacturers of bitcoin miners may increase the prices for new miners as the market price of bitcoin increases.\nAccordingly, to maintain our chances of earning new bitcoin rewards and remaining competitive in our industry, we must seek to continually add new miners to grow\nour hash rate at pace with the growth in the bitcoin global network hash rate. However, as demand has increased and scarcity in the supply of new miners has resulted, the price\nof new miners has increased sharply, and we expect this process to continue in the future as demand for bitcoin increases. Therefore, if the price of bitcoin is not sufficiently\nhigh to allow us to fund our hash rate growth through new miner acquisitions and if we are otherwise unable to access additional capital to acquire these miners, our hash rate\nmay stagnate and we may fall behind our competitors. If this happens, our chances of earning new bitcoin rewards would decline and, as such, our results of operations and\nfinancial condition may suffer.\nBecause our miners are designed specifically to mine bitcoin and may not be readily adaptable to other uses, a sustained decline in bitcoin’s value could adversely affect\nour business and results of operations.\nWe have invested substantial capital in acquiring miners using ASIC chips designed specifically to mine bitcoin using the 256-bit secure hashing algorithm (“SHA-\n256”) as efficiently and as rapidly as possible on our assumption that we will be able to use them to mine bitcoin and generate revenue from our operations. Therefore, our\nbitcoin mining operations focus exclusively on mining bitcoin, and our bitcoin mining revenue is based on the value of the bitcoin we mine. Accordingly, if the value of bitcoin\ndeclines and fails to recover, for example, because of the development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies, including competing cryptocurrencies\nwhich our miners may not be able to mine, the revenue we generate from our bitcoin mining operations will likewise decline. Moreover, because our miners use these highly\nspecialized ASIC chips, we may not be able to successfully repurpose them in a timely manner, if at all, to other uses, following a sustained decline in bitcoin’s value or if the\nbitcoin blockchain stops using SHA-256 for solving blocks. This would result in a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially impact our ability to continue as\na going concern.\nOur reliance on third-party miners may subject our operations to increased risk of design flaws.\nThe performance and reliability of our miners and our technology is critical to our reputation and our operations. We currently predominantly use Bitmain\nTechnologies Limited (“Bitmain”) miners, and if there are issues with those machines, such as a design flaw in the ASIC chips they employ, our system could be substantially\naffected. Any system error or failure may significantly delay response times or even cause our system to fail. Any disruption in our ability to continue mining could result in\nlower yields and harm our reputation and business. Any exploitable weakness, flaw, or error common to the Bitmain miners we currently utilize could affect substantial\nportions of our miners; therefore, if a defect or other flaw exists and is exploited, a majority of, or all of our miner fleet could be adversely impacted. Any interruption, delay or\nsystem failure could result in financial losses, a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and damage to our reputation.\nOur use of a third-party mining pool exposes us to certain risks.\nWe receive bitcoin rewards from our mining activity through a third-party mining pool operator, Foundry. Mining pools allow miners to combine their processing\npower, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool operator, proportionally to our contribution to the\npool’s overall mining power, after deducting the applicable pool fee, if any, used to solve a block on the bitcoin blockchain. Should the pool operator’s system suffer downtime\ndue to a cyber-attack, software malfunction or other issue, it could negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue, if we are unable to quickly switch to another pool\nor to self-mine without a pool. Furthermore, it is possible that the mining pool operator could fail to accurately record the total processing power provided to the pool for a given\nbitcoin mining application, which would inhibit our ability to confirm the proportion of that total processing power which we provided. While we have internal methods of\ntracking both the hash rate we provide and the total used by the pool, the mining pool operator uses its own record-keeping to determine our proportion of a given reward,\nwhich may not match our own. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our mining pool operator, we may not receive accurate block\nrewards from the pool, and we would have limited recourse to correct these inaccuracies. This could lead us to decide against further participation in a mining pool, or mining\npools generally, which may affect the predictability of our mining returns, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe currently do not have a back-up pool provider, so if Foundry were to cease operations, there would be some delay and consequently lost revenue until we retained a\nnew pool provider and pointed our miners at the new pool provider,\n15\nTable of Contents\nwhich we would do by using a mass command issued by our management software. Furthermore, while we receive daily reports from Foundry detailing the total processing\npower provided to its mining pool and our proportion of that total processing power to determine the distribution of rewards to us, we are dependent on the accuracy of\nFoundry’s record keeping. We have little means of recourse against Foundry if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by Foundry is incorrect, other than\nleaving Foundry’s pool altogether. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our pools, we may experience reduced rewards for our efforts,\nwhich would have an adverse effect on our business and operations. Additionally, were Foundry to cease operations, declare insolvency or file for bankruptcy, there is a\nreasonable risk that recovery of any mining rewards or fees for any given day that had not yet been delivered into our wallet held at NYDIG would be delayed or\nunrecoverable.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of forks.\nThe bitcoin blockchain is subject to modification based on a consensus of the users on its network. When a significant minority of users on the network agree to a\nmodification that is not compatible with the prior network protocol, a “fork” of the network results, with one prong running the pre-modified protocol and the other running the\nmodified protocol. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two “versions” of the blockchain running in parallel that are not interchangeable, which requires\nexchange-type transactions to convert between the two forks. Additionally, it may be unclear following a fork which of the two protocols represents the original and which is\nthe new protocol. Different metrics adopted by industry participants to determine which is the original asset following a fork in the bitcoin blockchain may include: referring to\nthe blockchain with the greatest network hash rate, or to the “length” of blockchain (i.e., the time between the first transaction recorded in the blockchain’s distributed ledger\nand the date of the most recent transaction). Accordingly, it is possible that a fork may occur on the bitcoin blockchain that results in an asset different from our current bitcoin\nholdings, or a protocol different from SHA-256 (which our miners are specifically designed to operate), gaining predominance, and the value of our bitcoin assets may suffer,\nor we may not be able to adapt our miners to the new protocol. Therefore, we may not realize the economic benefit of a fork in the bitcoin blockchain, either immediately or\never, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.\nCyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations and trigger significant liability for us, which could harm our operating results and financial\ncondition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\nAs a publicly traded company, at times we experience cyber-attacks, such as phishing, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems, and we anticipate\ncontinuing to be subject to such attempts. There is an ongoing risk that some or all of our bitcoin could be lost or stolen as a result of one or more of these incursions. As we\nincrease in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats, and, despite our implementation of strict security\nmeasures, it is impossible to eliminate all such vulnerability. For instance, we may not be able to ensure the adequacy of the security measures employed by third parties, such\nas our service providers. Additionally, though we provide cybersecurity training for all employees, we cannot guarantee that we will not be affected by further phishing\nattempts. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and may not\nbe successful. Such breaches, whether attributable to a vulnerability in our systems or otherwise, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation and\nmaterially harm our business.\nWe rely on the well-known U.S. based third-party digital asset-focused custodian, NYDIG, to safeguard our bitcoin using cold storage. NYDIG receives and holds our\ncustodied assets, which includes both our digital assets and any cash we may choose to custody with NYDIG. Only NYDIG holds the private keys to our wallet, and no one at\nthe Company has access to our wallet’s private keys. If our third-party service provider experiences a security breach or cyber-attack and unauthorized parties obtain access to\nour bitcoin, we may lose some or all of our bitcoin and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. To date, we have not\nexperienced a material cyber incident; however, we continue to encounter ongoing cyber-attacks and the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject us to liability to\nour customers, suppliers, business partners and others, or give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, which could damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition.\nHowever, pursuant to our Digital Asset Custodial Agreement, dated as of March 10, 2022, between us and NYDIG (as may be amended, modified or supplemented\nfrom time to time, the “Custodial Agreement”), NYDIG has covenanted that it holds our digital assets in a segregated account that will at all times be identifiable in NYDIG’s\ndatabase as being stored for our benefit; that NYDIG has no right, interest or title in our digital assets; and that our digital assets do\n16\nTable of Contents\nnot constitute an asset on the balance sheet of NYDIG. To the extent NYDIG holds any cash on our behalf, NYDIG may hold our cash in one or more omnibus “for benefit of\ncustomers” accounts at one or more U.S. insured depository institutions. However, at this time, the Company has no cash custodied, and has no immediate or future plans to\ncustody, any cash with NYDIG. Furthermore, NYDIG has covenanted that our digital assets will not be commingled with other digital assets held by NYDIG, except\ntemporarily (typically for no longer than 12 hours, but in no case longer than 72 hours) as an operational matter, if required, to effect a transfer into or out of our digital asset\naccount. Significantly, NYDIG represents and warrants that beneficial and legal ownership of all our digital assets is, and will remain, freely transferable without the payment\nof money or value and that NYDIG has no ownership interest in our account.\nWhile we believe that the Custodial Agreement provides our business with reasonable protections for our business’s operations and the safe storage of our digital\nassets, we make no assurances that storing our digital assets with NYDIG is free from risk, given the various risks enumerated above. To the best of our knowledge, NYDIG\nsafely stores our digital assets in segregated accounts as represented in the Custodial Agreement; however, if NYDIG were to be in breach of the Custodial Agreement, our\ndigital assets could be compromised. Additionally, if NYDIG were to cease operations, declare insolvency or file for bankruptcy, there is a reasonable risk that recovery of our\nassets, though kept in segregated accounts, would be delayed or unrecoverable. Additionally, if NYDIG were to cease operations, declare insolvency or file for bankruptcy, we\ndo not have a readily available backup custodian at this time, and so we would need to self-custody our digital assets using cold storage until we could contract with another\nadequate custodian for the safe storage of our assets which may have a disruptive effect on our business. In the meantime, our mined bitcoin would continue to aggregate in our\nproprietary wallet until we found a suitable cold storage custodian.\nIncorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible and we could lose access to our bitcoin.\nBitcoin transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the bitcoin from the\ntransaction. Because of the decentralized nature of the bitcoin blockchain, once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the bitcoin blockchain,\nan incorrect transfer of a bitcoin or a theft thereof generally will not be reversible, and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft.\nIt is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, our bitcoin rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third\nparties, or to uncontrolled accounts. Though recent high profile enforcement actions against individuals laundering stolen bitcoin have demonstrated some means of bringing\nmalicious actors to justice for their theft, the stolen bitcoin is likely to remain unrecoverable. Furthermore, we utilize a third-party custodian for our bitcoin, and thus do not\nmaintain a private key. However, if they lose access to our wallet, or if a malicious actor successfully denies the third-party custodian access to our wallet, we may be\npermanently denied access to the bitcoin held in the wallet corresponding to the lost, stolen or blocked keys. Though we have taken and continue to take reasonable steps to\nsecure our data and to store our bitcoin with an institutional custodian, if we, or our third-party custodian were to experience data loss relating to our digital wallets, we could\neffectively lose access to and the ability to use our bitcoin assets. Moreover, we may be unable to secure insurance policies for our bitcoin assets at rates or on terms acceptable\nto us, if at all, and we may choose to self-insure. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed by prolonged power and internet outages, shortages, or capacity constraints.\nOur operations require a significant amount of electrical power and access to high-speed internet to be successful. If we are unable to secure sufficient electrical power,\nor if we lose internet access for a prolonged period, we may be required to reduce our operations or cease them altogether. If this occurs, our business and results of operations\nmay be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which may not be covered by insurance, and such events could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDigital assets held by the Company are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections.\nThe Company does not hold its digital assets with a banking institution or a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or the Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (“SIPC”) and, therefore, its digital assets are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices and the impacts of climate\nchange may result in additional costs or risks.\nCompanies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their ESG practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment\nfunds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their\ninvestments. Furthermore, increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, has resulted and may continue to result in\nincreased public scrutiny of our business and our industry, and our management team may divert significant time and energy away from our operations and towards responding\nto such scrutiny and reassuring our employees.\nThe SEC has adopted rule changes that require companies to include certain climate-related disclosures such as climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have\na material impact on business, results of operations, or financial conditions. Due to the adoption of these rules, the increased public scrutiny of our business may affect our\noperations, competitive position, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, demand for\nbitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and could increase our insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather\nevents or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted\nand impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on our operations, or if our operations are disrupted due to the physical impacts of climate change,\nour business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted. However, as a 95% zero-carbon bitcoin\nminer, we believe we are advantageously positioned relative to our competitors in this regard.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement\nChanging environmental regulation and public energy policy may expose our business to new risks.\nOur bitcoin mining operations require a substantial amount of power and can only be successful, and ultimately profitable, if the costs we incur, including for\nelectricity, are lower than the revenue we generate from our operations. As a result, any mining facility we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical\npower for that facility on a cost-effective basis, and our establishment of new facilities requires us to find locations where that is the case. If new regulations are imposed, or if\nexisting regulations are modified, the assumptions we made underlying our plans and strategic initiatives may be inaccurate, and we may incur additional costs to adapt our\nplanned business, if we are able to adapt at all, to such regulations.\nIn addition, there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty for our business because the bitcoin\nmining industry, with its energy demand, may become a target for future environmental and energy regulation. New legislation and increased regulation regarding climate\nchange could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and\nreporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Further, any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies\nsituated in areas not subject to such limitations.\nMoreover, in the State of New York, we currently participate in energy demand response programs to curtail operations, return capacity to the electrical grid, and\nreceive funds to offset foregone operational mining revenue when necessary, such as in extreme weather events. Furthermore, we, as well as other bitcoin miners, have recently\nreceived a mandatory survey from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), seeking extensive information regarding our facilities’ use of electricity, and certain\ninformation regarding our operations, solely for the month of January 2024. This request was subsequently withdrawn by the EIA; however, it is possible that mandatory\nsurveys such as this will be used by the EIA to generate negative reports regarding the bitcoin mining industry’s use of power and other resources, which could spur additional\nnegative public sentiment and adverse legislative and regulatory action against us or the bitcoin mining industry as a whole. Surveys and other regulatory actions could increase\nour cost of operations or otherwise make it more difficult for us to operate at our current locations.\nGiven the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed, and energy disclosure and use regulations, we\ncannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our\n18\nTable of Contents\nfinancial condition and results of operations in the future in the United States. However, as a 95% zero-carbon bitcoin miner, we believe we are advantageously positioned\nrelative to our competitors in this regard. Further, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential\nimpacts on climate change or energy use by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on\nour business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a highly-evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect our\nbusiness, reputation, prospects or operations.\nUntil recently, relatively little regulatory attention has been directed toward bitcoin and the bitcoin network by U.S. federal and state governments, foreign\ngovernments and self-regulatory agencies. We currently only operate in the United States, and do not currently have any plans to expand our operations beyond the United\nStates. As bitcoin has grown in popularity and in market size, the U.S. regulatory regime – namely the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., the\nSEC, the CFTC, FinCEN and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have begun to examine the operations of the bitcoin network, bitcoin users and the bitcoin exchange market.\nThe complexity and evolving nature of our business and the significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry requires us to exercise our\njudgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to us, and it is possible that governmental bodies and regulators may disagree with our conclusions. To the\nextent we have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, revocation of licenses, limitations on our products and services,\nreputational harm, and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the recent bankruptcy filings of FTX, the third largest digital asset exchange by volume at the time of its filing, and its affiliated hedge fund Alameda\nResearch LLC, in addition to other bankruptcy filings of crypto companies throughout calendar year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, together with the recent closures of\nSilicon Valley Bank, SBNY and Silvergate Bank, will likely attract heightened regulatory scrutiny from U.S. regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC. Increasing\nregulation and regulatory scrutiny may result in new costs for the Company and Company’s management having to devote increased time and attention to regulatory matters,\nchange aspects of the Company’s business or result in limits on the utility of bitcoin. In addition, regulatory developments and/or the Company’s business activities may require\nthe Company to comply with certain regulatory regimes. Increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements and any regulatory investigations and enforcement may result in\nchanges to our business, as well as increased costs, and supervision and examination for ourselves and our service providers. Moreover, new laws, regulations, or interpretations\nmay result in additional litigation, regulatory investigations, and enforcement or other actions. Adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations may\nhave an adverse effect on our reputation and brand and our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, although we are not directly connected to the recent cryptocurrency market events, we may still suffer reputational harm due to our association with the\ncryptocurrency industry in light of the recent disruption in the crypto asset markets. Ongoing and future regulation and regulatory actions could significantly restrict or eliminate\nthe market for or uses of bitcoin and/or may adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe compliance costs of responding to new and changing regulations could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the generation, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous\nsubstances and wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations also impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for investigation and cleanup costs on current and\nformer owners and operators of real property and persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. Our operations may involve the use of\nhazardous substances and materials, such as petroleum fuel for temporary generators, as well as batteries, cleaning solutions, and other materials.\nThe course of future legislation and regulation in the United States remains difficult to predict, and potential increased costs associated with new legislation or\nregulation cannot be estimated at this time.\n19\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects,\nor operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies; certain governments\nhave deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while some jurisdictions, such as the United States, subject the mining, ownership and\nexchange of cryptocurrencies to certain, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements.\nFor example, in January 2023, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and FDIC issued a joint statement effectively discouraging banks from\ndoing business with clients in crypto-asset industries, which could potentially create challenges regarding access to financial services. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve also\nissued a policy statement broadening its authority to cover state-chartered institutions. Moreover, in January 2023, the White House issued a statement cautioning deepening ties\nbetween crypto-assets and the broader financial system. Meanwhile, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has announced several actions aimed at\ncurtailing activities it deems sales of unregistered securities.\nHowever, also during January 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives announced its first ever Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets and the intention to\ndevelop a regulatory framework for the use and trade of digital assets and related financial services products in the United States. The bipartisan leadership of the Senate\nBanking Committee announced a similar objective.\nGiven the difficulty of predicting the outcomes of ongoing and future regulatory actions and legislative developments, it is possible that they could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nOur interactions with a blockchain may expose us to specially designated nationals (“SDN”) or blocked persons and new legislation or regulation could adversely impact\nour business or the market for cryptocurrencies.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with\npersons named on its SDN list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in\ntransactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Our Company’s policy prohibits any transactions with such SDN individuals, and we take all commercially reasonable\nsteps to avoid such transactions, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling\nbitcoin assets. Moreover, there is a risk that some bad actors will continue to attempt to use cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, as a potential means of avoiding federally\nimposed sanctions, such as those imposed in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nWe are unable to predict the nature or extent of new and proposed legislation and regulation affecting the bitcoin industry, or the potential impact of the use of bitcoin\nby SDN or other blocked or sanctioned persons, which could have material adverse effects on our business and our industry more broadly. Further, we may be subject to\ninvestigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties as a result of any regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm\nour reputation and affect the value of our common stock.\nBitcoin and bitcoin mining, as well as cryptocurrencies generally, may be made illegal in certain jurisdictions, including the ones we operate in, which could adversely\naffect our business prospects and operations.\nIt is possible that state or federal regulators may seek to impose harsh restrictions or total bans on bitcoin mining which may make it impossible for us to do business\nwithout relocating our mining operations, which could be very costly and time consuming. Further, although bitcoin and bitcoin mining, as well as cryptocurrencies generally,\nare largely unregulated in most countries (including the United States), regulators could undertake new or intensify regulatory actions that could severely restrict the right to\nmine, acquire, own, hold, sell, or use cryptocurrency or to exchange it for traditional fiat currency such as the United States Dollar. Such restrictions may adversely affect us as\nthe large-scale use of bitcoin as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account,\nand thus harm investors.\n20\nTable of Contents\nTeraWulf may be at a higher risk of litigation and other legal proceedings due to heightened regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, which could ultimately be\nresolved against TeraWulf, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair TeraWulf’s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of the Company’s business could make it susceptible to various claims, both in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings, legal\nproceedings, and government investigations, due to the heightened regulatory scrutiny following the recent disruptions in the crypto asset markets. The Company believes that\nsince cryptocurrency mining, and the digital asset industry generally, is a relatively new business sector, it is more likely subject to government investigation and regulatory\ndetermination, particularly following the recent cryptocurrency market participant bankruptcies described elsewhere herein. Any claims, regulatory proceedings or litigation that\ncould arise in the course of the Company’s business could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its business or operations, or the industry as a whole.\nThe Company may be classified as an inadvertent investment company.\nThe Company is not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and does not hold itself out as being engaged in those activities. Under the\nInvestment Company Act, however, a company may be deemed an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) if the value of its investment securities is more than 40% of\nits total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on a consolidated basis.\nThe Company will be engaging in digital asset mining, the outputs of which are cryptocurrencies, which may be deemed a security. In the event that the digital assets\nheld by the Company exceed 40% of its total assets, exclusive of cash, the Company may inadvertently become an investment company. An inadvertent investment company\ncan avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, namely Rule 3a-2 under the\nInvestment Company Act, allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (i) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash\nhaving a value exceeding 50% of the issuer’s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (ii) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire\ninvestment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nThe Company is putting in place policies that it expects will work to keep the digital assets held by the Company at less than 40% of its total assets, liquidating its digital assets\nor seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if the Company is unable to maintain sufficient total assets or liquidate sufficient digital assets in a timely manner.\nAs Rule 3a-2 is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusions are available to the Company, the Company would\nhave to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after it ceases being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit the Company’s ability to make certain\ninvestments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on the Company’s earnings. In any event, the Company does not intend to become an\ninvestment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\nClassification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to register, it would\nhave to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would require a restructuring of the\nCompany’s operations, and the Company would be very constrained in the kind of business it could do as a registered investment company. Furthermore, the Company would\nbecome subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports\nunder the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in the Company incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if\nrequired may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf federal or state legislatures or agencies initiate or release tax determinations that change the classification of bitcoins as property for tax purposes (in the context of\nwhen such bitcoins are held as an investment), such determination could have a negative tax consequence on the Company or its shareholders.\nCurrent guidance from the Internal Revenue Service indicates that digital assets such as bitcoin should be treated and taxed as property and that transactions involving\nthe payment of bitcoin for goods and services should be treated as barter transactions. While this treatment creates a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance\nwhere the ownership of a bitcoin passes from one person to another, usually by means of bitcoin transactions (including off-\n21\nTable of Contents\nblockchain transactions), it would also apply capital gains treatment to those transactions which may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of shares of our common stock has been subject to volatility.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile, and may be influenced by various factors including the risks, uncertainties\nand factors described in this Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC, as well as factors beyond our control or of which we may be unaware. If these risks happen and\nour business and results of operation suffer as a result, the market price of our securities may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on an investment in our\nsecurities.\nBitcoin is subject to price volatility resulting from financial instability, poor business practices, fraudulent activities of players in the market, and other factors outside\nof our control. Such factors may cause a decline in the price of bitcoin, which may affect the trading price of our shares of common stock. We have issued, and may continue to\nissue, new shares of our common stock, which has a dilutive effect.\nWe have, primarily, financed our strategic growth through our at-the-market (ATM) offerings and issuances of our common stock.\nOur ATM offerings allow us to raise capital as needed by tapping into the existing trading market for our shares by selling newly issued shares into the market\ndepending on prevailing market prices. Our efforts to raise capital is for the purpose of executing on development plans and strategic growth opportunities as they arise;\nhowever, holders of our common stock may experience dilution as a result of our sales of newly issued shares of our common stock in such ATM offerings.\nBecause we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell\nthem.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our\ncommon stock in the near future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. There is no assurance that\nstockholders will be able to sell shares when desired.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise\nfail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, any of which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our\nperiodic reporting obligations.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over\nfinancial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial\nreporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nBased on our assessment, as of December 31, 2023, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting contained no material weaknesses. To remediate previously\nidentified material weaknesses related to the Company’s review controls around classification within the consolidated statements of cash flows, our management has\nimplemented measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are timely remediated, such that these controls are designed,\nimplemented, and operating effectively.\nWe believe that our actions remediated our previously identified material weaknesses. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our\nreported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud\n22\nTable of Contents\nand the loss of assets, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nITEM 1B. Staff Comments\nWe have an unresolved comment from the staff (the “Staff”) of the SEC pursuant to a letter from the Staff to us, dated January 21, 2024, with respect to our\nRegistration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-274788), currently in review with the SEC, but not yet effective. On March 8, 2023, we have responded to this letter and\nhave amended our Registration Statement on Form S-3.\nITEM 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical\nsystems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program is one component of our information security program that guides continuous improvement to, and\nevaluates these security objectives for our critical systems, data, and operations. Additionally, our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident\nresponse plan. Our approach to controls and risk management is based on guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”). This does not mean that\nwe meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, but rather that we use the NIST framework as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage\ncybersecurity controls and risks relevant to our business.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels\nand governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n• identifying cybersecurity risks that could impact our facilities, third-party vendors/partners, operations, critical systems, information, and broader enterprise\ninformation technology environment. Risks are informed by threat intelligence, current and historical adversarial activity, and industry specify threats;\n• risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n• an Information Security and Cybersecurity policy which establishes administrative, physical, and technical controls and procedures to protect data and systems;\n• individuals, including employees and external third party service providers, who are responsible for managing our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, our\nsecurity controls, and our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n• the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test, monitor, respond or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\n• cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management; and\n• a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents.\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats that have materially affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition. We face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition. See “Risk Factors - Cyberattacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations and trigger significant liability for us, which could\nharm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.”\n23\nTable of Contents\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management\nprogram.\nThe Board receives regular reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Board, as necessary, regarding any material\ncybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential. The Board also receives briefings from management on our cyber risk management program.\nBoard members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our Vice President of Information Technology, risk management and internal security staff or external\nexperts as part of the Board’s continuing education on topics that impact public companies.\nOur management team is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The team has primary responsibility for our overall\ncybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our information security\norganization is comprised of internal and external security and technology professionals. We continue to make investments in information security resources to mature, expand,\nand adapt our capabilities to address emerging cybersecurity risks and threats. In addition, we have newly formed a multifunctional cybersecurity committee comprised of\ninformation technology, operations, risk, and finance members who will meet quarterly to assess new vulnerabilities and threats, update risk assessments and assess the\nimplementation of the Company’s cybersecurity risk management program. This committee will report periodically to the management team on matters involving cybersecurity\nrisks and incidents.\nOur management team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include\nbriefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants\nengaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the information technology environment.\nITEM 2. Properties\nCorporate Headquarters\nTeraWulf maintains its principal corporate offices in Easton, Maryland and New York, New York. Beowulf Electricity & Data Inc. (“Beowulf E&D”), a company\ncontrolled by TeraWulf’s CEO, provides TeraWulf with the office space at these locations in accordance with the terms of an Administrative and Infrastructure Services\nAgreement, dated as of April 27, 2021. Since January 1, 2023, the use of TeraWulf’s corporate offices is covered by the base fee under the Amendment No. 1 to the Services\nAgreement (as amended, the “Services Agreement”). TeraWulf considers its current office space adequate for its current operations.\nLake Mariner Facility\nLake Mariner has entered into a lease agreement with Somerset Operating Company, LLC (“Somerset”), a company controlled by TeraWulf’s CEO, pursuant to which\nLake Mariner leases from Somerset approximately 79 acres in Niagara County, New York for an initial term of eight years with a five-year extension option. Located on an\nexpansive site on the shores of Lake Ontario adjacent to the now decommissioned coal-fired power plant in Barker, New York, the Lake Mariner Facility began sustainably\nmining bitcoin in March 2022. The Lake Mariner Facility is operating approximately 160 MW of bitcoin mining capacity at the site as of December 31, 2023 and has the ability\nto scale up to 500 MW of capacity.\nNautilus Cryptomine Facility\nNautilus has entered into a ground lease with Cumulus Data LLC (“Cumulus Data”), an affiliate of Talen, pursuant to which Nautilus leases from Susquehanna Data\nLLC the site of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility for an initial term of five years with two three-year extension options and option to extend the term by an interim period of up\nto six and one half months after the first three-year extension. TeraWulf began mining bitcoin at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility in the first quarter of 2023 and, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, had 50 MW of operational bitcoin mining capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. On February 28, 2024, the Company exercised its option to\nincrease its energy requirement at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility by an incremental 50 MW (for a total of 100 MW attributable to TeraWulf). On March 1, 2024, Cumulus\nData sold substantially all its assets to an unaffiliated third party, including the land leased to Nautilus\n24\nTable of Contents\npursuant to the Nautilus ground lease. In connection with the asset sale, the Nautilus ground lease was assigned to the purchaser of the assets with no changes to its terms and\nconditions.\nITEM 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, TeraWulf may be involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of its business. Some of\nthese proceedings, lawsuits or claims may be material and involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties and could result in damages, fines,\npenalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. TeraWulf recognizes provisions for claims or pending litigation when it determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the\namount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from\nestimates. TeraWulf is not subject to any material pending legal and administrative proceedings, lawsuits or claims as of the date of this Annual Report. TeraWulf’s business\nand operations are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against TeraWulf.\nITEM 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the other Items included in\nthis Annual Report and with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. All figures presented below represent\nresults from continuing operations, unless otherwise specified. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report to the “Company,” “TeraWulf,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to\nTeraWulf Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Certain statements contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nmay be deemed forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”\n28\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nWe are a leading digital asset technology firm that specializes in digital infrastructure and sustainable energy development. Our primary focus is supporting\nenvironmentally conscious bitcoin mining operations by developing and operating state-of-the-art facilities within the United States. Our bitcoin mining facilities are powered by\nclean, affordable, and reliable energy sources, underscoring our commitment to sustainable practices within the cryptocurrency mining industry.\nRevenue Structure\nOur primary source of revenue stems from the mining of bitcoin conducted at our sustainable mining facility sites. Additionally, we occasionally generate revenue\nthrough the provision of miner hosting services to third-party entities. We exclusively engage in bitcoin mining for our own purposes and do not facilitate bitcoin transactions\nfor external parties.\nOur industrial-scale bitcoin mining operations are strategically designed to optimize efficiency. This involves continuously expanding our hash rate, which represents\nthe computational power dedicated to supporting the bitcoin blockchain. By doing so, we enhance our chances of successfully solving cryptographic hashes, thereby generating\nnew blocks on the bitcoin blockchain—a process commonly known as “solving a block.” Typically, a miner’s likelihood of solving a block and earning the block reward is\ndirectly linked to the proportion of the bitcoin blockchain's total network hash rate that its hash rate represents.\nBlock rewards, which are fixed, undergo periodic reductions through halving events. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, reducing the block reward from\n12.5 to 6.25 bitcoin. Another halving, which is expected in April 2024, will further reduce the block reward to 3.125 bitcoin.\nIn addition to block rewards, bitcoin miners also earn transaction fees for confirming transactions. By validating unconfirmed transactions and incorporating them into\nnew blocks within the blockchain, miners collect these fees. While miners are not obliged to confirm specific transactions, economic incentives drive them to validate legitimate\ntransactions to earn fees. Historically, miners have accepted relatively low transaction fees, but these fees can vary, making future fee predictions challenging.\nPresently, we liquidate the bitcoin mined as part of our routine treasury management processes to acquire U.S. dollars for operational, capital, or other corporate\nexpenses. Our bitcoin holdings are securely stored in a cold storage wallet managed by our custodian, NYDIG Trust Company LLC, a duly chartered New York limited liability\ntrust company (“NYDIG”).\nFor our bitcoin mining operations, we utilize a third-party mining pool operated by Foundry Digital LLC (“Foundry”). At the close of each day, the bitcoin we have\nearned is transferred by Foundry to our custodial wallet address at NYDIG. We abstain from engaging in the direct sale of our bitcoin on any exchange. Instead, we rely on\nNYDIG to handle the sale of our mined bitcoin in accordance with our execution agreement with NYDIG, as detailed further in the “Risk Factors” section herein. Our bitcoin\nsales occur on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nBitcoin and Blockchain\nBitcoin, introduced in 2008, fundamentally transformed the landscape of digital currency by providing a decentralized mechanism for exchanging and preserving\nvalue. It operates on a consensus-based network, utilizing a public ledger termed as the “blockchain” to meticulously record every bitcoin transaction. TeraWulf’s fully\nintegrated bitcoin mining facilities capitalize on zero-carbon energy sources, primarily sourced from baseload nuclear and hydroelectric power.\nBitcoin mining involves validating transactions through a proof-of-work consensus method, where miners solve complex mathematical problems to add transactions to\nthe blockchain. TeraWulf invests in computation networks (mining rigs) equipped with application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) chips and secures power to validate\ntransactions and maintain the bitcoin ledger. Factors such as computing capacity, electricity costs, and location play pivotal roles in mining operations.\nOur Facilities\nTeraWulf currently conducts its bitcoin mining operations at two established data centers: the Lake Mariner facility in upstate New York (the “Lake Mariner Facility”)\nand the jointly owned Nautilus facility located in central\n29\nTable of Contents\nPennsylvania (the “Nautilus Cryptomine Facility”). As of December 31, 2023, 95% of TeraWulf’s mining operations were fueled by zero-carbon energy, reflecting our\ndedication to sustainability. The Company’s ongoing objective is to achieve complete reliance on zero-carbon energy sources.\nAs of December 31, 2023, these two industrial scale projects had a combined operating capacity of 5.5 EH/s with approximately 48,900 miners deployed, comprised of\n33,100 operational miners at the Lake Mariner Facility (including 4,800 hosted miners) and 15,800 self-miners at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. As of the date of this\nAnnual Report, the Company has a total operational capacity of 210 megawatts (“MW”) and is currently constructing an additional 35 MW at its Lake Mariner Facility, which\nis expected to be operational in mid-2024.\nLake Mariner Facility\nLocated at a site adjacent to the now decommissioned coal-fired power plant in Barker, New York, the Lake Mariner Facility began sustainably mining bitcoin in\nMarch 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Lake Mariner Facility was operating approximately 115 megawatt (“MW”) of bitcoin mining capacity and as of the date of this\nAnnual Report, the Company has expanded its Lake Mariner Facility infrastructure to 160 MW of bitcoin mining capacity at the site. The Company has an agreement in place\nwith the Power Authority of the State of New York (“NYPA”) for 90 MW of high load factor power to support its bitcoin mining operations (the “PPA”). The PPA was\nexecuted on February 12, 2022 and has a term of ten years from the date of commencement of NYPA’s power delivery. The Lake Mariner Facility is situated on an expansive\nsite on the shores of Lake Ontario and has the ability to scale up to 500 MW of capacity.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned approximately 30,100 miners, exclusive of the 4,800 hosted miners, of which approximately 28,300 are operational at the Lake\nMariner Facility with the remainder undergoing maintenance or on standby to replace miners under repair. These miners were comprised as follows:\nVendor and Model Number of miners\nBitmain S19 Pro 6,700\nBitmain S19 XP 6,300\nBitmain S19j Pro 11,800\nMinerVA M7 4,100\nWhatsminer M30S+ 1,200\n30,100\nAs of December 31, 2023, our fleet of miners ranged in age from 0.4 to 1.6 years and have an average age of approximately 0.8 years. We do not have scheduled\ndowntime for our miners; however, while we periodically perform unscheduled maintenance on our miners, such downtime has not been significant historically. When\nperforming unscheduled maintenance, depending on the length of estimated repair time, we may replace a miner with a substitute miner to limit overall downtime. Our fleet of\nminers at the Lake Mariner Facility had a range of energy efficiency from 22.0 to 39.0 joules per terahash (“j/th”) and has an average energy efficiency of 28.8 j/th.\nNautilus Cryptomine Facility\nLocated in Berwick, Pennsylvania, Nautilus Cryptomine LLC (“Nautilus”) is a joint venture between TeraWulf and a subsidiary of Talen Energy Corporation\n(“Talen”). Nautilus currently owns a 200 MW bitcoin mining facility located adjacent to the 2.5 gigawatt nuclear-powered Susquehanna Station. The Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility represents the first bitcoin mining facility site that is powered by 100% “behind the meter” zero-carbon nuclear energy, which is contracted at a fixed rate of 2.0 cents\nper kilowatt-hour for a term of five years with two successive three-year renewal options. Under the Nautilus joint venture agreement, the Company holds a 25% equity interest\nin Nautilus and Talen holds a 75% equity interest, each subject to adjustment based on relative capital contributions. TeraWulf began mining bitcoin at the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility in the first quarter of 2023 and, as of December 31, 2023, had 50 MW of operational bitcoin mining capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. On February 28,\n2024, the Company exercised its option to increase its energy requirement at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility by an incremental 50 MW (for a total of 100 MW attributable to\nTeraWulf).\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 48,000 miners have been deployed at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility of which 46,000 are operational with the remainder\nundergoing maintenance or on standby to replace miners under repair.\n30\nTable of Contents\nApproximately 15,800 of the deployed miners are attributed to TeraWulf's contributions to Nautilus in order to utilize TeraWulf's allotted 50 MW of bitcoin mining capacity.\nThese miners are comprised as follows:\nVendor and Model Number of miners\nBitmain S19 Pro 6,300\nBitmain S19 XP 7,100\nBitmain S19j Pro 2,400\n15,800\nAs of December 31, 2023, these miners ranged in age from 0.7 to 0.8 years and have an average age of approximately 0.8 years. Nautilus does not have scheduled\ndowntime for miners; however, while Nautilus periodically performs unscheduled maintenance on miners, such downtime has not been significant historically. When\nperforming unscheduled maintenance, depending on the length of estimated repair time, Nautilus may replace a miner with a substitute miner to limit overall downtime. These\nminers have a range of energy efficiency from 22.0 to 30.0 j/th and an average energy efficiency of 25.5 j/th. While the Company holds a 25% equity interest in Nautilus, the\ndistributions of mined bitcoin are determined by each of TeraWulf’s and Talen’s respective hashrate contributions. Accordingly, the Company has contributed approximately\n1.9 EH/s of a total 5.2 EH/s of miners which results in an approximate 35.7% of the hashrate share attributed to the Company.\nCombined Facilities\nAs described above, there are a variety of factors that influence our ability to mine bitcoin profitably, including bitcoin’s value in USD, mining difficulty global\nhashrate, power prices, fleet energy efficiency, data center energy efficiency and other factors. The energy efficiency of a mining fleet drives profitability, because the most\nsignificant direct expense for bitcoin mining is power. We believe we operate a highly efficient fleet of miners. The Company uses the following metrics as indicators of\noperational progress and effectiveness and believes they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to provide comparisons to peer companies.\nThe table below presents our miner efficiency and computing power as compared to the global computing power as of December 31, 2023.\nCombined facilities(1) As of December 31, 2023\nGlobal hashrate (EH/s)(2) 558.4\nMiner efficiency (w/th)(3) 27.6\nTeraWulf combined average operating hashrate (EH/s)(4) 5.0\nTeraWulf % of Global hashrate 0.9 %\n(1) Results reflect hashrate of mining operations at the Lake Mariner Facility and TeraWulf’s net share of hashrate produced at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.\n(2) Total global hashrate obtained from YCHARTS (https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate)\n(3) Joules of energy required to produce each terahash of processing power\n(4) While nameplate inventory for TeraWulf’s two facilities is 5.5 EH/s, inclusive of gross total hosted miners, actual monthly hashrate performance depends on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to)\nperformance tuning to increase efficiency and maximize margin, scheduled outages (scopes to improve reliability or performance), unscheduled outages, curtailment due to participation in various cash\ngenerating demand response programs, derate of ASICS due to adverse weather and ASIC maintenance and repair.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our operating hashrate was approximately 0.9% of the total global hashrate, and we received approximately the same percentage of the\nglobal blockchain rewards, which as of that date, equaled approximately 10 to 11 bitcoin per day. Ultimately, in order to mine profitably, we work to ensure that these mining\nrewards cover our direct operating costs.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents the average cost of mining each bitcoin, including bitcoin mined at the Lake Mariner Facility and the Company’s net share of bitcoin mined\nat the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the total energy cost per kWh utilized within the facilities.\nYear Ended December 31,\nCost of mining - Analysis of costs to mine one bitcoin 2023\nCost of mining - Lake Mariner Facility and net share of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility\nCost of energy per bitcoin mined $ 8,676\nOther direct costs of mining - non energy utilities per bitcoin mined $ 29\nCost to mine one bitcoin $ 8,705\nValue of each bitcoin mined(1) $ 29,645\nCost to mine one bitcoin as % of value of bitcoin mined 29.4 %\nStatistics\nLake Mariner Facility and net share of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility\nTotal bitcoin mined(2) 3,343\nTotal value of bitcoin mined(1) ($ in thousands) $ 99,105\nTotal kWhs utilized 910,743,637\nTotal energy expense, net of expected demand response proceeds(3) ($ in thousands) $ 29,006\nCost per kWh $ 0.032\nEnergy expense, net as % of value of bitcoin mined 29.3 %\nOther direct costs of mining ($ in thousands) $ 97\n1 Computed as the weighted-average opening price of bitcoin on each respective day the mined bitcoin is earned. Excludes bitcoin earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired in\nFebruary 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility.\n2 Excludes bitcoin earned from profit sharing associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility of 51 bitcoin for the year ended December 31, 2023, and includes\nTeraWulf’s net share of bitcoin mined at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, based on the hashrate share attributed to the Company.\n3 Excludes energy expenses associated with a hosting agreement that expired in February 2024 at the Lake Mariner Facility and includes TeraWulf’s net share of energy expense at the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility, based on aggregate nameplate power consumption of deployed miners attributed to TeraWulf’s contribution to Nautilus.\nPower prices are the most significant cost driver for our bitcoin mining operations, and energy expense represented 29.3% as expressed as a percentage of value of\nbitcoin mined during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nEnergy prices can be highly volatile and global events (including the war in Ukraine and the resulting natural gas shortage) have caused power prices to increase\nnationwide over the past year. Our wholly-owned Lake Mariner Facility in New York is subject to variable prices and market rate fluctuations with respect to wholesale power\ncosts. Such prices are governed by market power prices and said prices can change hour to hour. While this renders energy prices less predictable, it also gives us greater ability\nand flexibility to actively manage the energy we consume with an eye towards increasing profitability and energy efficiency. Energy prices are also highly sensitive to weather\nevents, such as winter storms and polar vortices, which increase the demand for power regionally. When such events occur, we may curtail our operations to avoid using power\nat increased rates or we may be curtailed under demand response programs in which we participate. The average aggregate power prices incurred at the Lake Mariner Facility\nand the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.032 per kilowatt hour.\nThe management team makes real-time determinations on the need and timing during which we should curtail. If not otherwise curtailed under demand response\nprograms, we curtail when power prices exceed the value we would receive for the corresponding fixed bitcoin reward. This means if bitcoin’s value decreases or energy prices\nincrease, our curtailment will increase; likewise, when bitcoin’s value increases and energy prices decrease, our curtailment will decrease. The management team manages this\ndecision on an hour-by-hour basis.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company curtailed operations at the Lake Mariner Facility due to weather events, energy price spikes, and demand\nresponse program participation. The Company records expected payments to be received for demand response programs as a reduction in cost of revenue, which amounted to\n$3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has purchased all miners with cash and has not used limited recourse equipment financing to complete its miner purchases. The Company has raised\ncapital through both the issuance of equity and corporate level debt. These funds have been utilized to support operations, invest in our joint ventures, purchase miners and other\nfixed assets. Costs related to such issuances are not included in this analysis. Additionally, miner acquisition costs, or capital expenditures, are not factored into the above cost of\nmining analysis as capital expenditures do not impact the marginal cost of production of one bitcoin. Miner acquisition costs, or capital expenditures, are recorded at cost in\nproperty, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the equipment: generally 4 years for miners and 5 years for computer equipment. While we currently depreciate our miners over a 4-year period, given our\nhistorical low cost of power ($0.032 per kilowatt-hour for the year ended December 31, 2023), it is possible the average actual useful life of our miners may exceed the\ndepreciation period in certain circumstances. Nevertheless, if depreciation of our miner fleet were factored into the above cost of mining analysis, it would add $11,187 per\nbitcoin mined in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgement, including consideration of historical operating data, which is limited in the industrial-scale bitcoin\nmining space given the advent of next-generation mining rigs primarily used by the Company’s bitcoin mining operations. Depreciation periods can be adjusted periodically if\nan event, regulatory action, or change in retirement patterns indicates an update is necessary. Additionally, management considers expected future energy market prices and\nconditions, operating costs, maintenance practices and capital investment requirements in determining the estimated useful lives of our equipment and reassesses the\nreasonableness of estimated useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant. When a determination has been made that an asset will be retired or extended\nbefore or after the end of its current estimated useful life, depreciation provisions will be accelerated or extended to reflect the shortened or lengthened estimated useful life,\nwhich could have a material unfavorable or favorable impact on future results of operations.\nThe Business Combination\nTeraWulf completed its business combination with IKONICS Corporation (“IKONICS) on December 13, 2021 (the “Closing Date”) pursuant to which, among other\nthings, TeraCub Inc. (“TeraCub,” formerly known as TeraWulf Inc.) would effectively acquire IKONICS and become a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq, which was the\nprimary purpose of the business combination. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of IKONICS common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to\nthe Closing Date was automatically converted into and exchanged for (i) one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock of TeraWulf, (ii) one\ncontingent value right (“CVR”) pursuant to a Contingent Value Rights Agreement between TeraWulf and IKONICS (the “CVR Agreement”), and (iii) the right to receive $5.00\nin cash, without interest. TeraCub common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date was automatically converted into the right to receive a number\nof validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of TeraWulf such that the TeraCub common stockholders prior to conversion would effectively control 98% of the total\noutstanding shares of TeraWulf immediately subsequent to the Closing Date.\nPursuant to the CVR Agreement, each shareholder of IKONICS as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, received one CVR for each outstanding share of common\nstock of IKONICS then held. The holders of the CVRs are entitled to receive 95% of the Net Proceeds (as defined in the CVR Agreement), if any, from the sale, transfer,\ndisposition, spin-off, or license of all or any part of the pre-merger business of IKONICS completed within 18 months following the date of the merger, subject to a reserve of up\nto 10% of the Gross Proceeds (as defined in the CVR Agreement) from such transaction and such other amount to be retained to satisfy Retained Liabilities, as defined. The\nCVRs do not confer to their holders any voting or equity or ownership interest in IKONICS or TeraWulf and are not transferable, except in limited circumstances, and are not\nlisted on any quotation system or traded on any securities exchange. The CVR Agreement will terminate after all payment obligations to the holders thereof have been satisfied.\nHolders of CVRs will not be eligible to receive payment for dispositions, if any, of any part of the pre-merger business of IKONICS after the eighteen-month anniversary of the\nClosing Date. As of December 31, 2022, the CVR liability included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet was $10.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022,\nthe Company completed sales of all IKONICS’ net assets held for sale for net proceeds of $13.2 million, of which $7.0 million remained in escrow under provisions of an asset\npurchase agreement as of December 31, 2022. Subsequent to the asset sales, IKONICS’ name was changed to RM 101 Inc. (“RM 101”) and the entity has no remaining\noperations or employees.\nIn February 2023, all escrowed funds were released to the Company and during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company made various CVR payments,\nincluding (i) a CVR payment of $3.9 million in February 2023 related to the quarterly calculation for the fourth quarter of 2022, (ii) a CVR payment of $5.7 million in May\n2023 related to the quarterly calculation for the first quarter of 2023, and (iii) the final CVR payment of $1.4 million in November 2023. In accordance with the CVR\nAgreement, as of December 31, 2023, all IKONICS’ net assets previously held for sale had been\n33\nTable of Contents\nsold and the Company has made all of the aggregate distributions of $11.0 million of proceeds to the CVR Holders such that the CVR Agreement was deemed terminated as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nUpon the consummation of the business combination, RM 101 common stock ceased trading on the Nasdaq and TeraWulf Common Stock began trading on the\nNasdaq on December 14, 2021 under the ticker symbol “WULF.”\nResults of Operations\nThe Company generates revenue in the form of bitcoin by providing hash computation services to a mining pool operator to mine bitcoin and validate transactions on\nthe global Bitcoin Network using application-specific integrated circuit computers owned by the Company. The earned bitcoin are routinely sold for U.S. dollars. The Company\nalso earns revenue by providing miner hosting services to third parties. In 2023, the Company established WULF Compute as its internal innovation center, with a specific\nfocus on the research, development, and deployment of its expansive and scalable digital infrastructure. Subsequent to a successful pilot phase involving a compact graphics\nprocessing unit (“GPU”) system designed to bolster generative AI and large language model applications, the Company made an initial commitment by allocating a 2 MW\npower block at the Lake Mariner Facility located in upstate New York (the “Lake Mariner Facility”). This allocation is intended to support a broader high-performance\ncomputing (“HPC”) initiative, strategically aimed at diversifying the Company’s revenue streams. While the Company may choose to mine other digital currencies or pursue\nother data center services in the future, it has no plans to do so currently. The Company's plan of operation for the next twelve months is to continue to increase the mining\ncapacity at its operating mining facilities and to complete the construction of the fourth building at its Lake Mariner Facility.\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nThe following table presents revenue and cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue $ 69,229 $ 15,033\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) $ 27,315 $ 11,083\nRevenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $69.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively, an increase of $54.2 million. The increase was due\nprimarily to the increase in mining and hosting capacity due to infrastructure constructed and placed in service in the latter half of the year ended December 31, 2022 and during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. The Company began mining bitcoin at the Lake Mariner Facility in March 2022 and as of December 31, 2023, the Company had energized\ntwo buildings and additional infrastructure comprising 115 MW of capacity. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, revenue from mining was $61.7 million and\n$10.5 million, respectively, and revenue from hosting was $7.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively.\nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $27.3 million and $11.1 million, respectively, an increase of\napproximately $16.2 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in mining and hosting capacity due to infrastructure constructed and placed in service between\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 at the Lake Mariner Facility. Cost of revenues is comprised primarily of power expense and, to a lesser degree, the cost of services\nprovided under our miner hosting agreements. The Company records proceeds related to participation in demand response programs as a reduction in cost of revenue in the\nperiod corresponding to the underlying demand response program period; the amount of aggregate proceeds received or expected to be received were $3.5 million and $0.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company is actively expanding its enrollment in such available programs in New York.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCosts and Expenses\nThe following table presents operating expenses (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating expenses $ 2,116 $ 2,038\nOperating expenses - related party 2,773 1,248\n$ 4,889 $ 3,286\nOperating expenses (including related party expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $4.9 million and $3.3 million,\nrespectively, a net increase of $1.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, operating expenses increased slightly due to increases in repair costs and property\ninsurance offset by lower equipment lease expense as compared to the prior year, while operating expenses – related party, which is paid to a related party which provides\nservices to its Lake Mariner Facility, increased due to increased staffing at the Lake Mariner Facility related to infrastructure constructed and placed in service between\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023 and additionally, to a lesser degree, by an increase in ground lease expense.\nThe following table presents selling, general and administrative expenses (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 23,693 $ 22,770\nSelling, general and administrative expenses - related party 13,325 13,280\n$ 37,018 $ 36,050\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (including related party expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $37.0 million and $36.1 million,\nrespectively, a net increase of $1.0 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of professional fees, legal fees, employee compensation and\nbenefits, stock-based compensation to employees and consultants, insurance and general corporate expenses. The increases during the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to the prior year were primarily due to increased expenses of (i) stock-based compensation of $4.3 million, (ii) employee compensation and benefits of $3.3 million,\nand (iii) related party expense to be settled with respect to common stock of $0.8 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in legal fees of $3.7 million,\ninsurance expense of $1.9 million, and professional fees of $1.7 million. As previously disclosed, the Company has undertaken cost reduction initiatives targeted at reducing its\noverall selling, general and administrative expenses that are expected to benefit its operating profitability going forward.\nDepreciation for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $28.4 million and $6.7 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the increase in\nmining capacity due to infrastructure constructed and placed in service between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 at the Lake Mariner Facility.\nImpairment of digital currency for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Impairment of digital currency\nrepresents the decline in bitcoin prices during the Company’s holding period of its bitcoin. Bitcoin impairment is not reversed during its holding period but instead a gain, if\nany, is recognized upon its liquidation. Realized gain on sale of digital currency, representing such gains on bitcoin liquidation, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nwas $3.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively. In each case, the increase was due to increased bitcoin both earned and sold due to the increase in mining capacity between\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment of $1.2 million related to disposals of miners\nand write-off of deposits on miners. No loss on disposal of property, plant, and equipment was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss on nonmonetary miner exchange of $0.8 million related to an exchange agreement with\nNautilus. No loss on nonmonetary miner exchange was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n35\nTable of Contents\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $34.8 million and $24.7 million, respectively, an increase of $10.1 million. Interest expense\nrelates primarily to the Company’s term loan financing in the principal amount of $139.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and $146.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The\nincrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase of approximately $10.2 million of\namortization of debt discount related to the term loan financing and an increase in related to the stated interest rate, which remained unchanged, on the term loan financing. The\nCompany’s term loan financing has a maturity date of December 1, 2024.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million related to an October 2022 amendment to a\nconvertible promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) which was considered an extinguishment of debt under GAAP due the change in fair value of the embedded conversion\nfeature of $1.6 million and the excess of the fair value of the amended Promissory Note of $9.4 million over the carrying value of the Promissory Note immediately prior to the\nmodification.\nIncome tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0 and $0.3 million, respectively. The decrease was do to, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company sold the net assets held for sale of IKONICS, resulting in reversal of existing net deferred tax liabilities and a related tax benefit of $0.3\nmillion recorded in income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations. Based upon the level of historical U.S. losses and future projections over the period in which\nthe net deferred tax assets are deductible, at this time, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the remaining deductible\ntemporary differences, and as a result the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nEquity in net loss of investee, net of tax\nEquity in net loss of investee, net of tax for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $9.3 million and $15.7 million, respectively. The amounts include an\nimpairment loss of $13.6 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the distribution of miners from Nautilus to the\nCompany whereby the miners were marked to fair value from book value on the date distributed. The impairment loss was the result of decreasing prices for miners between\ninitial purchase and distribution. In each case, the remaining amounts represent TeraWulf’s proportional share of income or losses of Nautilus, which commenced principal\noperations in February 2023.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nAll items included in loss from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 relate to its wholly-\nowned operations of its sole business segment, digital currency mining, due to the Company presenting the RM 101 business as discontinued operations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The decrease was due\nto, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the loss from discontinued operations reporting being comprised primarily of an impairment loss on discontinued operations of $4.5\nmillion to write down the related carrying amounts of IKONICS’ net assets to their fair values less estimated cost to sell, offset by a remeasurement gain of $1.1 million on the\nCVRs, which represents the contingent consideration purchase price component of the RM 101 acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2023, all assets of IKONICS had\nbeen sold prior to the start of the period and RM 101 had no operations or employees.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nTo provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the\nUnited States (“GAAP”), we disclose Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and it should\nnot be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures reported by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) impacts of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (ii) preferred stock\ndividends, stock-based compensation expense and related party expense to be settled with respect to common stock, all of which are non-cash items that the Company believes\nare not reflective of its general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in\ncomparison to other companies; (iii) equity in net loss of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus; (iv) costs related to non-routine regulatory activities, which costs management\ndoes not believe are\n36\nTable of Contents\nreflective of the Company’s ongoing operating activities; (v) other income which is related to interest income or income for which management believes is not reflective of the\nCompany’s ongoing operating activities; and (vi) gains and losses related to discontinued operations that are not be applicable to the Company’s future business activities. The\nCompany’s Adjusted EBITDA also includes the impact of distributions from investee received in bitcoin related to a return on the Nautilus investment, which management\nbelieves, in conjunction with excluding the impact of equity in net loss of investee, net of tax, is reflective of assets available for the Company’s use in its ongoing operations as\na result of its investment in Nautilus.\nManagement believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and\nthose of other companies, and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating\nresults over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to\ninvestors and analysts in comparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the foregoing to be the case even though\nsome of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management does not believe any of such items are normal operating\nexpenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related revenues). For example, the Company expects that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from\nAdjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees,\nofficers, directors and consultants. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary to generate the Company’s bitcoin related\nrevenue.\nThe Company’s Adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other\ncompanies in the Company’s industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance\nunder GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating (loss) income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Although\nmanagement utilizes internally and presents Adjusted EBITDA, the Company only utilizes that measure supplementally and does not consider it to be a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation of, and should be read in\nconjunction with, the information contained in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure (i.e., net loss attributable to common\nstockholders) for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (74,495) $ (91,574)\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss attributable to common stockholders to non-GAAP adjusted\nEBITDA:\nPreferred stock dividends 1,074 783\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax 129 4,857\nEquity in net (income) loss of investee, net of tax, related to Nautilus 9,290 15,712\nDistributions from investee, related to Nautilus 21,949 —\nIncome tax expense (benefit) — (256)\nInterest expense 34,812 24,679\nDepreciation 28,350 6,667\nAmortization of right-of-use asset 1,001 303\nStock-based compensation expense 5,859 1,568\nRelated party expense to be settled with respect to common stock 2,917 2,083\nCosts related to non-routine regulatory activities — 996\nOther income (231) —\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA $ 30,655 $ (34,182)\n37\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had balances of cash and cash equivalents of $54.4 million, a working capital deficiency of $92.1 million, total stockholders’\nequity of $222.5 million and an accumulated deficit of $259.9 million. The Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $74.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The Company began mining bitcoin in March 2022 and had 5.5 EH/s of operating capacity across the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility as of December 31, 2023, which increased to 7.9 EH/s upon energization of the third building at the Lake Mariner Facility during the first quarter of 2024. To date, the\nCompany has relied primarily on proceeds from its issuances of debt and equity and sale of bitcoin, both self-mined and distributed from the joint venture which owns the\nNautilus Cryptomine Facility (see Note 11), to fund its principal operations. TeraWulf expects to fund its business operations and incremental infrastructure buildout primarily\nthrough positive cash flows from operations, including sales of bitcoin, both self-mined and distributed from the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility (see\nNote 11), cash on the balance sheet and the issuance of equity securities.\nThe principal uses of cash are for the operation and buildout of mining facilities, debt service, and general corporate activities and, to a lesser extent, investments in the\nNautilus joint venture related to mining facility buildout and general corporate activities. Cash flow information is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities:\nContinuing operations $ 4,160 $ (32,262)\nDiscontinued operations 103 (1,804)\nTotal operating activities 4,263 (34,066)\nInvesting activities (78,013) (94,047)\nFinancing activities 119,866 89,981\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 46,116 $ (38,132)\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities for continuing operations was $4.2 million and $(32.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.

The noncash expenses\nwere primarily comprised of (i) $19.5 million related to amortization of debt issuance cost, commitment fees and accretion of debt discount, (ii) $2.9 million of related party\nexpense to be settled with respect to common stock, (iii) $5.9 million related to stock-based compensation, (iv) $28.4 million of depreciation, (v) $1.0 million of amortization of\nright-of-use asset, (vi) $0.1 million related to realized gain on sale of digital currency net of impairment of digital currency, and (vii) $9.3 million related to the Company’s\nequity in net loss of investee, net of tax. The changes in certain assets and liabilities were primarily comprised of a net decrease in current liabilities (which includes accounts\npayable, other accrued liabilities and other amounts due to related parties) of $10.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operations results from a net\nloss of $90.8 million less (a) $35.6 million noncash expenses, net of $10.8 million increase in digital currency from mining, (b) proceeds from sale of bitcoin of $9.7 million,\nand (c) changes in certain asset and liability balances.

The changes in certain assets and liabilities were primarily comprised of a net increase in liabilities (which primarily includes accounts payable, other\naccrued liabilities, other amounts due to related parties) of $17.0 million, a net increase in current assets (which primarily includes prepaid expenses, amounts due from related\nparties and other current assets) of $2.8 million, an increase in other assets of $1.0 million.\n38\nTable of Contents\nCash used in investing activities was $78.0 million and 94.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company (i) invested $75.2 million and $61.1 million, respectively, in the buildout of mining facilities and (ii) invested $2.8 million and\n$46.2 million, respectively, in Nautilus related primarily to the joint venture’s miner deposits and mining facility buildout (including reimbursable payments made on behalf of\nthe joint venture of joint venture partner offset by reimbursement from joint venture or joint venture partner of less than $0.1 million net cash used). Additionally, during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 the Company received net proceeds from the sale of IKONICS’ net assets held for sale of $13.3 million. See “Contractual Obligations and Other\nCommitments” for additional discussion on miner and Nautilus commitments.\nCash provided by financing activities was $119.9 million and $90.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The July 2023 Bitmain Agreement provides that the Company will receive 15,100 S19j XP miners from Bitmain Delaware, with an option to\nreceive an additional 3,400 miners, pursuant to certain payment timing conditions, for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2023 for a total purchase price of $75.4 million. The\nCompany is entitled to apply coupons equivalent to 30% of the total purchase price, resulting in an estimated effective purchase price of $53.4 million for 18,500 miners. In\nSeptember 2023, the Company entered into a binding letter of intent with Bitmain Development PTE. Ltd. (“Bitmain PTE”), for the purchase of at least 1,200 PH of Antminer\nS21 miners, pursuant to which the Company paid a security deposit of $1.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company elected not to purchase the\napplicable quantity of Antminer S21 miners, as allowed under the letter of intent, and the $1.2 million security deposit was credited to the Company's account with Bitmain PTE\nand applied to the July 2023 Bitmain Agreement.

As of December 31, 2023, the working capital deficiency included the then outstanding $139.4 million\nprincipal balance of the Company’s Term Loans (See Note 9) which matures on December 1, 2024. To date, the Company has relied primarily on proceeds from its issuances of\ndebt and equity and sale of bitcoin, both self-mined and distributed from the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility (see Note 11), to fund its principal\noperations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company accomplished several notable steps to achieve positive cash flows from operations and in the aggregate,\nnamely: (1) the Company amended its long-term debt agreement (see Note 9) to, among other changes, remove the fixed principal amortization through April 7, 2024 and,\nsubsequent to December 31, 2023, through maturity on December 1, 2024 (see Note 18), (2) the Company received net proceeds of $135.9 million through the issuance of\nshares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), $2.5 million from warrant issuances in conjunction with equity offerings (see Note 15), and\n$1.3 million from issuance of a\n39\nTable of Contents\nconvertible promissory note (see Note 10), (3) the Company commenced mining activities at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, deems that it has funded all known and expected\ncapital commitments at that facility, and received bitcoin distributions of $21.9 million from the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, (4) for the existing\noperations at the Lake Mariner Facility in buildings one and two and at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, the Company received substantially all contracted miners from the\nminer suppliers and has no remaining outstanding financial commitments under the miner purchase agreements (see Notes 11 and 12), and (5) the construction activities at the\nLake Mariner Facility for buildings one, two and three and at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility are substantially complete as of December 31, 2023, although the Company\nintends to continue to expand its infrastructure. Additionally, if a business need requires its use, the Company has an active at-the-market sales agreement for sale of shares of\nCommon Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 million (the “ATM Sales Agreement”), which had a remaining capacity of $81.2 million and $29.8 million\nas of December 31, 2023 and March 19, 2024, respectively. The issuance of Common Stock under this agreement would be made pursuant to the Company’s effective\nregistration statement on Form S-3 (Registration statement No. 333-262226).\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company is required to pay amounts under its long-term debt agreement subject to an excess cash flow sweep, as defined, on a quarterly\nbasis which automatically extends to the maturity of the Term Loans of December 1, 2024, in the event the Company repays at least $40.0 million of the principal balance of the\nTerm Loans by April 1, 2024 (see Note 9). In February 2024, the Company achieved aggregate repayment of $40.0 million of the principal balance of the Term Loans, thereby\nautomatically extending the excess cash flow sweep to December 1, 2024 (see Note 18). As of March 19, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans was $106.0\nmillion. The Company has determined, based on its expected range of forecasted bitcoin prices, network hashrate, and power prices, that it is probable that it will generate\npositive cash flows from operations and be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, including the Term Loans\nthrough maturity without the use of proceeds from equity offerings. Therefore, the Company determined there is not substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue\nas a going concern through at least the next twelve months. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from TeraWulf’s possible\ninability to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe above discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have\nbeen prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements\nrequires the application of accounting policies and the use of estimates. The accounting policies most important to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and\nestimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described below.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the Company’s significant\naccounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers (“ASC 606”). The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nMining Pool\nThe Company has entered into an arrangement with a cryptocurrency mining pool (the Foundry USA Pool) to perform hash computations (i.e. hashrate) for the mining\npool in exchange for consideration. Providing hash computation services to a mining pool is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of such hash\ncomputation services is the sole performance obligation. The mining pool arrangement is terminable at any time without substantial penalty by Foundry USA Pool and may be\nterminated without substantial penalty by the Company upon providing one Contract Day’s, as defined, prior written notice. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation\nonly begins when and continues while the Company provides hash computation services to its customer, the mining pool operator. Accordingly, the contract term with Foundry\nUSA Pool is deemed to be less than 24 hours and to continuously renew throughout the day. Additionally, the Company concluded that the mining pool operator’s (i.e., the\ncustomer’s) renewal right is not a material right because the renewal rights do not include any discounts; that is, the terms, conditions, and compensation amounts are at the\nthen-current market rates.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThere is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nThe mining pool applies the Full Pay Per Share (“FPPS”) payout model. Under the FPPS model, in exchange for providing hash computation services to the pool, the\nCompany is entitled to pay-per-share base amount and transaction fee reward compensation, calculated on a daily basis, at an amount that approximates the total bitcoin that\ncould have been mined and transaction fees that could have been awarded using the Company’s hash computation services, based upon the then current blockchain difficulty.\nUnder this model, the Company is entitled to compensation, payable in bitcoin, regardless of whether the pool operator successfully records a block to the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration and is all variable. Because digital currency is considered noncash consideration,\nfair value of the digital currency award received would generally be determined using the quoted price of the related digital currency in the Company’s principal market at the\ntime of contract inception. The Company has adopted an accounting policy to aggregate individual contracts with individual terms less than 24 hours within each intraday\nperiod and apply a consistent valuation point, the start of day Coordinated Universal Time (00:00:00 UTC), to value the related noncash consideration. Revenue is recognized\nwhen it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, which is the same day that control of the contracted service\ntransfers to the mining pool and is the same day as the contract inception. After every 24-hour contract term, the mining pool transfers the digital currency consideration to the\nCompany’s designated digital currency wallets.\nConsideration payable to the customer in the form of a pool operator fee, which is incurred only to the extent that the Company has generated FPPS consideration, is\ndeducted from the bitcoin the Company receives and is recorded as contra-revenue, as it does not represent a payment for a distinct good or service.\nData Center Hosting\nThe Company’s current hosting contracts are service contracts with a single performance obligation. The service the Company provides primarily includes hosting the\ncustomers’ miners in a physically secure data center with electrical power, internet connectivity, ambient air cooling and available maintenance resources. Hosting revenue is\nrecognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance. The Company recognizes hosting revenue to the extent\nthat a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur. Data center hosting customers are invoiced and payments are due on a monthly basis. While the majority of\nconsideration is paid in cash, certain consideration is payable in digital currency. Because digital currency is considered noncash consideration, fair value of the digital currency\naward received is determined using the quoted price of the related digital currency in the Company’s principal market at the time of contract inception. The Company has one\ndata center hosting contract with a customer, which expired in January 2024, for which the quoted price of bitcoin in the Company’s principal market at the time of contract\ninception was approximately $38,000. The Company recorded miner hosting revenue of $7.5 million and $4.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nDigital currency, net\nDigital currency, net is comprised of bitcoin earned as noncash consideration in exchange for providing hash computation services to a mining pool as well as in\nexchange for data center hosting services which are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition policy disclosed above. From time to time, the\nCompany also receives bitcoin as distributions-in-kind from its joint venture. Digital currency is included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets due to the\nCompany’s ability to sell it in a highly liquid marketplace and because the Company reasonably expects to liquidate its digital currency to support operations within the next\ntwelve months. The Company sells its digital currency on a first-in-first-out basis.\nDigital currency is accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for\nimpairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying\namount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that\nan impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes\notherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nThe Company has elected to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and to track its bitcoin activity daily for impairment assessment purposes. The\nCompany determines the fair value of its bitcoin on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on quoted prices on the active trading\nplatform that the Company normally transacts and has determined is its principal market for bitcoin (Level 1 inputs), based on all\n41\nTable of Contents\ninformation that is reasonably available. The Company performs an analysis each day to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the\nquoted price of bitcoin on the active trading platform, indicate that it is more likely than not that its bitcoin are impaired. For impairment testing purposes, the lowest intraday\ntrading price of bitcoin is identified at the single bitcoin level (one bitcoin). The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of bitcoin and the lowest daily trading price of bitcoin\nrepresents a recognized impairment loss. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of previously\nrecorded impairment losses is prohibited. The Company recognized impairment of digital currency of $3.0 million and $1.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\nDigital currency awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to cash used in operating activities on the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows. Proceeds from sales of digital currency are included within cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash\nflows and any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in costs and operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The receipt of digital currency\nas distributions-in-kind from equity investees are included within supplemental disclosure of noncash investing activities.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVariable interest entities (“VIE”) are legal entities in which equity investors do not have (i) sufficient equity at risk for the legal entity to finance its activities without\nadditional subordinated financial support, or (ii) as a group, the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact\nthe entity’s economic performance, or (iii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the legal entity. The\nCompany would consolidate any VIE in which it has a controlling financial interest through being deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of\na VIE has both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (2) the obligation\nto absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If both\ncharacteristics are met, the Company considers itself to be the primary beneficiary and therefore will consolidate that VIE into its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon initial involvement with a VIE and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a\nVIE on an ongoing basis. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based upon facts and circumstances\nfor the VIE and requires significant judgments such as whether the entity is a VIE, whether the Company’s interest in a VIE is a variable interest, the determination of the\nactivities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity, whether the Company controls those activities, and whether the Company has the obligation to\nabsorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.\nIn 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture, Nautilus Cryptomine LLC (“Nautilus”), with an unrelated co-venturer to develop, construct and operate up to 300\nMW of zero-carbon bitcoin mining in Pennsylvania (the “Joint Venture”). Due to the initial nature of the Joint Venture and the continued commitment for additional financing,\nthe Company determined Nautilus is a VIE. While the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over Nautilus, the Company has determined that it does not\nhave the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Nautilus. Initially, the power to direct the activities of Nautilus that most\nsignificantly impact Nautilus’ economic performance were shared equally by both parties within the Joint Venture due to the requirement for both equity holders to approve\nmany of the key operating decisions and when not equally shared, were predominantly under the control of the co-venturer, including through the co-venturer’s majority\nrepresentation on the board of managers. As such, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Nautilus and, therefore, has accounted for this entity\nunder the equity method of accounting. Risks associated with the Company’s involvement with Nautilus include a commitment to potentially fund additional equity\ninvestments. See Note 11 for additional information, including a decrease in the Company’s ownership interest in Nautilus during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an\nasset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Any impairment loss recorded is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets\nexceeds the fair value of the assets. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded no impairment charges for long-lived assets.\n42\nTable of Contents\nIssuance of Debt with Common Stock or Warrants; Debt Modification\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company entered into the LGSA, which consists of an original term loan facility of $123.5 million (the “Original Term Loan”). In\nconnection with the Original Term Loan, the Company issued to the holders of the Original Term Loan 839,398 shares of Common Stock, which is a quantity of Common\nStock representing 1.5% of the outstanding shares of the publicly registered shares of TeraWulf subsequent to the closing of the Original Term Loan. The allocation of proceeds\nbetween the debt instrument and any other components included in the debt issuance, including Common Stock, is generally based on the relative fair value allocation method.\nIn applying the relative fair value allocation method, the determination of the fair value of the Common Stock issued and the fair value of the Original Term Loan independent\nof the Common Stock issued requires significant judgment. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% change in the estimated fair value of the Original Term Loan component would\nresult in a $1.9 million change in the fair value allocated to each of the Original Term Loan and equity components.\nIn July 2022, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the LGSA, which included an additional borrowing of $15.0 million and the issuance of warrants to\npurchase 5,787,732 shares of Common Stock at $0.01 per share. The accounting for debt modifications is complex and requires significant judgment. Potential accounting\noutcomes include troubled debt restructuring accounting, extinguishment accounting or modification accounting, each with different implications for the consolidated financial\nstatements. The Company has determined that modification accounting is applicable. Additionally, debt modification accounting requires the determination of the fair value of\nthe warrants issued, which requires significant judgment. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% change in the estimated fair value of the warrants would result in a $0.3 million\nchange in the recorded value of the borrowing under the First Amendment.\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the LGSA, which included an additional borrowing of $7.5 million and the issuance of warrants to\npurchase 2,667,678 shares of Common Stock at $0.01 per share. The accounting for debt modifications is complex and requires significant judgment. Potential accounting\noutcomes include troubled debt restructuring accounting, extinguishment accounting or modification accounting, each with different implications for the consolidated financial\nstatements. The Company has determined that modification accounting is applicable. Additionally, debt modification accounting requires the determination of the fair value of\nthe warrants issued, which requires significant judgment. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% change in the estimated fair value of the warrants would result in a $0.2 million\nchange in the recorded value of the borrowing under the Third Amendment.\nIn March 2023, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the LGSA, which included the issuance of warrants to purchase 27,759,265 shares of Common\nStock at $0.01 per share and 13,879,630 shares of Common Stock at $1.00 per share. The accounting for debt modifications is complex and requires significant judgment.\nPotential accounting outcomes include troubled debt restructuring accounting, extinguishment accounting or modification accounting, each with different implications for the\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company has determined that modification accounting is applicable. Additionally, debt modification accounting requires the\ndetermination of the fair value of the warrants issued, which requires significant judgment. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% change in the estimated fair value of the warrants\nwould result in a $1.6 million change in the recorded value of the borrowing under the Fifth Amendment.\nConvertible Instruments\nThe Company accounts for its issuance of convertible debt and convertible equity instruments in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP. In connection with that\naccounting, the Company assesses the various terms and features of the agreement in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”), and ASC\n815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities (“ASC 815”). ASC 480 requires liability accounting for certain financial instruments, including shares that embody an unconditional\nobligation to transfer a variable number of shares, provided that the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on one of the following three\ncharacteristics: (1) a fixed monetary amount known at inception, (2) variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares or (3) variations in the fair\nvalue of the issuer’s equity shares, but the monetary value to the counterparty moves in the opposite direction as the value of the issuer’s shares. In accordance with ASC 815,\nthe Company assesses the various terms and features of the agreement to determine whether or not they contain embedded derivative instruments that are required under ASC\n815 to be accounted for separately from the host contract and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of derivative liabilities, if any, is required to be revalued\nat each reporting date, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in the current period’s operating results. The Company did not have any liabilities required to be\nrevalued in accordance with ASC 480 or ASC 815 as of December 31, 2023.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires, among other things, an\nasset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net\ndeferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provision of ASC 740\nrelated to accounting for uncertain income tax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is more likely than not that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by\nthe taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In\naccordance with the guidance of ASC 740, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence,\nmanagement believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax\npositions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured\nbased on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated\nwith the tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets\nalong with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The most critical estimate for income taxes is the\ndetermination of whether to record a valuation allowance for any net deferred tax asset, including net loss carryforwards, whereby management must estimate whether it is more\nlikely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized.\nITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Indicators of Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment when\nindicators of impairment are present that indicate the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.\nThe Company has long-lived assets which include property, plant and equipment, net of $205.3 million and operating lease right-of-use assets of $10.9 million as of December\n31, 2023. We identified the evaluation of indicators of impairment of long-lived assets as a critical audit matter given the significant judgments management utilizes in\nidentifying whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived asset carrying amounts may not be recoverable, such as the determination of the break-even\npoint of bitcoin prices on the Company’s operating model.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION\nOrganization\nTeraWulf Inc. (“TeraWulf” or the “Company”) is a digital asset technology company with a core business of digital infrastructure and energy development to enable sustainable\nbitcoin mining. TeraWulf’s principal business consists of developing and operating bitcoin mining facilities in the United States that are fueled by clean, low cost and reliable\npower sources. The Company generates revenue in the form of bitcoin by providing hash computation services to a mining pool operator to mine bitcoin and validate\ntransactions on the global bitcoin network using application-specific integrated circuit computers (“ASIC” or “miners”) owned by the Company. The earned bitcoin are routinely\nsold for U.S. dollars. The Company also earns revenue by providing miner hosting services to third parties. In 2023, the Company established WULF Compute as its internal\ninnovation center, with a specific focus on the research, development, and deployment of its expansive and scalable digital infrastructure. Subsequent to a successful pilot phase\ninvolving a compact graphics processing unit (“GPU”) system designed to bolster generative AI and large language model applications, the Company made an initial\ncommitment by allocating a 2 MW power block at the Lake Mariner Facility located in upstate New York (the “Lake Mariner Facility”). This allocation is intended to support a\nbroader high-performance computing (“HPC”) initiative, strategically aimed at diversifying the Company’s revenue streams. While the Company may choose to mine other\ndigital currencies or pursue other data center services in the future, it has no plans to do so currently.\nTeraWulf currently owns and operates, either independently or through a joint venture, two bitcoin mining facilities: the Lake Mariner Facility; and the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility located in central Pennsylvania (the “Nautilus Cryptomine Facility”). The Company’s wholly-owned Lake Mariner Facility began mining bitcoin in March 2022 and as\nof December 31, 2023, the Company had energized two buildings and additional infrastructure comprising 115 MW of capacity. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, Company\nenergized a third building which houses an incremental 45 MW of capacity, bringing the operational infrastructure capacity at the Lake Mariner Facility to approximately1 60\nMW. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, which has been developed and constructed through a joint venture (see Note 11), commenced mining operations in February 2023 and,\nin April 2023, achieved full energization of the Company’s allotted infrastructure capacity of 50 MW.\nOn December 13, 2021, TeraWulf Inc. completed a strategic business combination (the “Merger”) with IKONICS Corporation (“IKONICS”) , a Minnesota corporation,\npursuant to which, among other things, the Company effectively acquired IKONICS and became a publicly traded company on the National Association of Securities Dealers\nAutomated Quotations (“Nasdaq”), which was the primary purpose of the business combination. TeraWulf initially classified the IKONICS business as held for sale and\ndiscontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed sales of substantially all of IKONICS’\nhistorical net assets (see Note 3). Subsequent to the asset sales, IKONICS’ name was changed to RM 101 Inc. (“RM 101”).\nRisks and Uncertainties\nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nThe Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $74.5 million and generated cash flows from continuing operations of $4.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had balances of cash and cash equivalents of $54.4 million, a working capital deficiency of $92.1 million, total\nstockholders’ equity of $222.5 million and an accumulated deficit of $259.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, the working capital deficiency included the then outstanding\n$139.4 million principal balance of the Company’s Term Loans (See Note 9) which matures on December 1, 2024. The Company had5 .5 EH/s of operating capacity across the\nLake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility as of December 31, 2023 which increased to 7.9 EH/s upon energization of the third building at the Lake Mariner\nFacility during the first quarter of 2024. To date, the Company has relied primarily on proceeds from its issuances of debt and equity and sale of bitcoin, both self-mined and\ndistributed from the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility (see Note 11), to fund its principal operations.\nIn accordance with development of its bitcoin mining facilities, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company invested approximately $75.2 million for purchases of\nand deposits on plant and equipment as well as $2.8 million in its joint venture. TeraWulf expects to fund its business operations and incremental infrastructure buildout\nprimarily through\n52\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\npositive cash flows from operations, including sales of bitcoin, both self-mined and distributed from the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, cash on the\nbalance sheet and the issuance of equity securities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company accomplished several notable steps to achieve positive cash flows from operations and in the aggregate, namely: (1)\nthe Company amended its long-term debt agreement (see Note 9) to, among other changes, remove the fixed principal amortization through April 7, 2024 and, subsequent to\nDecember 31, 2023, through maturity on December 1, 2024 (see Note 18), (2) the Company received net proceeds of $135.9 million through the issuance of shares of our\ncommon stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), $2.5 million from warrant issuances in conjunction with equity offerings (see Note 15), and $1.3 million\nfrom issuance of a convertible promissory note (see Note 10), (3) the Company commenced mining activities at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, deems that it has funded all\nknown and expected capital commitments at that facility, and received bitcoin distributions of $21.9 million from the joint venture which owns the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility, (4) for the existing operations at the Lake Mariner Facility in buildings one and two and at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, the Company received substantially all\ncontracted miners from the miner suppliers and has no remaining outstanding financial commitments under the miner purchase agreements (see Notes 11 and 12), and (5) the\nconstruction activities at the Lake Mariner Facility for buildings one, two and three and at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility are substantially complete as of December 31, 2023,\nalthough the Company intends to continue to expand its infrastructure. Additionally, if a business need requires its use, the Company has an active at-the-market sales\nagreement for sale of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 million (the “ATM Sales Agreement”), which had a remaining capacity of\n$81.2 million and $29.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and March 19, 2024, respectively. The issuance of Common Stock under this agreement would be made pursuant to\nthe Company’s effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration statement No. 333-262226). As of December 31, 2023, the Company is required to pay amounts\nunder its long-term debt agreement subject to an excess cash flow sweep, as defined, on a quarterly basis which automatically extends to the maturity of the Term Loans of\nDecember 1, 2024, in the event the Company repays at least $40.0 million of the principal balance of the Term Loans by April 1, 2024 (see Note 9). In February 2024, the\nCompany achieved aggregate repayment of $40.0 million of the principal balance of the Term Loans, thereby automatically extending the excess cash flow sweep to\nDecember 1, 2024 (see Note 18). As of March 19, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans was $106.0 million. The Company has determined, based on its\nexpected range of forecasted bitcoin prices, network hashrate, and power prices, that it is probable that it will generate positive cash flows from operations and be able to realize\nits assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, including the Term Loans through maturity without the use of proceeds from equity\nofferings. Therefore, the Company determined there is not substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through at least the next twelve months.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from TeraWulf’s possible inability to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.\nGAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nEstimates are used for (but are not limited to) such items as the fair value of contingent consideration issued in a business combination, the establishment of useful lives for\nproperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets, the impairment of held for sale assets, the fair value of equity securities or warrants to purchase common stock issued\nindividually or as a component of a debt or equity offering, the fair value of changes to the conversion terms of embedded conversion features, the fair value and requisite\nservice periods of stock-based compensation, the fair value of assets received in nonmonetary transactions, the establishment of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that arise\nfrom leasing arrangements, the timing of commencement of capitalization for plant and equipment, impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment of long-lived\nassets, recoverability of deferred tax assets, amortization of deferred issuance costs and debt discount, and the recording of various accruals. These estimates are made after\nconsidering past and current events and assumptions about future events. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n53\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers (“ASC 606”). The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied\nto achieve that core principle:\n• Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer\n• Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n• Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n• Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n• Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised\ngood or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct” good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following\ncriteria are met: the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or\nservice is capable of being distinct), and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the\npromise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). If a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised\ngoods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The\nconsideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the\neffects of all of the following:\n• Variable consideration\n• Constraining estimates of variable consideration\n• The existence of a significant financing component in the contract\n• Noncash consideration\n• Consideration payable to a customer\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not\noccur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative\nstandalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or\nover time as appropriate.\nMining Pool\nThe Company has entered into an arrangement with a cryptocurrency mining pool (the Foundry USA Pool) to perform hash computations (i.e. hashrate) for the mining pool in\nexchange for consideration. Providing hash computation services to a mining pool is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of such hash computation\nservices is the sole performance obligation. The mining pool arrangement is terminable at any time without substantial penalty by Foundry USA Pool and may be terminated\nwithout substantial penalty by the Company upon providing one Contract Day’s, as defined, prior written notice. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation only begins\nwhen and continues while the Company provides hash computation services to its customer, the mining pool operator. Accordingly, the\n54\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncontract term with Foundry USA Pool is deemed to be less than 24 hours and to continuously renew throughout the day. Additionally, the Company concluded that the mining\npool operator’s (i.e., the customer’s) renewal right is not a material right because the renewal rights do not include any discounts; that is, the terms, conditions, and\ncompensation amounts are at the then-current market rates.\nThere is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nThe mining pool applies the Full Pay Per Share (“FPPS”) payout model. Under the FPPS model, in exchange for providing hash computation services to the pool, the Company\nis entitled to pay-per-share base amount and transaction fee reward compensation, calculated on a daily basis, at an amount that approximates the total bitcoin that could have\nbeen mined and transaction fees that could have been awarded using the Company’s hash computation services, based upon the then current blockchain difficulty. Under this\nmodel, the Company is entitled to compensation, payable in bitcoin, regardless of whether the pool operator successfully records a block to the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration and is all variable. Because digital currency is considered noncash consideration, fair value\nof the digital currency award received would generally be determined using the quoted price of the related digital currency in the Company’s principal market at the time of\ncontract inception. The Company has adopted an accounting policy to aggregate individual contracts with individual terms less than 24 hours within each intraday period and\napply a consistent valuation point, the start of day Coordinated Universal Time (00:00:00 UTC), to value the related noncash consideration. Revenue is recognized when it is\nprobable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, which is the same day that control of the contracted service transfers to the\nmining pool and is the same day as the contract inception. After every 24-hour contract term, the mining pool transfers the digital currency consideration to the Company’s\ndesignated digital currency wallets.\nConsideration payable to the customer in the form of a pool operator fee, which is incurred only to the extent that the Company has generated FPPS consideration, is deducted\nfrom the bitcoin the Company receives and is recorded as contra-revenue, as it does not represent a payment for a distinct good or service.\nData Center Hosting\nThe Company’s current hosting contracts are service contracts with a single performance obligation. The service the Company provides primarily includes hosting the\ncustomers’ miners in a physically secure data center with electrical power, internet connectivity, ambient air cooling and available maintenance resources. Hosting revenue is\nrecognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance. The Company recognizes hosting revenue to the extent\nthat a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur. Data center hosting customers are invoiced and payments are due on a monthly basis. While the majority of\nconsideration is paid in cash, certain consideration is payable in digital currency. Because digital currency is considered noncash consideration, fair value of the digital currency\naward received is determined using the quoted price of the related digital currency in the Company’s principal market at the time of contract inception. The Company has one\ndata center hosting contract with a customer, which expired in February 2024, for which the quoted price of bitcoin in the Company’s principal market at the time of contract\ninception was approximately $38,000. The Company recorded miner hosting revenue of $7.5 million and $4.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for mining pool revenue is comprised primarily of direct costs of electricity, but excludes depreciation which is separately presented. Cost of revenue for data\ncenter hosting is comprised primarily of direct costs of electricity, labor and internet provision.\nPower Curtailment Credits\nProceeds related to participation in demand response programs are recorded as a reduction in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations in the period\ncorresponding to the underlying associated demand response program period. The Company recorded demand response program amounts of approximately $3.5 million and\n$0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n55\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nHighly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company\nhad cash and cash equivalents of $54.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances primarily at two financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The\nCompany’s accounts at these institutions are insured, up to $250,000, by the FDIC. As of December 31, 2023, the Company bank balances exceeded the FDIC insurance limit\nby $17.9 million . To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institutions in\nwhich it holds deposits.\nThe Company previously held approximately $0.9 million in accounts with Signature Bank (“SBNY”). In March 2023, SBNY was closed by its state chartering authority, the\nNew York State Department of Financial Services. On the same date the FDIC was appointed as receiver and transferred all customer deposits and substantially all of the assets\nof SBNY to Signature Bridge Bank, N.A., a full-service bank that is operated by the FDIC. The Company transferred all funds out of Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. by April\n2023.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted cash in the\nconsolidated balance sheets and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company had no restricted cash as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The restricted cash of $7.0 million included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 was restricted primarily due to being held in escrow\nin accordance with an asset purchase agreement governing the sale of certain RM 101 assets (see Note 3).\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that total to the amounts shown in\nthe consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 54,439 $ 1,279\nRestricted cash — 7,044\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 54,439 $ 8,323\n56\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

From time to time, the Company also\nreceives bitcoin as distributions-in-kind from its joint venture. Digital currency is included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets due to the Company’s ability to\nsell it in a highly liquid marketplace and because the Company reasonably expects to liquidate its digital currency to support operations within the next twelve months. The\nCompany sells its digital currency on a first-in-first-out basis.\nDigital currency is accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment\nannually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount\nexceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether\n57\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nit is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not\nnecessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nThe Company has elected to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and to track its bitcoin activity daily for impairment assessment purposes. The Company\ndetermines the fair value of its bitcoin on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on quoted prices on the active trading platform that\nthe Company normally transacts and has determined is its principal market for bitcoin (Level 1 inputs), based on all information that is reasonably available. The Company\nperforms an analysis each day to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted price of bitcoin on the active trading platform, indicate\nthat it is more likely than not that its bitcoin are impaired. For impairment testing purposes, the lowest intraday trading price of bitcoin is identified at the single bitcoin level\n(one bitcoin). The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of bitcoin and the lowest daily trading price of bitcoin represents a recognized impairment loss. To the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of previously recorded impairment losses is prohibited. The Company\nrecognized impairment of digital currency of $3.0 million and $1.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDigital currency awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to cash used in operating activities on the consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. Proceeds from sales of digital currency are included within cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows and any\nrealized gains or losses from such sales are included in costs and operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The receipt of digital currency as\ndistributions-in-kind from equity investees are included within supplemental disclosure of noncash investing activities.\nConcentrations\nThe Company and its joint venture have contracted with two suppliers for the provision of bitcoin miners and one mining pool operator. The Company does not believe that\nthese counterparties represent a significant performance risk. Revenue from one data center hosting customer represents 10.9% and 20.8% of consolidated revenue for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company only operated bitcoin mining facilities; however, the\nCompany has made an initial commitment by allocating a 2 MW power block at the Lake Mariner Facility intended to support a broader HPC initiative. While the Company\nmay choose to mine other digital currencies or pursue other data center services in the future, it has no plans to do so currently. If the market value of bitcoin declines\nsignificantly, the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company may be adversely affected.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVariable interest entities (“VIE”) are legal entities in which equity investors do not have (i) sufficient equity at risk for the legal entity to finance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support, or (ii) as a group, the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact the entity’s\neconomic performance, or (iii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the legal entity. The Company\nwould consolidate any VIE in which it has a controlling financial interest through being deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE has\nboth of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb\nlosses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If both characteristics are met,\nthe Company considers itself to be the primary beneficiary and therefore will consolidate that VIE into its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon initial involvement with a VIE and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an\nongoing basis. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based upon facts and circumstances for the VIE\nand requires significant judgments such as whether the entity is a VIE, whether the Company’s interest in a VIE is a variable interest, the determination of the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic performance of the entity, whether the Company controls those activities, and whether the Company has the obligation to absorb losses\nof the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.\n58\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture, Nautilus Cryptomine LLC (“Nautilus”), with an unrelated co-venturer to develop, construct and operate up to3 00 MW of\nzero-carbon bitcoin mining in Pennsylvania (the “Joint Venture”). Due to the initial nature of the Joint Venture and the continued commitment for additional financing, the\nCompany determined Nautilus is a VIE. While the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over Nautilus, the Company has determined that it does not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Nautilus. Initially, the power to direct the activities of Nautilus that most\nsignificantly impact Nautilus’ economic performance were shared equally by both parties within the Joint Venture due to the requirement for both equity holders to approve\nmany of the key operating decisions and when not equally shared, were predominantly under the control of the co-venturer, including through the co-venturer’s majority\nrepresentation on the board of managers. As such, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Nautilus and, therefore, has accounted for this entity\nunder the equity method of accounting. Risks associated with the Company’s involvement with Nautilus include a commitment to potentially fund additional equity\ninvestments. The Company’s ownership interest in Nautilus was 25% as of December 31, 2023. See Note 11 for additional information.\nEquity Method of Accounting\nInvestee companies that are not consolidated, but over which the Company exercises significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Whether or\nnot the Company exercises significant influence with respect to an investee depends on an evaluation of several factors including, among others, representation on the investee\ncompany’s board of directors and ownership level, which is generally a 20% to 50% interest in the voting securities of the investee company. Under the equity method of\naccounting, an investee company’s accounts are not reflected within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations; however, the Company’s share of\nthe earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the caption “Equity in net loss of investee, net of tax” in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s\ncarrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the caption “Equity in net assets of investee” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest related to construction of assets at equity method investee companies is capitalized when the financial statement effect of capitalization is material, construction of the\nasset at the equity method investee has begun, the equity method investee has not commenced its principal operations and interest is being incurred. Interest capitalization ends\nat the earlier of the asset being substantially complete and ready for its intended use, the equity method investee commences principal operations or when interest costs are no\nlonger being incurred.\nWhen the Company’s carrying value in an equity method investee company is reduced to zero, no further losses are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements unless the Company has guaranteed obligations of the investee company or has committed additional funding. When the investee company subsequently reports\nincome, the Company will not record its share of such income until it equals the amount of its share of losses not previously recognized.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\nthe assets (generally 5 years for computer equipment and 4 years for miners). Leasehold improvements and electrical equipment are depreciated over the shorter of their\nestimated useful lives or the lease term. Property, plant and equipment includes deposits, amounting to approximately $36.5 million and $57.6 million as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, on purchases of such assets, including miners, which would be included in property, plant and equipment upon receipt.\nInterest related to construction of assets is capitalized when the financial statement effect of capitalization is material, construction of the asset has begun, and interest is being\nincurred. Interest capitalization ends at the earlier of the asset being substantially complete and ready for its intended use or when interest costs are no longer being incurred.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to\nundiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Any impairment loss recorded is measured as the\n59\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\namount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded no\nimpairment charges for long-lived assets.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and, if so, classifies the lease as an operating or finance lease. Operating leases are included in right-of-use\n(“ROU”) asset, current portion of operating lease liability, and operating lease liability, net of current portion in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases would be\nincluded in property, plant and equipment, current portion of finance lease liabilities, and finance lease liabilities, net of current portion in the consolidated balance sheets. The\nCompany does not recognize a ROU asset or lease liability for short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less and instead recognizes rent expense on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. In an arrangement that is determined to be a lease, the Company includes both the lease and nonlease components as a single component and accounts\nfor it as a lease when the Company would otherwise recognize the cost associated with both the lease and nonlease components in a similar fashion.\nROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising\nfrom the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date, and subsequently remeasured upon changes to the underlying lease arrangement, based\non the present value of lease payments over the lease term. If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company generally uses an estimate of its incremental\nborrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at the commencement date. The ROU asset also\nincludes any lease prepayments made and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably\ncertain that the Company will exercise that option.\nCosts associated with operating lease ROU assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses or selling, general and administrative, as appropriate, over the\nterm of the lease. Variable lease costs are recognized as incurred and primarily consist of common area maintenance charges not included in the measurement of right-of-use\nassets and operating lease liabilities. Finance ROU lease assets are amortized within operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses, as appropriate, on a\nstraight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The\ninterest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company was not a counterparty to any finance leases.\nDebt Issuance Costs and Debt Discount\nDebt issuance costs and debt discount are recorded as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of the debt and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest\nmethod over the contractual term of the debt and in consideration of expected future principal payments subject to an excess cash flow sweep (see Note 9). Debt issuance costs\ninclude incremental third-party costs directly related to debt issuance such as attorney and financial advisor fees. Debt discount includes upfront fees and proceeds allocated to\nother components included in the debt issuance. The allocation of proceeds between the debt instrument and any other components included in the debt issuance, including\ncommon stock or warrants to purchase common stock, is generally based on the relative fair value allocation method. All warrants granted by the Company as a component of\ndebt transactions are classified as equity in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDebt Modification\nThe Company evaluates amendments to its debt instruments in accordance with ASC 470-50,D ebt Modifications and Extinguishments. This evaluation includes comparing (1)\nif applicable, the change in fair value of an embedded conversion option to that of the carrying amount of the debt immediately prior to amendment and (2) the net present value\nof future cash flows of the amended debt to that of the original debt to determine, in each case, if a change greater than 10% occurred. In instances where the net present value of\nfuture cash flows or the fair value of an embedded conversion option, if any, changed more than 10%, the Company applies extinguishment accounting. In instances where the\nnet present value of future cash flows and the fair value of an embedded conversion option, if any, changed less than 10%, the Company accounts for the amendment to the debt\nas a debt modification. For debt that has been amended more than once in a twelve-month period, the debt terms that existed just prior to the earliest amendment occurring in\nthe prior twelve months are\n60\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\napplied to the 10% test, provided modification accounting was previously applied. Gains and losses on debt amendments that are considered extinguishments are recognized in\ncurrent earnings. Debt amendments that are considered debt modifications are accounted for prospectively through yield adjustments, based on the revised terms. Legal fees\nand other costs incurred with third parties that are directly related to debt modifications are expensed as incurred and generally are included in interest expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Amounts paid by the Company to the lenders, including upfront fees and the fair value of warrants issued, are included in future cash\nflows for accounting treatment determination and, if debt modification is applicable, are also included in the determination of yield adjustment.\nConvertible Instruments\nThe Company accounts for its issuance of convertible debt and convertible equity instruments in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP. In connection with that accounting,\nthe Company assesses the various terms and features of the agreement in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”), and ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities (“ASC 815”). ASC 480 requires liability accounting for certain financial instruments, including shares that embody an unconditional\nobligation to transfer a variable number of shares, provided that the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on one of the following three\ncharacteristics: (1) a fixed monetary amount known at inception, (2) variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares or (3) variations in the fair\nvalue of the issuer’s equity shares, but the monetary value to the counterparty moves in the opposite direction as the value of the issuer’s shares. In accordance with ASC 815,\nthe Company assesses the various terms and features of the agreement to determine whether or not they contain embedded derivative instruments that are required under ASC\n815 to be accounted for separately from the host contract and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of derivative liabilities, if any, is required to be revalued\nat each reporting date, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in the current period’s operating results.\nWarrants\nThe Company applies ASC 480 and ASC 815 to assist in the determination of whether warrants issued for the purchase of Common Stock should be classified as liabilities or\nequity. Warrants that are determined to require liability classification are measured at fair value upon issuance and are subsequently remeasured to their then fair value at each\nsubsequent reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings. Warrants that are determined to require equity classification are measured at fair value upon\nissuance and are not subsequently remeasured unless they are required to be reclassified. As of December 31, 2023, all outstanding warrants granted by the Company were\nclassified as equity.\nStock Issuance Costs\nStock issuance costs are recorded as a reduction to issuance proceeds. Stock issuance costs incurred prior to the closing of the related issuances, including under shelf\nregistration statements, are recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets if the closing of the related issuance is deemed probable.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company periodically issues restricted stock units (“RSU”) to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services. In accordance with ASC 718,\nCompensation – Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”), the Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award. For\nRSUs with time-based vesting, the fair value is determined by the Company’s stock price on the date of grant. For RSUs with vesting based on market conditions, the effect of\nthe market condition is considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not\nissued stock options.\nExpense for RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee’s or non-employee’s requisite service period, including the derived service period for RSUs with\nmarket conditions. Stock-based compensation for RSUs with market conditions is recorded over the derived service period unless the market condition is satisfied in advance of\nthe derived service period, in which case a cumulative catch-up is recognized as of the date of achievement. Stock-based compensation for RSUs with market conditions is\nrecorded regardless of whether the market conditions are met unless the service conditions are not met. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The Company\nrecognizes excess tax benefits or deficiencies on vesting or settlement of awards as discrete items within income tax benefit or provision within net loss and the related cash\nflows are classified within operating activities.\n61\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther Income\nOther income consists primarily of interest income on bank deposits. The Company recorded other income of $39,000 and $0 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, related to a disgorgement of short-swing profits arising from trades by a non-management insider under Section 16(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of\n1934.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires, among other things, an asset and\nliability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax\nassets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provision of ASC 740 related to\naccounting for uncertain income tax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is more likely than not that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing\nauthorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the\nguidance of ASC 740, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it\nis more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset\nor aggregated with other positions. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that\nhas a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with the tax positions taken that\nexceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated\ninterest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties that would be assessed in relation to the settlement value of unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax\nexpense. The Company did not accrue either interest or penalties for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nLoss per Share\nThe Company computes earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to common\nstockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the\nperiod had been distributed.\nBasic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the Company’s net loss attributed to common stockholders (adjusted for preferred stock dividends declared or\naccumulated) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Convertible preferred stock, which are participating securities because\nthey share in a pro rata basis any dividends declared on common stock but because they do not have the obligation to share in the loss of the Company, are excluded from the\ncalculation of basic net loss per share. Diluted loss per share reflects the effect on weighted average shares outstanding of the number of additional shares outstanding if\npotentially dilutive instruments, if any, were converted into common stock using the treasury stock method or as-converted method as appropriate. The computation of diluted\nloss per share does not include dilutive instruments in the weighted average shares outstanding, as they would be anti-dilutive. The Company’s dilutive instruments or\nparticipating securities as of December 31, 2023 include convertible preferred stock, common stock warrants, and RSUs issued for services. The Company’s dilutive\ninstruments or participating securities as of December 31, 2022 included convertible preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, common stock warrants and RSUs issued\nfor services. If the entire liquidation preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined in Note 14) was converted at its conversion price as of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany would issue approximately 1.1 million shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2023, Common Stock warrants outstanding were4 9,120,642 with a weighted\naverage strike price of $0.58 and total RSUs outstanding were 6,342,141.\n62\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision\nmaker, or decision–making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision–making group (“CODM”) is composed of\nthe chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief strategy officer. Currently, the Company solely operates in the Digital Currency Mining segment. The Company’s\nmining operations are located in the United States, and the Company has employees only in the United States and views its mining operations as one operating segment as the\nCODM reviews financial information on a consolidated basis in making decisions regarding resource allocations and assessing performance. Prior to the sale of substantially all\nof RM 101’s assets, through its ownership of RM 101, the Company operated in the Imaging Technology segment. TeraWulf classified the RM 101 segment as held for sale and\ndiscontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements (see Note 3).\nHeld for Sale and Discontinued Operations Classification\nThe Company classifies a business as held for sale in the period in which management commits to a plan to sell the business, the business is available for immediate sale in its\npresent condition, an active program to complete the plan to sell the business is initiated, the sale of the business within one year is probable and the business is being marketed\nat a reasonable price in relation to its fair value.\nNewly acquired businesses that meet the held-for-sale classification criteria upon acquisition are reported as discontinued operations. Upon a business’ classification as held for\nsale, net assets are measured for impairment. An impairment loss is recorded for long-lived assets held for sale when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value less\ncost to sell. Other assets and liabilities are generally measured for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their respective fair values. A long-lived asset is not\ndepreciated or amortized while it is classified as held for sale.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2022-03,F air Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions\n(“ASU 2022-03”). ASU 2022-03 was issued to (1) to clarify the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to\ncontractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security, (2) to amend a related illustrative example and (3) to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity\nsecurities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the accounting\nand disclosure requirements of ASU 2022-03 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08,I ntangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets\n(“ASU 2023-08”). ASU 2023-08 was issued to improve the accounting for and disclosure of crypto assets by requiring entities to subsequently measure crypto assets at fair\nvalue with changes recognized in net income each reporting period. This ASU also requires that entities present (1) crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other\nintangible assets in the balance sheet, and (2) changes from the remeasurement of crypto assets separately from the changes in carrying amounts of other intangible assets in the\nincome statement. Additionally, ASU 2023-08 requires that entities present cash receipts arising from crypto assets that are received as noncash consideration in the ordinary\ncourse of business and are converted nearly immediately into cash as operating activities. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.

The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.\nNOTE 3 – BUSINESS COMBINATION, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nOn December 13, 2021, the Company completed the Merger with RM 101 (formerly known as IKONICS Corporation) pursuant to which, among other things, the Company\neffectively acquired RM 101 and became a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq. The consideration in the Merger included, among other things, contractual contingent value\nrights (“CVR”) per a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the “CVR Agreement”). Pursuant to the CVR Agreement, each shareholder of RM 101 as of immediately prior to the\nMerger, received one non-transferable CVR for each outstanding share of common stock of RM 101 then held. The holders of the CVRs were entitled to receive9 5% of the Net\nProceeds (as defined in the CVR Agreement), if any, from the sale, transfer, disposition, spin-off, or license of all or any part of the pre-merger business of RM 101. Payments\nunder the CVR Agreement were calculated quarterly, paid on the sixtieth day after the respective quarterly calculation period and were subject to a reserve of up to 10% of the\nGross Proceeds (as defined in the CVR Agreement) from such transaction or more under certain conditions. The CVRs did not confer to the holders thereof any voting or equity\nor ownership interest in TeraWulf. The CVRs were not transferable, except in limited circumstances, and were not listed on any quotation system or traded on any securities\nexchange. The CVR Agreement terminated after all payment obligations to the holders thereof were satisfied.\nIn August 2022, RM 101 sold a certain property, including a warehouse, to a third party for $6.7 million gross with net sale proceeds of $6.2 million. The agreement governing\nthe sale included certain indemnifications which were subject to an $850,000 limitation and which expired in August 2023.\nIn August 2022, RM 101 sold (i) certain property, including a warehouse and a building which houses manufacturing, operations and administration, (ii) substantially all of its\nworking capital and (iii) its historical business to a third party for $7.7 million gross, including net working capital, with net sale proceeds of $7.0 million. The Asset Purchase\nAgreement (the “APA”) governing the sale was structured as an asset sale. The APA included certain indemnifications which were subject to a $650,000 limitation and a related\nescrow of that amount upon consummation of the transaction. Substantially all the remaining purchase price was placed into escrow upon consummation of the transaction\npending the completion of certain remaining environmental testing and remediation resulting therefrom, if any. As of December 31, 2022, proceeds from this sale were included\nin restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet. In February 2023, all escrowed funds were released to the Company.\nThe Company made CVR payments of $3.9 million, $5.7 million, and $1.4 million in February, May, and November of 2023, respectively. In accordance with the CVR\nAgreement, as of December 31, 2023, all RM 101 assets previously held for sale had been sold and the Company has made all of the aggregate distributions of $11.0 million of\nproceeds to the CVR Holders such that the CVR Agreement is deemed terminated as of December 31, 2023.\nUpon acquisition, the Company determined the RM 101 business met the assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations criteria and was, prior to sale, reflected as\ndiscontinued operations held for sale in these consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined that certain changes in\ncircumstances indicated that the then carrying amount of RM 101’s long-lived assets may not have been recoverable and recognized an impairment loss in loss on discontinued\noperations, net of tax of $4.5 million to write down the related carrying amounts to their fair values less estimated cost to sell. All net assets held for sale had been sold as of\nDecember 31, 2022. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax presented in the consolidated statements of operations includes the following results of RM 101 (in\nthousands):\n64\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

Total cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities from discontinued operations was $0.1 million and\n$(1.8) million in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNOTE 4 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As\nsuch, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for\nconsidering such assumptions, a three-level fair value hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques is used to measure fair value. The levels are as follows: (Level 1)\nobservable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; (Level 2) observable inputs for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly from market\ndata; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the\nCompany to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.\nThe following tables present the Company’s financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets on a non-\nrecurring basis, segregated by hierarchy fair value levels as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nFair Value Measured as of December 31, 2023\nSignificant Significant\nQuoted Prices Other Other\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nMarkets Inputs Inputs Remeasurement\nCarrying Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Gain (Loss)\nContingent consideration liability - Contingent Value Rights $ — $ — $ — $ — $ (64)\n$ — $ — $ — $ — $ (64)\n65\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

The carrying values of cash and cash\nequivalents, restricted cash, prepaid expenses, other receivables, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued construction liabilities, other accrued liabilities and other\namounts due to related parties are considered to be representative of their respective fair values principally due to their short-term maturities. There were no additional material\nnon-recurring fair value measurements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, except for (i) the calculation of fair value of Common Stock warrants issued in connection with\namendments to the Company’s long-term debt agreement (see Note 9), in connection with the issuance of Common Stock (see Note 16), in connection with a Common Stock\nexchange agreement (see Note 15) and on a standalone basis (see Note 15), (ii) the change in fair value of embedded derivatives in certain of the Company’s convertible\npromissory notes (see Note 15), and (iii) the calculation of fair value of nonmonetary assets distributed from the Company’s Joint Venture (see Note 11). The Company utilized\na Black-Scholes option pricing model to value its Common Stock warrants (except as discussed above for warrants issued in connection with the New Term Facility and the\nFifth Amendment) and to value the change in fair value of embedded derivatives in certain of the Company’s convertible promissory notes. The estimated fair value of the\nwarrants and embedded derivatives is determined using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. Inherent in the model and fair value estimate are assumptions related to expected share-price\nvolatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates volatility based on public company peer group volatility over the contractual term of\nthe warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the warrants or the conversion term, as\napplicable. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates will remain at zero.\nThe Company utilized a Black-Scholes option pricing model and the application of a discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”) to value its Common Stock warrants issued\nin connection with the New Term Facility and to value its Common Stock warrants issued in connection with the Fifth Amendment (each as defined in Note 9). The DLOM is\napplied primarily due to contractual restrictions on the exercise of the respective warrants. The estimated fair value of the warrants is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent\nin the model and fair value estimate are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and DLOM. The Company\nestimates volatility based on public company peer group volatility over the contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate on the\ngrant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the warrants, which is assumed to be equivalent to their contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate,\nwhich the Company anticipates will remain at zero. The Company applied a DLOM of 20% to value its Common Stock warrants issued in connection with the New Term\nFacility and applied a DLOM of 30% to value its Common Stock warrants issued in connection with the Fifth Amendment.\nNOTE 5 — BITCOIN\nThe following table presents the Company’s bitcoin activity (in thousands):\n66\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

The Ground Lease includes fixed payments and contingent payments, including an annual escalation factor as well as the\nCompany’s proportionate share of the landlord’s cost to own, operate and maintain the premises. The Ground Lease originally had an initial term of five years and a renewal\nterm of five years at the option of the Company, subject to the Company not then being in default, as defined.\nIn July 2022, the Ground Lease was amended to increase the initial term of the lease toe ight years and to amend certain other non-financial sections to adjust environmental\nobligations, site access rights and leasehold mortgage rights. In September 2022, the Company issued 8,510,638 shares of Common Stock with a fair value of $11.5 million as\ncompensation to the landlord for entering into the lease amendment. The Ground Lease, which is classified as an operating lease, was remeasured as of the date of the\namendment, resulting in an increase of $11.2 million to both right-of-use asset and operating lease liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The Ground Lease remained\nclassified as an operating lease based on the remeasurement analysis that utilized a discount rate of 12.6%, which was an estimate of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate\nbased on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at the remeasurement date. Upon expiration of the lease, the\nbuildings and improvements on the premises will revert to the landlord in good order.\n67\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company estimated a portion of its deferred tax assets will be utilized to offset the Company’s\ndeferred tax liabilities. Based upon the level of historical U.S. losses and future projections over the period in which the net deferred tax assets are deductible, at this time,\nmanagement believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the remaining deductible temporary differences, and as a result the Company\nhas recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, for the amount of deferred tax assets that will not be realized. The increase in the December 31, 2023\nvaluation allowance of $11.5 million is primarily attributable to the current year net loss.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and, 2022, for federal income tax purposes the Company had total net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $172.4 million and $96.3\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the net operating losses will have an indefinite carryforward as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but may be limited in\nutilization to 80% of taxable income. For state income tax purposes, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of\napproximately $30.8 million and $22.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2041.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any available federal or state research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nUnder the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state\ntax authorities. The Company has not completed a formal study to conclude whether an annual limitation may exist. Net operating loss carryforwards may become subject to an\nannual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to\noffset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change.\nSubsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years.\n70\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 740 which specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and recorded in the consolidated\nfinancial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the consolidated balance\nsheet; and provides transition and interim period guidance, among other provisions. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had not recorded any long-term liabilities\nfor uncertain tax positions. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense, if any, in\nits consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, no estimated interest or penalties were recognized on uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.

The Term Loans bear an interest rate of 11.5% and have a maturity date of December 1, 2024. Upon the occurrence and during the\ncontinuance of an event of default, as defined, the applicable interest rate will be 13.5%. The interest rate may be increased, if applicable, to the cash interest rate on any junior\ncapital raised plus 8.5%, if higher. As of December 31, 2023, no interest rate adjustments had been made under this provision.\nSubsequent to an amendment to the LGSA in March 2023 (the “Fifth Amendment,” as described below) and as of December 31, 2023, the Company is required to pay amounts\nsubject to an excess cash flow sweep, as defined, on a quarterly basis which will automatically extend to the maturity of the Term Loans in the event the Company repays at least\n$40.0 million of the principal balance of the Term Loans by April 1, 2024.

In connection with the issuance of the Original Term Loan, the Company incurred aggregate issuance costs of approximately $4.0 million, in addition to a $1.2 million\nupfront fee. The aggregate issuance costs and the upfront fee were allocated to the Term Loan Equity and the Original Term Loan based on the relative fair value method in the\namounts of $1.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively. For the Original Term Loan, this $4.1 million was included in debt discount along with the fair value of the Term Loan\nEquity, an amount of $25.7 million. The total of these items, an amount of $29.8 million, represented debt issuance costs and debt discount and was deducted from the Original\nTerm Loan proceeds and was being accreted into the long-term debt balance over the term of the debt at an effective interest rate of 12.9%, which was in addition to the stated\ninterest rate.\nIn July 2022, the First Amendment to the LGSA provided for an additional $50.0 million term loan facility (the “New Term Facility”). Pursuant to the New Term Facility, funds\ncould have been drawn in three tranches. The First Amendment Term Loan represented the first tranche and was drawn at closing in July 2022, and the subsequent tranches of\nup to $35.0 million (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment”) may have been drawn at Company’s option prior to December 31, 2022, subject to certain conditions,\nincluding the raising of matching junior capital, as defined. The New Term Facility required the Company to extend the initial term of the Ground Lease from five years to eight\nyears. In connection with the New Term Facility, the Company paid an upfront fee of $0.1 million and issued warrants to the lenders under the New Term Facility to purchase\n5,787,732 shares of Common Stock at $0.01 per share, an aggregate number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock equal to 5.0% (comprised of 2.0% related to the\nDelayed Draw Term Loan Commitment and 3.0% related to the First Amendment Term Loan) of the then fully diluted equity of the Company. In connection with the issuance\nof the New Term Facility, the Company also incurred aggregate issuance costs of approximately $1.5 million, in addition to the aforementioned upfront fee. If the Company\ndrew subsequent tranches, it was required to issue warrants to the lenders to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock equal to dilution of 3.75% upon the issuance of a\nsecond tranche in the amount of $15.0 million and 4.25% upon issuance of a third tranche in the amount of $20.0 million, in each case as a percentage of the then fully diluted\nequity of the Company, respectively.\nThe Company determined that debt modification accounting applied in connection with the New Term Facility. Third party and upfront fees were allocated pro rata between the\nFirst Amendment Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment. Third-party fees of $0.4 million related to the First Amendment Term Loan were expensed to\ninterest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Fees paid to lenders and the allocated value of the Common Stock warrants, an aggregate $3.5 million, related to\nthe First Amendment Term Loan were included with the unamortized discount on the Original Term Loan and were being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over\nthe remaining term of the Term Loans at an effective rate of 13.1%, which was in addition to the stated interest rate.\n72\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFees paid and the fair value of the Common Stock warrants related to the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment, an aggregate $3.4 million, were capitalized to other assets\n(the “Commitment Fee Asset”) and were amortized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period, which expired December 31, 2022. If a tranche of the Delayed Draw\nTerm Loan Commitment was drawn, the then related carrying value of the Commitment Fee Asset would be derecognized and a discount on debt would be recorded and\namortized over the term of the commitment drawn.\nIn October 2022, the Third Amendment to the LGSA divided the initial funding of up to $15.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment under the First\nAmendment to the LGSA into two tranches of up to $7.5 million each. The Third Amendment Term Loan represented the first tranche and was borrowed upon the closing in\nOctober 2022. In connection with the Third Amendment, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of the warrant agreement related to the New Term Facility.\nThe amended and restated warrant agreement provides that holders thereto are entitled to additional warrants to purchase an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock\nequal to an incremental 3.75%, to be divided into two separate increments of 1.875% each, of the fully diluted equity of the Company, determined on the date of the funding of\nthe two separate sub-tranches of $7.5 million each pursuant to the Third Amendment. In connection with the Third Amendment Term Loan, the Company issued warrants to\npurchase 2,667,678 shares of Common Stock at $0.01 per share. The fair value of the Common Stock warrants and the related proportional carrying value of the Commitment\nFee Asset, an aggregate $2.9 million, related to Third Amendment were included with the unamortized discount on the Original Term Loan and First Amendment Term Loan\nand were being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the Term Loans at an effective rate of 25.1%, which was in addition to the stated\ninterest rate.\nIn March 2023, the Fifth Amendment to the LGSA eliminated mandatory amortization of the Term Loans through April 7, 2024, as long as the Company received aggregate net\nproceeds of at least $33.5 million from the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities by March 15, 2023 (such condition, the “Amortization Relief Condition”). The\nCompany satisfied the Amortization Relief Condition on March 9, 2023. As a condition of the Fifth Amendment becoming effective, the Company entered into a warrant\nagreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) to issue the following warrants to the lenders: (i) 27,759,265 warrants to purchase an aggregate number of shares of the Company’s\nCommon Stock equal to 10.0% of the fully diluted equity of the Company as of the Fifth Amendment effective date with an exercise price of $0.01 per share of the Company’s\nCommon Stock (the “Penny Warrants”) and (ii) 13,879,630 warrants to purchase an aggregate number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock equal to5 .0% of the fully\ndiluted equity of the Company as of the Fifth Amendment effective date with an exercise price of $1.00 per share of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Dollar Warrants”).\nThe quantity of the Penny Warrants and the Dollar Warrants include the final impact of anti-dilution protection for additional capital raising transactions by the Company of up\nto $5.0 million subsequent to the $33.5 million aggregate net proceeds associated with the Amortization Relief Condition. The Penny Warrants are exercisable during the period\nbeginning on April 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2025, and the Dollar Warrants are exercisable during the period beginning on April 1, 2024 and ending on December\n31, 2026. In March 2023, in connection with the issuance of the warrants pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant\nto which the Company has agreed to provide customary shelf and piggyback registration rights to the LGSA lenders with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise\nof the warrants described above.\nThe Company determined that debt modification accounting applied in connection with the Fifth Amendment. Because the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment\noccurred within a twelve-month period, the debt terms that existed just prior to the First Amendment were applied in determining the appropriateness of the debt modification\naccounting model. The allocated value of the Penny Warrants and Dollar Warrants, an aggregate $16.0 million, related to the Fifth Amendment were included with the\nunamortized discount on the LGSA, as amended, and are being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the modified LGSA at an effective\nrate of 17.0%, which is in addition to the stated interest rate.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company amortized total debt issuance costs and debt discount of $21.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, of\nwhich $19.5 million and $9.3 million, respectively, were recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations, $1.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively,\nwere capitalized interest in property, plant and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and $0.5\nmillion and $2.3 million, respectively, were capitalized interest in equity in net assets of investee in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively.\n73\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

(“Yorkville”). Pursuant to the SEPA, the Company had the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell to Yorkville, subject to certain limitations and conditions, up to $50.0 million of its shares of Common Stock, at the Company’s request any time\nduring the commitment period commencing on June 2, 2022 and terminating on the earliest of (i) the first day of the month following the 36-month anniversary of the SEPA and\n(ii) the date on which Yorkville shall have made payment of any advances requested pursuant to the SEPA for shares of the Common Stock equal to the commitment amount of\n$50.0 million. In addition to the Company’s right to request advances, subject to certain conditions precedent, the Company had the option to, but was not obligated to, effect a\npre-advance loan with a principal amount of $15.0 million through the issuance and sale to Yorkville of a convertible promissory note (the “Promissory Note”).\nIn June 2022, the Company elected to issue and sell the Promissory Note to Yorkville. Subject to the terms of the SEPA, the Company had the right to terminate the SEPA at\nany time, at no cost or penalty, upon five trading days’ prior written notice so long as there are no outstanding advances, no outstanding balance on the Promissory Note and no\nother amounts owed to Yorkville. No termination of the SEPA affects the indemnification provisions contained within the SEPA, which provisions survive a termination. The\nSEPA was terminated in December 2022. No advances occurred while the SEPA was outstanding.\nYorkville Convertible Promissory Note\nIn June 2022, the Company issued the Promissory Note to Yorkville, which was issued with a2 .0% original issue discount, for proceeds of $14.7 million. The maturity date of\nthe $15.0 million Promissory Note was originally November 25, 2022 and the Company was required to pay the outstanding principal balance in five monthly $3.0 million\npayments commencing July 27, 2022. Upon reasonable advance notice, the Company had the right to defer 50% of a monthly payment amount due on two such monthly\npayments to later dates to be mutually agreed by the Company and Yorkville. In July 2022, $1.5 million of the $3.0 million July monthly payment amount was deferred until the\nOctober 2022 monthly payment due date. In August 2022, $1.5 million of the $3.0 million August monthly payment amount was deferred until the November 2022 monthly\npayment due date. The Promissory Note, which bore an interest rate of 4.0% and had an initial conversion price of $3.75 per share of Common Stock, may have been repaid\nwith the proceeds of a sale of Common Stock to Yorkville or repaid in cash and, if repaid in cash, together with a cash payment premium originally of 6.0%, provided that if the\nCompany’s Common Stock market price, as defined, was less than $2.25 per share, the cash payment premium would have been 4.0%.\nIn October and November 2022, the Company amended and restated the Promissory Note to, among other things, change the then-existing repayment schedule, change the cash\npayment premium to 12.0% and change the conversion price (the “First A&R Promissory Note” and “Second A&R Promissory Note,” respectively). The Company determined\nthat extinguishment of debt accounting applied to the First A&R Promissory Note in October 2022 because the change in the fair value of the embedded conversion feature was\ngreater than 10% of the carrying value of the Promissory Note immediately prior to the modification. The Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.1 million in\nthe consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. This extinguishment loss was primarily related to the change in the fair value of the embedded\nconversion feature of $1.6 million and the excess of the fair value of the amended and restated Promissory Note of $9.4 million over the carrying value of the Promissory Note\nimmediately prior to the modification. The Company determined that debt modification accounting applied to the Second A&R Promissory Note in November 2022 because the\nchange in the fair value of the embedded conversion feature was not greater than 10%\n74\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nof the carrying value of the First A&R Promissory Note immediately prior to the modification. The $20,000 change in the fair value of the embedded conversion feature was\naccounted for as a debt discount and amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the Second A&R Promissory Note at an effective rate of 3.1%.\nNo portion of the Second A&R Promissory Note was converted into shares of Common Stock and the Second A&R Promissory Note was paid in full in December 2022.\nConvertible Promissory Notes\nIn November 2022, the Company issued convertible promissory notes (the “Convertible Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.4 million to certain\naccredited investors, including to members of Company management in the amount of $1.7 million. The Convertible Notes were issued in privately negotiated transactions as\npart of a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Convertible Notes, which contained usual and customary antidilution\nprovisions, had a maturity date of April 1, 2025 and accrued annual interest at a rate of 4.0%, which would have increased to 15.0% upon the occurrence of an event of default,\nas defined. The Convertible Notes were originally automatically convertible into shares of equity securities of the Company upon the closing of a Qualified Financing, as\ndefined in the Convertible Notes as the issuance and sale of equity securities with an aggregate gross sales price of not less than $5.0 million, with certain sales of equity\nsecurities excluded, at a conversion price equal to the price per share paid by the investors purchasing such equity securities in such Qualified Financing. The Convertible Notes\noriginally embodied an unconditional obligation to settle a fixed monetary amount with, upon a Qualified Financing, a variable number of shares and was initially considered\npotentially share settled debt. In December 2022, the Company entered into a private placement (see Note 15) which met the definition of a Qualified Financing and\ncontemporaneously amended the Convertible Notes to (a) change the conversion date to March 1, 2023 and (b) allow for the conversion price to be reduced if an additional\nQualified Financing were to occur prior to the conversion date at a price lower than the then existing Convertible Notes conversion price. The Company determined that debt\nmodification accounting applied in connection with the December 2022 amendment to the Convertible Notes. There was no change to the effective interest rate as the result of\nthis amendment. As a result of the private placement, the conversion price was $0.40 per share of Common Stock. The Convertible Notes are included in convertible\npromissory notes in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In January 2023, the Convertible Notes were amended to change the conversion date to the third\nbusiness day following the Shareholder Approval Date (as defined in Note 15). In March 2023, the Convertible Notes and accrued but unpaid interest were converted into\n8,628,024 shares of Common Stock.\nIn January 2023, the Company entered into a convertible promissory note (the “January Convertible Note”) to an accredited investor in a privately negotiated transaction as part\nof a private placement exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D under the Securities Act in an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 million. The\nJanuary Convertible Note had a maturity date of April 1, 2025 and accrued annual interest at a rate of 4.0%. The January Convertible Note was automatically convertible into\nCommon Stock on the third business day following the Shareholder Approval Date (the “Conversion Date”) at a conversion price equal to the lowest price per share paid by\ninvestors purchasing equity securities in any sale of equity securities by the Company between November 25, 2022 and the Conversion Date with an aggregate gross sales price\nof not less than $5.0 million, subject to certain exclusions set forth in the January Convertible Note. The conversion price was $0.40 per share of Common Stock upon issuance.\nIn March 2023, the January Convertible Note and accrued but unpaid interest were converted into 3,134,932 shares of Common Stock.\nNOTE 11 – JOINT VENTURE\nIn May 2021, the Company and a subsidiary of Talen Energy Corporation (“Talen”) (each a “Member” and collectively the “Members”) entered into the Nautilus Joint Venture\nto develop, construct and operate up to 300 MW of zero-carbon bitcoin mining in Pennsylvania. In connection with the Joint Venture, Nautilus simultaneously entered into (i) a\nground lease (the “Nautilus Ground Lease”), which includes an electricity supply component, with a related party of Talen, (ii) a Facility Operations Agreement (the “FOA”)\nwith a related party of the Company and (iii) a Corporate Services Agreement (the “CSA”) with a related party of Talen. Each Member originally held a 50% interest in the\nJoint Venture. The Company capitalized a portion of the interest on funds borrowed to finance its investments in Nautilus prior to Nautilus commencing its principal operations.\nCapitalized interest costs were $0.9 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany received bitcoin distributions from Nautilus with a fair value of $21.9 million. The Company received no bitcoin distributions during the year ended December 31,\n2022.\n75\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn August 2022, the Members entered into an amended and restated Joint Venture agreement (the “A&R Nautilus Agreement”) whereby, among other changes, the unit\nownership will be determined by infrastructure contributions while distributions of mined bitcoin will be determined by each Member’s respective hashrate contributions.\nMembers are allowed to make contributions of miners up to the effective electrical capacity of their owned infrastructure percentage. Each party retains access to 50% of the\nelectricity supply outlined in the Nautilus Ground Lease. Additionally, the Company’s scheduled capital contributions were amended such that the Company would retain a\n33% ownership interest in the Joint Venture if such capital contributions were funded. With the change in ownership percentage, governance rights were amended to provide for\ngreater Talen board participation, among other changes. As allowed under the A&R Nautilus Agreement, the Company structured its capital contributions to achieve a targeted\n25% ownership interest in Nautilus.\nIn March 2023, the Members entered into a second amended and restated Joint Venture agreement (the “Second A&R Nautilus Agreement”). Under the Second A&R Nautilus\nAgreement, the Company holds a 25% equity interest in Nautilus and Talen holds a 75% equity interest in Nautilus, each subject to adjustment based on relative capital\ncontributions. Distributions are made periodically in accordance with each Member’s respective hashrate contributions after deducting primarily each Member’s share of power\nand operational costs. Pursuant to the terms of the Second A&R Nautilus Agreement, the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility initially requires 200 MW of electric capacity. Prior to\nMay 13, 2024, the Company may elect to expand the energy requirement of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility by up to 50 MW, funded solely by the Company. If the Company\nmakes such an election, the Talen Member may, within twelve months thereof, elect to expand the energy requirement of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility by up to an\nadditional 50 MW, funded solely by the Talen Member, for a total capacity of up to 300 MW. Upon such election, Nautilus will call additional capital for expansion and enter\ninto an additional energy supply agreement with the Talen Member or its affiliate for the additional capacity, subject to any regulatory approvals and third-party consents. In\nFebruary 2024, as allowed under the Second A&R Nautilus Agreement, the Company exercised its election to expand the energy requirements of the Nautilus Cryptomine\nFacility by an additional 50 MW.\nIn March 2021, the Company executed an agreement with MinerVA Semiconductor Corp. (“MinerVA”) for the purchase of3 0,000 MV7 miners, with originally scheduled\nmonthly deliveries of miners each between November 2021 and January 2022, for an aggregate price of $118.5 million (the “MinerVA Purchase Agreement”). Concurrently\nwith the execution of the Joint Venture agreement, TeraWulf assigned the MinerVA Purchase Agreement to Nautilus. Prior to December 31, 2022, total payments of $40.5\nmillion were made under the MinerVA Purchase Agreement. Production delays at MinerVA’s factory impacted the initial pricing and delivery schedule. Accordingly, Nautilus\nand MinerVA have deemed all payments made to date to apply to the initial approximately 9,000 miners shipped or to be shipped. As of December 31, 2023, Nautilus had not\namended the MinerVA Purchase Agreement.\nIn June 2021, Nautilus entered into two Non-fixed Price Sales and Purchase Agreements for the purchase of bitcoin miners from Bitmain Technologies Limited (“Bitmain”) for\na total of 30,000 S19j Pro miners, with originally scheduled monthly deliveries of 5,000 miners each between January 2022 and March 2022 under one agreement (the “Q1\n2022 Bitmain Agreement’) and 5,000 miners each between April 2022 and June 2022 under a second agreement (the “Q2 2022 Bitmain Agreement” and, together, the “Bitmain\nPurchase Agreements”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid Bitmain $22.8 million and was reimbursed by Talen for 50% of that amount. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the Q1 2022 Bitmain Agreement was concluded with all parties performing under the contract. In September 2022, the Q2 2022 Bitmain Agreement was\ncancelled whereby each Member received a $31.2 million credit with Bitmain to use at the respective Member’s discretion (the “Bitmain Credit”). See Note 12. The Company\nrecorded a distribution from the Joint Venture whereby equity in net assets of investee was reduced and property, plant and equipment, net was correspondingly increased by the\n$31.2 million distributed credit in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nIn December 2022, the Company entered into a Payment Netting Agreement with Nautilus, Talen and the related party FOA and CSA agreement counterparties whereby\ncertain amounts were owed by Nautilus to each of the FOA and CSA counterparties, including for the termination of the FOA agreement. These amounts were offset to arrive at\na net result whereby the Company owed the related party FOA counterparty (see Note 17) approximately $2.2 million. This amount was recorded in equity in net assets of\ninvestee in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company’s direct payments to MinerVA and Bitmain, among others, on behalf of Nautilus for the year ended December 31, 2022, are included in investments in joint\nventure, including direct payments made on behalf of joint venture\n76\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

The Members may\nseek alternate financing for the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, which could reduce the amount of investments each Member may be required to provide.\n(2) The maximum exposure at December 31, 2023 is determined by adding the Company’s variable interest in the entity and any explicit or implicit arrangements that could\nrequire the Company to provide additional financial support. The amount represents the contractually required capital contributions of the Company which were required for\nthe initial phase of the buildout of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.\nIn August 2022, due to the change in Member ownership percentage and governance rights under the A&R Nautilus Agreement, Talen determined it controlled the Joint\nVenture from an accounting perspective and thereby was required to fair value the identifiable assets and liabilities of the Joint Venture for its internal accounting purposes.\nUnder the CSA, Talen is responsible for maintaining the books and records of the Joint Venture and elected to push down the fair value adjustments to Nautilus’ books and\nrecords. The Company accounts for the Joint Venture as an equity method investment and the change in ownership percentage does not impact the Company’s method of\naccounting or basis. Therefore, there is a basis difference between the books and records of Nautilus and the Company’s accounting basis in the Joint Venture. The\n77\nTable of Contents\nTERAWULF INC.

The Company’s basis in the assets and liabilities of Nautilus continue to be recorded at\nhistorical value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nIn March 2022, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with Nautilus and the Nautilus co-venturer whereby the Company purchased2 ,469 of Nautilus’ Bitmain S19j\nPro miners (the “Nautilus Miners”) to be received under the Bitmain Purchase Agreements in exchange for an option to either (1) deliver miners that are not less favorable in all\nmaterial respects to those of the Nautilus Miners (the “Exchange Miners”) by July 1, 2022 or (2) incur a pro forma adjustment to Nautilus’ distributions such that the Nautilus\nco-venturer is made whole as though the miners had not been transferred to the Company. If the Exchange Miners were not delivered by September 30, 2022, the Nautilus co-\nventurer would have been entitled to elect to distribute in-kind a number of miners then in possession of Nautilus comparable to the then-undelivered Exchange Miners. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, the Nautilus Miners were received and recorded at fair value to property, plant and equipment, net in the amount of $16.0 million with a\ncorresponding recognition of an exchange miner liability of the same amount.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange\nAct, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of\nensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with this 2023 Form 10-K, our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer\nand chief financial officer (our “Certifying Officers”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under\nthe Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of\ndisclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent\nlimitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control\ndeficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and\nthere can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. The internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and our expenditures\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making the assessment of the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting, management has utilized the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission, (2013 framework) (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation under the COSO criteria, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs previously disclosed in Item 4, Controls and Procedures on Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2023, the Company identified a material\nweakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the inadequate design or operation of management’s review controls over classification in the consolidated\nstatements of cash flows of payments made related to business combinations. As of December 31, 2023, this weakness had been remediated with more robust and timely review\ncontrols over classification in the consolidated statements of cash flows of payments made related to business combinations to ensure that our consolidated financial statements\nare prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n87\nTable of Contents\nOther than the remediation of this previously identified material weakness as described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting\nthat occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial\nreporting.\nITEM 9B.

In addition, certain persons covered by our Securities Trading\nPolicy must advise our Chief Legal Officer before effectuating any transaction in our securities. Because the Company believes it is improper and inappropriate for any person\nto engage in short-term or speculative transactions involving the Company’s securities, it is the policy of the Company that directors, officers and employees of the Company,\nand their related persons, are prohibited from engaging in any of the following activities with respect to securities of the Company: (i) purchases of the Company’s stock of the\nCompany on margin generally; (ii) short sales; and (iii) buying or selling puts, calls, options or other derivatives in respect of the Company’s securities. The Company’s\nSecurities Trading Policy discourages speculative hedging transactions, but does permit directors, officers and employees of the Company to enter into long-term (12 months or\nlonger) hedging transactions that are designed to protect the individual’s investment in his or her shares of common stock or stock options of the Company, subject to the pre-\nclearance procedures outlined in the Securities Trading Policy.\nITEM 9C.

Please read this policy very carefully. All directors, officers and employees of the Company who are subject to the closed periods and pre-clearance procedures described in Parts V and VI of this policy should sign and return one copy of the policy to TeraWulf Inc. at 9 Federal Street, Easton, Maryland 21601; Attention: Office of the General Counsel.T he Poloicwyn sT fhivee C poemrcpeannt y(5’s% c)o omrm moonr es toofc kth ies Cpuobmlipcalnyy t’rsa dceodm. mThoen psutorcckh aisse s uobr jseaclte toof c,e ortra ointh reerp torartnisnagc trieoqnusi rienm, peunbtsl iuclnyd terra Sdeedct isoencu 1r3it(ides) ooff tthhee ECxocmhpaanngye wAhcti.l eY yoouu s ahroeu aldw acroen otafc mt tahteeC rioaml npoann-y p’su gbelince irnaflo cromuantsioenl, oorr thhies odris hcelor sduersei gonf eme,a itfe ryiaolu n noene-dp ufubrlitch einr fionrfmoramtiaotnio tno wotihthe rrse swpheoct tthoe tnh etrsaed ree ipno prtuinbgli colbyl itgraadtieodn ss.e Tcuhrei tCieos nosfe tqhuee Cncoems pTanhye iSse pcruorhitiibeist eadn db yE xfecdhearnagl es eCcoumritmieiss slaiowns .(F tehdee “rSalE sCec”u) raintide st hlaew ses ciumrpitoiesse elixacbhialintyg enso (te o.gn.l,y NonY pSeEr saonnds twheh oN tAraSdDe,A oQr w) ahroe teixpt rinemsideely i neffofercmtiavteio inn tdoe otethcteirnsg w inhsoi dtreard tera, dbiuntg o. nT hcoe mSEpaCn iaensd a tnhde oDthepera rctomnetnrot lolifn Jgu psteircseo hnas vwe hpor ofsaeilc tuot etdak cear esaesso innavbollev isntegp tsr atod ipnrge voer ntitp ipnisnidge br yt reamdipnlgo ybeye cs oamt aplalny employees. As a result, if we do not takea ctive steps to adopt preventive policies and procedures covering securities trades by personnel (including service providers) of the Company, the consequences could be severe.I n addition to responding to federal securities laws, we are adopting this policy to avoid the appearance of improper conduct on the part of anyone employed by or associated with theC ompany. We have all worked hard over the years to establish our reputation for integrity and ethical conduct. We cannot afford to have that reputation damaged. In addition to the limitations on trading contained in this policy, directors and officers of the Company are also subject to certain reporting requirements under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, any person who beneficially\n\nlevels of a business, trading or tipping by family members and friends, trading involving offshore accounts and trading involving only a small amount of stock. The consequences of insider trading violations can be severe: For individuals who trade on inside information, or tip inside information to others: • civil penalties of up to three (3) times the profit gained or loss avoided; • criminal fines (no matter how small the profit); and • jail terms. For a company (as well as possibly any supervisory person) that fails to take appropriate steps to prevent illegal trading, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, if any employee violates this policy, sanctions imposed by the Company, including dismissal for misconduct or cause, could result. Needless to say, any of the abovec onsequences, even an investigation by the SEC that does not result in prosecution, can tarnish the reputation of the Company, its management and the person involved, and irreparably damage a career. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Company’s general counsel, or his or her designee, directly.O nce again, please read this policy very carefully.

You will ber esponsible for compliance with this Policy by your Related Persons. For purposes of this Policy, references to “trading” or to “transactions in securities of theC ompany” include purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, bonds, options, puts and calls, derivative securities based on securities of the Company, gifts of the Company’s securities, loans of the Company’s securities, hedging transactions involving or referencing the Company’s securities, contributions of the Company’s securities to a trust, sales of the Company’s stock acquired upon the exercise of stock options, broker-assisted cashless exercises of stock options, market sales to raise cash to fund the exercise of stock options and\n\n2 • may pass that information on to any person outside of the Company or suggest or otherwise recommend that any such person outside of the Company effect at ransaction in securities of the Company or engage in any other action to take advantage of that information. This Policy will continue to apply after termination of employment to the extent that af ormer director, officer or employee is in possession of material non-public information at thet ime of termination. In such case, no transaction in securities of the Company may take place until the information becomes public or ceases to be material. This Policy also applies to information obtained in the course of employment with, or bys erving as a director of, the Company relating to any other company, including: • the Company’s clients, service providers or suppliers; • any entity with which the Company may be negotiating a major transaction or business combination; or • any entity as to which the Company has an indirect or direct control relationship or ad esignee on the boardc ohfa ndgireesc itno rds.i vNidoe nddir epcotloirc,i eosf foicr ethr eo rd eemclaprlaotyioene mofa ay setfofcekc ts tprlaint soarc tthioen osf ifne rtihneg soefc uarditdieitsi oonf aaln sye csuurcihti eos;t• h cehr acnogmesp ainn ys ewnihoirle m ina npaogsesmesesniot no ro fo tmheart ekreiayl enmonp-lpouybeleisc; information concerning such company that was obtained in the course of employment with the Company. Transactions that may be necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure) are no exception. Even the appearance of ani mproper transaction must be avoided to preserve the Company’s reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct. Material Information. “Material information” is any information that a reasonablei nvestor would consider important in a decision to effect a transaction in securities of theC ompany, i.e., any information that could reasonably affect the price of such securities. Either positive or negative information may be material. Examples of information that are oftenr egarded as material are: • projections of future earnings or losses or other guidance concerning earnings; • the fact that earnings are inconsistent with consensus expectations; • a pending or proposed merger, joint venture, acquisition or tender offer;• a significant sale of assets or the disposition of a subsidiary or business unit; •\n\n3 • significant new products or services;• significant legal or regulatory exposure due to a pending or threatened lawsuit or investigation; • impending bankruptcy or other financial liquidity problems; • changes in legislation affecting the Company’s business; and • the gain or loss of a substantial client, service provider or supplier. 20-20 Hindsight. If your transaction in securities of the Company becomes the subject ofs crutiny, it will be viewed after-the-fact with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, before engaging in any transaction, you should carefully consider how regulators and others might view your transaction in hindsight. Tipping Information to Others. Whether the information is proprietary information aboutt he Company or other information that could have an impact on the price of the Company’s securities, directors, officers and employees must not pass the information on to others. aP 4en0a1l(tkie)s wp lialln a (pifp layn dw whehtehne rt hoer nCootm ypoaun dye mrivaek,e os rt heev eCno imntpeanndy t’oss edceurirvitei,e sa nayn pinrovfeistt more ontth aelrt ebrennaetifvite furonmde r athneo t4h0e1r’(sk )a cptliaonn)s:.

However, if the information in question is contained in a regular quarterly earnings release and the release is issued prior to the opening of the market on a given day, trading may take place on the next business day following the day of release. Transactions under the Company’s Plans. Although this Policy does not generally apply to the exercise of employee stock options (other than cashless exercises as described below), it does apply to the sale of common stock received upon exercise. This Policy applies, however, tot he sale as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of a stock option and the market sale for the purpose of raising cash to fund the exercise of an option. This Policy also applies to the following elections under\n\n4 • pre-paying a loan if the pre-payment results in allocation of the proceeds to the Company’s securities. Confidentiality Obligations. The restrictions set forth in this Policy are designed to avoidm isuse of material non-public information in violation of the securities laws. These restrictions are in addition to, and in no way alter, the general obligations that each director, officer ande mployee of the Company has to maintain the confidentiality of all confidential or proprietaryi nformation concerning the Company and its business, as well as any other confidential information, that may be learned in the course of service or employment with the Company. No such information is to be disclosed to any other person in the Company, unless that person has a clear need to know that infodrmoeast ipoenr,m aint dl onnog s-tuecrhm i nhfeodrgminagti otrna nmsaayct iboen ds itshcalot saered dtoe saingyn etdh itrodp parrotiteesc,t eaxnc ienpdt iavsi drueqalu’isr eindv, elesgtmalelyn ta ignr etheed Ctoo morp oatnhye’rsw siesceu croitnietesm (ip.ela.,t ethde b hye ydogue rm fuunstc tbioe nf oorr p aot sleitaisotn t.w IeVlv.e A mDoDntIhTsI OanNdA reLl aPteR OtoH stIoBcIkT oErD oTpRtiAonNsS hAeCldT bIyO tNhSe iBndeicvaiudsuea tlh).e I fC yoomup wanisyh b teol ieenvgeasg iet iisn i manpyr osupcehr atrnadn sinaacptiporno, pyroiaut em fuosrt a pnrye -p celresaorn i tt oin e nacgcaogredi na nscheo rwt-ittehr mth eo rp rsep-eccluealartainvcee t rparnoscaecdtiuorness idnevsoclrvibinegd tihne P Carotm VpIa bneyl’osw s e(ceuvreinti eifs y, oitu i sa rthe en poot loicnye oofft hthe eC poemrspoannsy o tthhaetr wdiirseec troerqsu, ioreffdi cteor ss uabnmd iet myopulor ytreaens soafc ttihoen C ino mthpea Cnyo manpda nBye’os wsuelcfu Eri&tieDs ,f aonr dp rteh-ecilre Rarealnacteed).

Although you mayp ledge the Company’s securities as security for margin accounts, you are responsible for ensuring that foreclosure on any such account would not violate this Policy and you should be aware that sales of the Company’s securities could have securities law implications for you. • Short sales (i.e., selling stock you do not own and borrowing the shares to maked elivery). The SEC effectively prohibits directors and officers from selling the Company’s securities short. This Policy is simply expanding this prohibition to cover all employees of the Company and any employees or officers of Beowulf E&D. • Buying or selling puts, calls, options or other derivatives in respect of the Company’s securities. Although the Company discourages speculative hedging transactions, the Company\n\n5 V.

The trading plan must be properly documented and all of the procedural conditions of Rule 10b5-1 must be satisfied to avoid liability. Rule 10b5-1 plans allow transactions for the account of an insider1 to occur during blackout periods or while the insider has material non-public information provided the insiderh as previously given instructions or other control to effect pre-planned transactions in securities of the CompOafnfiyc eto o af tthhier dG peanretrya.l TChoeu innsseild. eEr vmenu stth eosutagbhl iesahc thh ter apnlasnac atito an t iemffee cwtehde nu hned eorr as hReu ilse 1n0obt 5in-1 p polsasne sdsoioens noof tm naeteedri taol nboe np-rpeu-bclleica riendfo, rifm tahteio tnra annsadc mtioany inso et fefexcetrecdis be ya nayn siunbsisdeeqru, eint tm iunsfltu been cmea odvee irn h aocwco, rwdahnecne o wr iwthh eRthueler 1to4 4e fafencdt mthues ttr bane sraecptoiorntesd.
