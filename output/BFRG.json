Organization and Nature of Business\nDescription of Business\nBullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. (“we”, “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada in February 2020. Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. is the parent company of\nBullfrog AI, Inc. and Bullfrog AI Management, LLC which were incorporated in Delaware and Maryland, in 2017 and 2021, respectively. All of our operations are currently\nconducted through Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc., which began operations in February 2020. We are a company focused specifically on advanced Artificial Intelligence and\nMachine Learning (AI/ML) driven analysis of complex data sets in medicine and healthcare. Our objective is to utilize our platform for a precision medicine approach to drug\nasset enablement through external partnerships and selective internal development.\nMost new therapeutics will fail at some point in preclinical or clinical development. These failures are the primary drivers for the high cost of developing new therapeutics. A\nmajor part of the difficulty in developing new therapeutics is efficient integration of complex and highly dimensional data generated at each stage of development to de-risk\nsubsequent stages of the development process. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) has emerged as a digital solution to help address this problem.\nWe use artificial intelligence and machine learning to advance medicines for both internal and external projects. Most current AI/ML platforms still fall short in their ability to\nsynthesize disparate, high-dimensional data for actionable insight. Our analytical platform is composed of an ensemble of state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial\nintelligence models. Our core platform technology, named bfLEAP™, is an analytical AI/ML platform developed at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory\n(JHU-APL) which is able to surmount the challenges of scalability and flexibility currently hindering researchers and clinicians by providing a more precise, multi-dimensional\nunderstanding of their data. We are deploying our analytical platform, including bfLEAP™, for use in several critical stages of development of internal programs and through\nstrategic partnerships and collaborations with the intention of streamlining data analytics in therapeutics development, decreasing the overall development costs by decreasing\nfailure rates for new therapeutics, and impacting the lives of countless patients that may otherwise not receive the therapies they need.\nThe proprietary analytical platform utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. As such, it is able to reveal real and meaningful connections in the data without\nthe need for a priori hypothesis. Algorithms used in the platform are designed to handle highly imbalanced data sets and successfully identify combinations of factors that are\nassociated with outcomes of interest. Our platform leverages models that use both correlative and causative machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches which\nprovide a comprehensive approach to predictive analysis which is expected to lead to meaningful insights including the molecular drivers of disease. In this regard, with our\naccess to proprietary data sets such as our strategic data and commercialization agreements with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (“LIBD”), we have increased our\ninternal efforts on target discovery.\nOur goal is to improve the odds of success at all stages of pre-clinical and clinical therapeutics development for in-house programs and for our strategic partners and\ncollaborators. Our business model includes enabling the success of ongoing clinical trials and rescuing late stage failed drugs (i.e., Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial failures) by\nbringing them in-house for development prior to eventual divestiture; although, we also consider entering collaborations for earlier stage drugs. We pursue our drug asset\nenhancement business by leveraging the powerful and proven bfLEAP™ AI/ML platform initially developed at JHU-APL. We believe the bfLEAP™ analytics platform is a\npotentially disruptive tool for analysis of pre-clinical and/or clinical data sets, such as the robust pre-clinical and clinical trial data sets being generated in translational R&D and\nclinical trial settings.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe Company has had negative cash flows from operations and operated at a net loss since inception. In the first quarter of 2023, we completed our initial public offering\n(“IPO”). In February 2024, we received net proceeds of approximately $5.7 million from an underwritten secondary public offering of common stock and warrants. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company has a cash balance of approximately $4.2 million. In October 2024, we received net proceeds of approximately $2.7 million from a\nregistered direct offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants, and concurrent private placement of common stock warrants. In the absence of significant revenues in\n2024 and 2025, the Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to fund planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2025.\n6\nAccordingly, we will require additional capital to continue to execute our strategy. We anticipate raising this additional capital through various avenues including sales of equity\nsecurities, debt transactions, licensing agreements and collaborative arrangements. Although management believes that such funding sources will be available, there can be no\nassurance that any such arrangements will be consummated to provide sufficient capital when needed to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms acceptable\nto us. If we do not raise sufficient funds in a timely manner, among other things, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all our research and product\ndevelopment programs and/or our capital expenditures or to enter into arrangements on unfavorable terms. We currently do not have commitments for future funding from any\nsource.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of\noperations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements do not include any\nadjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared\nin conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nThe condensed consolidated statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2024. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been\nprepared on a basis consistent with the audited annual consolidated financial statements included in Form 10-K and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments of a\nnormal recurring nature necessary to fairly state our financial position, our results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or any other\nfuture period.\nIn February 2023, we completed a 1-for-7 reverse split of our common stock. Stockholders’ equity and all references to shares and per share amounts in the accompanying\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue based on the following five step model:\n● Identification of the contract with a customer\nThis step outlines the criteria that must be met when establishing a contract with a customer to supply goods or services.\n● Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nThis step describes how distinct performance obligations in the contract must be handled.\n● Determination of the transaction price\nThis step outlines what must be considered when establishing the transaction price, which is the amount the business expects to receive for transferring the goods or\nservices to the customer.\n● Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nThis step outlines guidelines for allocating the transaction price across the contract’s separate performance obligations, and is what the customer agrees to pay for the\ngoods or services.\n● Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nRevenue can be recognized as the business meets each performance obligation. This step specifies how that should happen.\n7\nContract Services\nThe Company anticipates that the majority of its revenues to be recognized in the near future will result from discovery and monetization of new drug targets and intellectual\nproperty from data use partnerships focused on analysis of rich proprietary data sets. The target market for monetization will primarily be mid-size to large biopharmaceutical\norganizations seeking to build their new drug target pipeline. A secondary revenue channel is fee for service partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies and other\norganizations of all sizes that have challenges analyzing data throughout the drug development process. The Company provides the customer with an analysis of large complex\ndata sets using the Company’s proprietary Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning platform. This platform is aimed at predicting targets of interest, patterns, relationships,\nanomalies, and molecular drivers of disease. The Company believes that there will be additional on-going work requested from partners; therefore, the service model utilizes a\nmaster services agreement with work or task orders issued for discrete analysis performed at the discovery, preclinical, or clinical stages of drug development. The Company\nreceives a cash fee and, in some instances, the potential for rights to new intellectual property generated from the analysis. Once data analysis and the analysis report are\ncomplete, the Company delivers the analysis set to the customer and recognizes revenue at that point in time.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no new or material changes to the significant accounting policies discussed in the Company’s audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe Company has evaluated issued Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) not yet adopted and believes the adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\n3. Convertible Notes\nAugust 2021 Note\nIn August 2021, the Company entered into a convertible loan agreement with an unrelated party for a commitment of up to $195,000 with a 5% original issue discount and a\n9% interest rate.

The license covers three (3) issued patents, one (1)\nnew provisional patent application, non-patent rights to proprietary libraries of algorithms and other trade secrets including modifications and improvements. Our objective is to\nutilize our AI/ML platform with a precision medicine approach toward drug development with biopharmaceutical collaborators, as well as for our own internal clinical\ndevelopment programs. We believe the bfLEAP™ platform is ideally suited for evaluating pre-clinical and clinical trial data generated in translational research and clinical trial\nsettings that lead to faster, less expensive drug approvals.\n15\nOur aim is to improve the odds of success in each stage of developing medicine, ranging from early pre-clinical through late-stage clinical development. Our ultimate objective\nis to utilize bfLEAP™ to enable the success of ongoing clinical trials or rescue late-stage failed drugs (i.e., Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial failures) for in-house development\nand divestiture; although, we also consider entering collaborations for earlier stage drugs.\nIn September 2020 and October 2021, the Company executed amendments to the original February 2018 license which represents improvements and new advanced analytics\ncapabilities. In consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the original License Agreement, the Company granted JHU 178,571 warrants exercisable to purchase\nshares of common stock at $2.10 per share.\nIn July 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL that provides additional intellectual property rights including patents,\ncopyrights, and knowhow to be utilized under the Company’s bfLEAP™ analytical AI/ML platform. In consideration for the new license, the Company issued to JHU-APL\n39,879 shares of common stock. Under the terms of the new License Agreement, JHU will be entitled to eight (8%) percent of net sales for the services provided by the\nCompany to other parties and three (3%) percent for internally developed drug projects in which the JHU license was utilized. The new license also contains tiered sub\nlicensing fees that start at fifty (50%) percent and reduce to twenty-five (25%) percent based on revenues. The Company and JHU-APL entered into Amendment number 1 of\nthe July 2022 License Agreement whereby the Company gained access to certain improvements including additional patents and knowhow in exchange for a series of payments\ntotaling $275,000. The first of these payments for $75,000 was paid in July 2023 and the remaining payments of $75,000, $75,000 and $50,000 are due in years 2025, 2026 and\n2027, respectively. The amendment also reduced the 2023 minimum annual royalty payment to $60,000, all other financial terms remain the same. As a result of this\nAmendment, the minimum annual payments were $30,000 for 2022 and $60,000 for 2023, and the minimum annual payments will be $300,000 for 2024 and beyond, all of\nwhich are creditable by royalties. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued $225,000 of the 2024 minimum annual royalty payments.\nWe intend to continue to evolve and improve bfLEAP™, either in-house or with development partners like JHU-APL. We plan to leverage our proprietary AI/ML platform,\ndeveloped over several years at one of the top innovation institutions in the world which has already been successfully applied in multiple sectors.\nWe have staffed our business using funds from our initial public offering and have entered into partnerships and relationships and recently completed our first commercial\nservice contract with a leading rare disease non-profit organization for AI/ML analysis of late-stage clinical data. We have also acquired the rights to a series of preclinical and\nearly clinical drug assets from universities, as well as a strategic collaboration with a world-renowned research institution to create a HSV1 viral therapeutic platform to\nengineer immunotherapies for a variety of diseases. We have signed exclusive worldwide License Agreements with JHU for a cancer drug that targets glioblastoma (brain\ncancer), pancreatic cancer, and others. We have also signed an exclusive worldwide license from George Washington University for another cancer drug that targets\nhepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) and other liver diseases. In addition, we have signed three-year strategic data and commercialization agreements with the Lieber\nInstitute for Brain Development (“LIBD”) whom we believe has a repository of the largest collection of postmortem brains in the world including molecular, clinical, and other\ndata. The objective of this partnership is for the Company to analyze these rich data sets using its proprietary AI/ML tools and models and then go to market with the\ndiscoveries with the ultimate goal of securing revenue generating strategic partnership deals with biopharmaceutical companies. We intend to secure the rights to other\nproprietary data sets and repeat this strategy. Additionally, we intend to gain access to later-stage clinical assets through partnerships or the acquisition of rights to failed\ntherapeutic candidates for drug rescue. In certain circumstances, we intend to conduct late-stage clinical trials in an effort to rescue therapeutic assets that previously failed. In\nthese cases, there will be a requirement for drug supply and regulatory services to conduct clinical trials. The success of our clinical development programs will require finding\npartners to support the clinical development, adequate availability of raw materials and/or drug product for our R&D and clinical trials, and, in some cases, may also require\nestablishment of third-party arrangements to obtain finished drug product that is manufactured appropriately under Good Manufacturing Practices, and packaged for clinical use\nor sale. Since we are a company focused on using our AI technology to advance medicines, any clinical development programs will also require, in all cases, partners and the\nestablishment of third-party relationships for execution and completion of clinical trials.\n16\nSince completing our IPO in February 2023, aided by the receipt of the IPO proceeds in addition to the proceeds from our February 2024 and October 2024 offerings, we have\nimplemented several initiatives: investor relations and marketing to promote and raise awareness of the company in the financial and business sectors, research and\ndevelopment, collaboration with the J Craig Venter Institute and initiated preclinical studies with our in-licensed drug programs. The Company is actively engaged in\ndeveloping and pursuing new intellectual property as it strives to continuously evolve its AI/ML platform.\nInternally, the Company has added incremental staff to accelerate execution, and the development of processes and custom scripts for use in performing new drug target\ndiscovery and analytical services for customers, while also launching initiatives targeting large public health data sources and seeking access to proprietary health data sources,\nsuch as our agreement with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development. We also transitioned our accounting and financial reporting systems and processes to enhance our\ninternal control environment as a public company. Capital from the IPO was also used to retire two notes that were sold to fund the Company through the IPO that did not\nconvert into common stock as well as other debts accrued over time to our staff, employees and consultants as well as obligations related to the acquisition of our licensed drug\nprograms.\nThe Company has had negative cash flows from operations and operated at a net loss since inception. In the first quarter of 2023, we completed our initial public offering\n(“IPO”). In February 2024, we received net proceeds of approximately $5.7 million from an underwritten secondary public offering of common stock and warrants. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company has a cash balance of approximately $4.2 million. In October 2024, we received net proceeds of approximately $2.7 million from a\nregistered direct offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants, and concurrent private placement of common stock warrants. In the absence of significant revenues in\n2024 and 2025, the Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to fund planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2025.\nAccordingly, we will require additional capital to continue to execute our strategy. We anticipate raising this additional capital through various avenues including sales of equity\nsecurities, debt transactions, licensing agreements and collaborative arrangements. Although management believes that such funding sources will be available, there can be no\nassurance that any such arrangements will be consummated to provide sufficient capital when needed to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms acceptable\nto us. If we do not raise sufficient funds in a timely manner, among other things, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all our research and product\ndevelopment programs and/or our capital expenditures or to enter into arrangements on unfavorable terms. We currently do not have commitments for future funding from any\nsource.\nOur Strategy\nThe Company has a unique strategy designed to reduce risk and increase the frequency of cash flow. The first part of the strategy is to generate revenues through strategic\nrelationships with biopharma companies. These relationships will be structured as a combination of fees and intellectual property based on the specific scope of the\nengagement. The objective of these engagements will be to uncover valuable insights to reduce the risk and/or increase the speed of the drug development process which can be\nachieved through manual or automated integration into the client’s workflow or analysis of discrete data sets.\nIn the future, the second part of our strategy involves acquiring the rights to drugs at various stages of development, using our proprietary AI/ML technology to advance the\ndevelopment and make discoveries, with the objective of creating near term value and then exiting and monetizing as quickly as possible, preferably within approximately 30\nmonths.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates\nare based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as those described in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n17\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWhile we generated our first revenues in late 2022 from our services provided to a pharmaceutical customer, we completed our first commercial service contract and recognized\nrevenue in the amount of $65,000 in the third quarter of 2023. We did not generate any revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nResearch and Development Costs and Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to the acquisition of licensed technology, annual minimum royalty fees payable until commercialization,\nfees paid to external service providers and internal costs for personnel working on research and development activities, including work on our proprietary platform which\nutilizes bfLEAP™ and an ensemble of AI/ML tools and models.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Estimates are used in determining the expense liability of certain costs where services have been performed but not\nyet invoiced.\nWe anticipate our research and development costs continuing to increase as we execute on our business plan and begin conducting preclinical research and development\nactivities directed at securing development partners and filing an Investigational New Drug application for our licensed drug development programs described in this filing, as\nwell as under strategic partnerships and for other drug development programs we may pursue. Further, we anticipate our research and development costs will increase as we add\nadditional staff and perform analytical work aimed at target discovery on proprietary data sets through our partnering efforts as well as with prospective customers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation, as well as accounting and consulting services,\ninsurance expense, and legal fees relating to corporate matters. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our target\ndiscovery efforts, service offerings, and clinical and pre-clinical research and development activities associated with strategic partnering and collaborations.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nSeptember 30, Net Change\n2024 2023\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 566,584 $ 380,015 $ 186,569\nGeneral and administrative 1,253,357 983,929 269,428\nTotal operating expenses $ 1,819,941 $ 1,363,944 $ 455,997\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to\nincreased personnel costs related to the hiring of several additional technical staff as well as our Chief Science Officer. In addition, in the first quarter of 2024, we engaged\ndisease experts as area consultants, we expanded our target discovery efforts, and we also initiated a preclinical obesity study related to siRNA program. We expect our R&D\nexpenses to increase as we begin the validation process on potential targets identified in our target discovery program.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to\nincreased personnel costs related to the hiring of several additional staff, as well as associated increases in equity compensation costs and recruiting fees as we work to expand\nour technical staff and capabilities.\n18\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income generated from cash held in an overnight sweep account increased by $4,531 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period\nended September 30, 2023.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nSeptember 30, Net Change\n2024 2023\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 1,632,409 $ 1,023,619 $ 608,790\nGeneral and administrative 3,835,213 3,067,940 767,273\nTotal operating expenses $ 5,467,622 $ 4,091,559 $ 1,376,063\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to\nincreased personnel costs related to the hiring of several additional technical staff as well as our Chief Science Officer.

Interest income generated from cash held in an overnight sweep account increased by $62,193 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in our average cash balances.\nResults of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn 2022, the Company received net proceeds from the sale of Convertible Bridge Notes of approximately $1,016,000 and repaid unsecured promissory notes sold in 2021 in the\namount of $49,000. The Company sold one additional promissory note and received net proceeds of $100,000 in January 2023.\nThrough September 30, 2024, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $15.1 million and has funded its operations through the sale of common stock and\ndebt. We anticipate that our expenses will increase in the future to support our target discovery activities, service offerings, clinical and pre-clinical research and development\nactivities associated with strategic partnering and collaborations, as well as acquired product candidates and the increased costs of operating as a public company.\nThe Company’s current entities include Bullfrog AI, Inc. and Bullfrog Management, LLC, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc., which is a\nholding company that depends upon the sale of its securities and cash generated through its subsidiaries to fund consolidated operations.\n19\nOn February 16, 2023, the Company completed its IPO of 1,297,318 units (each, a “Unit,” collectively, the “Units”) at a price of $6.50 per unit for a total of approximately $8.4\nmillion of gross proceeds to the Company. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, one tradeable warrant (each, a “Tradeable Warrant,” collectively,\nthe “Tradeable Warrants”) to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.80 per share, and one non-tradeable warrant (each, a “Non-tradeable Warrant,”\ncollectively, the “Non-tradeable Warrants”; together with the Tradeable Warrants, each, a “Warrant,” collectively, the “Warrants”) to purchase one share of the Company’s\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $8.125. In connection with the IPO, the Company also completed a 1-for-7 reverse stock split of our common stock.\nIn connection with the IPO, a SAFE and convertible loan agreement held by a related party converted into 55,787 shares of common stock. Additionally, all outstanding\nconvertible bridge notes and accrued interest through November 30, 2022 were converted into 276,289 shares of common stock and 276,289 warrants to purchase common\nstock and were issued to the Convertible Bridge Note holders at conversion. The convertible bridge note conversions and the warrant exercise pricing were determined using a\n$25 million company valuation immediately before the IPO.\nIn April 2023, the holders of warrants exercised 436,533 warrants for common stock at various exercise prices and the Company received proceeds of approximately\n$1,495,000.\nIn February 2024, we completed an underwritten secondary offering of common stock and warrants generating approximately $5.7 million of net proceeds.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, holders exercised warrants (including prefunded warrants from the secondary offering) to purchase 508,814 shares of common stock generating\nproceeds of approximately $106,000.\nIn October 2024, we completed a registered direct offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants, and concurrent private placement of common stock warrants generating\napproximately $2.7 million of net proceeds.\nIn the absence of significant revenues in 2024 and 2025, management believes the Company’s capital resources are sufficient to fund planned operations into the fourth quarter\nof 2025. Accordingly, we will seek additional capital to continue to execute our strategy as discussed above.\nConsolidated Cash Flow Data\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nNet cash (used in) provided by\nOperating activities $ (4,338,214) $ (4,983,282) $ 645,068\nInvesting activities - - -\nFinancing activities 5,952,472 8,781,649 (2,829,177)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,614,258 $ 3,798,367 $ (2,184,109)\nCash Flows Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to paying\ndown payables and accrued expenses for technology access, consultants, and compensation in 2023, partially offset by increased operating costs in 2024.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nThere was no cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to\nproceeds from our Initial Public Offering in February 2023 exceeding the proceeds from our secondary offering in February 2024.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nAs a smaller reporting company, this disclosure is not required.\n20\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe are required to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and\nevaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is\nbased in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all\npotential future conditions. We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the reporting period covered in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the identified material\nweaknesses, our management has concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this quarterly filing on Form 10-Q, and the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows as of and for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement has identified material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting at December 31, 2023. Specifically, Management noted the Company did not\nproperly document, implement or operate a system of effective internal controls over financial reporting.\nOngoing Remediation Efforts\nManagement is in the process of implementing improvements to its internal controls over financial reporting. Namely the Company has and is continuing to:\n● transitioned its day-to-day accounting processes to a new external firm including automating its vendor payments;\n● initiated the transfer of the overall accounting process to an enterprise type accounting platform;\n● periodically review the design and effectiveness of our controls including the creation of an annual risk assessment and ongoing monitoring activities; and\n● evaluate all internal and external resources to ensure they are appropriate for the level and complexity of our current operations. This includes the recent hiring of a\nCorporate Controller.\nWhile we believe that these efforts will improve our internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of these measures is ongoing and will require validation and\ntesting of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or\nimprovements, as necessary and as funds allow. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or that we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate\nthe material weaknesses we have identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1 Legal Proceedings.\nTo our best knowledge, we are currently not a party to any legal proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, are deemed to be material to our financial condition or results\nof operations.\nItem 1A Risk Factors.\nSmaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.\nItem 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nThere were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nItem 3 Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNone.\n21\nItem 4 Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5 Other Information.\n(c) Insider Trading Arrangements\nTrading Plans\nOn June 6, 2023, Vininder Singh, the Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company, entered into a 10b5-1 sales plan (the “10b-5 Sales Plan”) intended to satisfy the\naffirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The 10b5 Sales Plan provides for the sale of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock and will remain in effect\nuntil the earlier of (1) September 30, 2024; or (2) the date on which an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock have been sold under the 10b5 Sales Plan. Pursuant to\nthe 10b5 Sales Plan, 50,000 shares were sold under the plan in September 2023, 100,000 shares were sold under the plan in the first quarter of 2024, and 50,000 shares were\nsold under the plan in each of the second and third quarters of 2024. In May 2024, the 10b-5 Sales Plan was extended until August 31, 2025, no other adjustments were made to\nthe plan.\nNo other directors or executive officers of the Company adopted, modified or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of the Company’s\nsecurities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5 trading arrangement, (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation\nS-K) during the quarterly period covered by this report.\nItem 6.

BUSINESS\nOur Corporate History and Background\nBullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 6, 2020. Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. is the parent company of Bullfrog AI, Inc. and Bullfrog AI\nManagement, LLC. which were incorporated in Delaware and Maryland, in 2017 and 2021, respectively. All of our operations are currently conducted through BullFrog AI\nHoldings, Inc. The Company’s principal business address is 325 Ellington Blvd, Unit 317, Gaithersburg, MD 20878. Our website address is www.bullfrogai.com. The\nreferences to our website in this Form 10-K are inactive textual references only. The information on our website is neither incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\nAcquisition of BullFrog AI, Inc.\nIn March 2020, BullFrog AI, Inc. received an investment from TEDCO - the Technology Development Corporation of Maryland, a State of Maryland Investment Fund –\npursuant to the issuance of a $200,000 convertible note with an 18-month term, 6% annual interest rate, and a 20% discount. In June 2020, BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc. acquired\nBullFrog AI, Inc. pursuant to an exchange agreement under which each share of Bull Frog AI, Inc. common stock was exchanged for a share of common stock of BullFrog AI\nHoldings, Inc. Immediately prior to the share exchange, each outstanding common share of BullFrog AI, Inc. was split into 25 shares of common stock. Pursuant to the\nagreement, 24,223,975 shares of the Company’s common stock were issued to the shareholders of BullFrog AI, Inc. in exchange for 100% of the outstanding stock of BullFrog\nAI, Inc. Upon completion of the exchange, BullFrog AI, Inc. became the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary and the shareholders of BullFrog AI, Inc. held 100% of the\ncommon stock of the Company. As a result, BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc. assumed a total of $330,442 in net liabilities of BullFrog AI, Inc. Both of the entities were controlled\nbefore and after the transactions by the same controlling shareholder.\nBullFrog AI Corporate History\nBullFrog AI, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 25, 2017. Vininder Singh is the founder, CEO and chairman of BullFrog AI.\nBusiness Overview\nMost new therapeutics will fail at some point in preclinical or clinical development. This is the primary driver of the high cost of developing new therapeutics. A major part of\nthe difficulty in developing new therapeutics is efficient integration of complex and highly dimensional data generated at each stage of development to de-risk subsequent\nstages of the development process. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) has emerged as a digital solution to help address this problem.\nWe use artificial intelligence and machine learning to advance medicines for both internal and external projects. We are committed to increasing the probability of success and\ndecreasing the time and cost involved in developing therapeutics. Most current AI/ML platforms still fall short in their ability to synthesize disparate, high-dimensional data for\nactionable insight. Our platform technology, named, bfLEAP™, is an analytical AI/ML platform derived from technology developed at The Johns Hopkins University Applied\nPhysics Laboratory (JHU-APL), which is able to surmount the challenges of scalability and flexibility currently hindering researchers and clinicians by providing a more\nprecise1, multi-dimensional understanding of their data. We are deploying bfLEAP™ for use at several critical stages of development for internal programs and through\nstrategic partnerships and collaborations with the intention of streamlining data analytics in therapeutics development, decreasing the overall development costs by decreasing\nfailure rates for new therapeutics, and impacting the lives of countless patients that may otherwise not receive the therapies they need.\n1 In an August 2021 publication in DeepAI.org (https://deepai.org/publication/random-subspace-mixture-models-for-interpretable-anomaly-detection), the algorithms used in\nbfLEAP were compared to 10 of the most popular clustering algorithms in the world using 12 data sets. The end result showed that the algorithms used in bfLEAP had the\nhighest average score when measuring speed and accuracy of prediction. The bfLEAP platform currently has more advanced versions of these algorithms and is applying them\nin multiple data analytics projects.\n2\nRecent Developments\nOn February 26, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Dr. Thomas W. Chittenden, PhD, DPhil, PStat, as its new Chief Scientific Officer.\nOn January 31, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with WallachBeth Capital, LLC as representative of the several underwriters named therein, relating\nto the issuance and sale of an aggregate of (i) 1,028,710 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share and 478,429 pre-funded warrants in lieu of common stock (“Pre-\nFunded Warrants”) or 1,507,139 shares of common stock (or Pre-Funded Warrants) in lieu thereof, and accompanying warrants to purchase 1,507,139 shares of common stock\nat a combined public offering price of $3.782 per share (inclusive of the Pre-Funded Warrant exercise price) for gross proceeds of approximately $5,700,000, prior to deducting\nunderwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nOur Strategy\nWe plan to achieve our business objectives by enabling the successful development of drugs and biologics using a precision medicine approach via our proprietary artificial\nintelligence platform bfLEAP. The bfLEAP™ platform utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning - as such, it is able to reveal real/meaningful connections in\nthe data without the need for a prior hypothesis. Supervised machine learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not. In\nsupervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. Unsupervised learning,\nalso known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data\ngroupings without the need for human intervention. Algorithms used in the bfLEAP™ platform are designed to handle highly imbalanced data sets to successfully identify\ncombinations of factors that are associated with outcomes of interest.\nTogether with our strategic partners and collaborators, our primary goal is to improve the odds of success at any stage of pre-clinical and clinical therapeutics development. Our\nprimary business model is improving the success and efficiency of drug development which is accomplished either through acquisition of drugs or partnerships and\ncollaborations with companies that are developing drugs. We hope to accomplish this through strategic acquisitions of current clinical stage and failed drugs for in-house\ndevelopment, or through strategic partnerships with biopharmaceutical industry companies. We are able to pursue our drug asset enhancement business by leveraging a\npowerful and proven AI/ML platform (trade name: bfLEAP™) initially derived from technology developed at JHU-APL. We believe the bfLEAP™ analytics platform is a\npotentially disruptive tool for analysis of pre-clinical and/or clinical data sets, such as the robust pre-clinical and clinical trial data sets being generated in translational R&D and\nclinical trial settings. In November 2021, we amended the agreement with JHU-APL to include additional advanced AI technology. On July 8, 2022, the Company entered into\nan exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL for the additional technology developed to enhance the bfLEAP™ platform. The July 8, 2022 JHU-APL\nlicense provides the Company with new intellectual property and also encompasses most of the intellectual property from the February 2018 license.\nWe believe bfLEAP™ will inform/enable decision making throughout the development cycle:\n● Discovery Phase - Analyze and categorize discovery phase data to better define highest-value leads from groups of candidates, for advancement to preclinical phase of\ndevelopment. Integrate data from high-throughput screening, pharmacodynamics assays, pharmacokinetics assays, and other key data sets to create the most accurate\nprofile of a pool of therapeutic candidates. There is often a high degree of similarity among closely related therapeutics in a candidate pool - bfLEAP™ is able to\nharmonize disparate data streams for a more nuanced understanding of each candidate’s characteristics/potency.\n● Pre-Clinical Data - Large-scale/multivariate analysis of pre-clinical and/or early-stage clinical data sets. In these settings, bfLEAP could be used to find novel drug\ntargets, elucidate mechanism of action (MOA), predict potential off-target effects/side effects, uncover specific genetic/phenotypic background(s) with highest\ncorrelation to therapeutic response, etc. These insights from bfLEAP™ analysis can be used to inform decision making/study design at the subsequent step(s) of\ntherapeutic/diagnostic development, including first-inhuman/Phase I RCTs.\n● Clinical Development - Advanced/multivariate analysis of PhI and/or PhII clinical trials data, to find niche populations of highly responsive patients and/or inform\npatient selection for later-stage CT(s). This can be used to decrease overall study risk for larger clinical trials - including Phase II trials, and any Phase III Registration\nClinical Trials. The bfLEAP™ platform analysis can also be used to more precisely understand complex correlations between therapeutic treatment and adverse\nevents, side effects, and other undesirable responses which could jeopardize clinical trial success.\n3\nOur platform is agnostic to the disease indication or treatment modality and therefore we believe that it is of value in the development of biologics or small molecules.\nThe process for our drug asset enhancement program is to:\n● acquire the rights to a drug from a biopharmaceutical industry company or academia;\n● use the proprietary bfLEAP™ AI/ML platform to determine a multi-factorial profile for a patient that would best respond to the drug;\n● rapidly conduct a clinical trial to validate the drug’s use for the defined “high-responder” population; and\n● divest/sell the rescued drug asset with the new information back to a large player in the pharma industry, following positive results of the clinical trial.\nAs part of our strategy, we will continue evolving our intellectual property, analytical platform and technologies, build a large portfolio of drug candidates, and implement a\nmodel that reduces risk and increases the frequency of cash flow from rescued drugs. This strategy will include strategic partnerships, collaborations, and relationships along\nthe entire drug development value chain, as well as acquisitions of the rights to developing failed drugs and possibly the underlying companies.\nTo date, we have not conducted clinical trials on any pharmaceutical drugs and our platform has not been used to identify a drug candidate that has received regulatory approval\nfor commercialization. However, we currently have a strategic relationship with a leading rare disease non-profit organization for artificial intelligence/machine learning\n(“AI/ML”) analysis of late-stage clinical data. We have acquired the rights to a series of preclinical and early clinical drug assets from universities and entered into a strategic\ncollaboration with a world-renowned research institution to create a HSV1 viral therapeutic platform to engineer immunotherapies for colorectal cancer. We have signed\nexclusive worldwide license agreements with Johns Hopkins University for a cancer drug that targets glioblastoma (brain cancer), pancreatic cancer, and other cancers. We have\nalso signed an exclusive worldwide license with George Washington University for another cancer drug that targets hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and other liver\ndiseases.\nOur platform was originally developed by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (“JHU-APL”). JHU-APL uses the same technology for applications\nrelated to national defense. Over several years, the software and algorithms have been used to identify relationships, patterns, and anomalies, and make predictions that\notherwise may not be found. These discoveries and insights provide an advantage when predicting a target of interest, regardless of industry or sector. We have applied the\ntechnology to various clinical data sets and have identified novel relationships that may provide new intellectual property, new drug targets, and other valuable information that\nmay help with patient stratification for a clinical trial thereby improving the odds for success. The platform has not yet aided in the development of a drug that has reached\ncommercialization. However, we have licensed one drug candidate that has completed a Phase 1 trial and a second candidate that is in the preclinical stages. Our aim is to use\nour technology on current and future available data to help us better determine the optimal path for development.\nWhile we have not generated significant revenues from our AI/ML operations, we anticipate generating revenue in the future from the following three sources:\nContract Services\nOur fee for service partnership offering model is designed for biopharmaceutical companies, as well as other organizations, of all sizes that have challenges analyzing data\nthroughout the drug development process. We provide the customer with an analysis of large complex data sets using our proprietary Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning\nplatform called bfLEAP™. This platform is designed to predict targets of interest, patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Our service model involves a cash fee plus the\npotential for rights to new intellectual property generated from the analysis, which can be performed at the discovery, preclinical, or clinical stages of drug development.\n4\nCollaborative Arrangements\nWe plan to enter into collaborative arrangements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies who have drugs that are in development or have failed late Phase 2 or\nPhase 3 trials. The collaborations may also be at the discovery or preclinical stages of drug development. Our revenue will be a combination of fee for service cash payments\nand success fees based on achieving certain milestones as determined by each specific arrangement. There may also be fees or legal rights associated with the development of\nnew intellectual property.\nAcquisition of Rights to Certain Drugs\nWe may acquire the rights to drugs that have failed late Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials and generate revenues by using our platform to accurately determine the profile of patients that\nwould respond to the drugs, conduct a clinical trial to test our findings either independently or with a clinical partner, and finally sell the drug back to pharmaceutical\ncompanies. We have and may continue acquiring the rights to drugs that have not yet failed any trials. We will use our technology to improve the chances for success, conduct a\ntrial, and divest the asset. When divesting assets, the transaction may involve a combination of upfront payments, milestone payments based on clinical success, and royalties\non sales of the product.\nOur Products\nProduct/Platform Description Target Market/Indications\nbfLEAP™ – AI/ML platform for AI/ML analytics platform derived from technology developed at Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and other\nanalysis of preclinical and/or JHU-APL and licensed by the Company. organizations.\nclinical data\nsiRNA siRNA targeting Beta2-spectrin in the treatment of human diseases Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), treatment of obesity, non-\ndeveloped at George Washington University licensed by the alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Has begun the process of clinical testing but has not\nHopkins University and licensed by the Company received regulatory approval for commercialization.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from George Washington University (GWU) for rights to use siRNA targeting\nBeta2-spectrin in the treatment of human diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The license covers methods claimed in three U.S. and worldwide patent\napplications, and also includes use of this approach for treatment of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This program is currently in the\npreclinical stage of development. The Company recently initiated proof-of-concept studies on this asset and will use the outcome of these studies to inform a clinical\ndevelopment plan that would include initiation of IND-enabling studies.\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, which until recently was called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD) is a condition in which excess\nlipids, or fat, build up in the liver. This condition, which is more common in people who have obesity and related metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes, affects as many\nas 24% of adults in the US and is associated with risk of progression to more serious conditions, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), with\nassociated liver inflammation and fibrosis, and HCC. Evidence in animal models of obesity suggest that a protein called β2-spectrin may play a key role in lipid accumulation,\ntissue fibrosis, and liver damage, and targeting expression or activity of this protein may be a useful approach in treating MASH and liver cancer (Rao et al., 2021).\n5\nIn February 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for the use of an improved formulation of\nMebendazole for the treatment of any human cancer or neoplastic disease. This formulation shows potent activity in animal models of different types of cancer and has been\nevaluated in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with high-grade glioma (NCT01729260). The trial, an open-label dose-escalation study, assessed the safety of the improved\nformulation with adjuvant temozolomide in 24 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas. Investigators observed no dose-limiting toxicity in patients receiving all but the highest\ntested dose (200mg/kg/day). Four of the 15 patients receiving the maximum tested dose of 200mg/kg/day experienced dose-limiting toxicity, all of which were reversed by\ndecreasing or eliminating the dose given. There were no serious adverse events attributed to mebendazole at any dose during the trial. The Company is currently formulating a\nstrategy to find a partner to conduct additional clinical trials with this asset to enable evaluation of safety in humans.\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the Institute of Organic Chemistry and\nBiochemistry (IOCB) of the Czech Academy of Sciences for rights to commercialize N-substituted prodrugs of mebendazole that demonstrate improved solubility and\nbioavailability. The license covers prodrug compositions and use for treating disease as claimed in multiple US and worldwide patent applications. Patents have since been\nissued in the United States and Australia and are still in the prosecution phase in other territories. In September 2023 the Company announced results from a preclinical study\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of BF-223, a compound chosen from this class, in an animal model for glioblastoma. The Company is currently formulating a strategy for\ninitiating IND-enabling studies on BF-223 and is conducting outreach to identify partners that may want to license or partner in the development of BF-223.\nOur bfLEAP™ Analytics Platform\nWe are able to pursue our drug rescue business by leveraging a powerful and proven AI/ML platform (trade name: bfLEAP™) derived from technology developed at The Johns\nHopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL). The bfLEAP™ platform is based on an exclusive, world-wide license granted by Johns Hopkins University\nApplied Physics Laboratory. The license covers three (3) issued patents, as well as a new provisional patent application, non-patent rights to proprietary libraries of algorithms\nand other trade secrets, which also includes modifications and improvements. On July 8, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license\nfrom JHU-APL for the additional technology developed to enhance the bfLEAP™ platform. The new license provides additional intellectual property rights including patents,\ncopyrights and knowhow to be utilized under the Company’s bfLEAP™ analytical AI/ML platform. Under the terms of the new License Agreement, JHU will be entitled to\neight (8%) percent of net sales for the services provided by the Company to other parties and 3% for internally development drug projects in which the JHU license was\nutilized. The new license also contains tiered sub licensing fees that start at 50% and reduce to 25% based on revenues.\nWe believe the bfLEAP™ analytics platform is a potentially disruptive tool for analysis of pre-clinical and/or clinical data sets, such as the robust pre-clinical and clinical trial\ndata sets being generated in translational R&D and clinical trial settings. The input data for bfLEAP™ can include raw data (preclinical and/or clinical readouts), categorical\ndata, sociodemographic data of patients, and various other inputs. Thus, the bfLEAP™ platform is capable of capturing the particular genetic and physical characteristics of\npatients in an unbiased manner, and contextualizing it against other disparate data sources from patients (e.g. molecular data, physiological data, etc.) for less biased and more\nmeaningful conclusions. It is also uniquely scalable - the bfLEAP™ platform is able to perform analysis on large, high-volume data sets (i.e. ‘big data’) and also able to analyze\nhighly disparate “short and wide” data as well. In terms of visualization, bfLEAP™ is able to integrate with most commonly used visualization tools for graph analytics.\nWe believe that the combination of a) scalable analytics (i.e., large data or short/wide data), b) state-of-the-art proprietary algorithms, c) unsupervised machine learning, and d)\nstreamlined data ingestion/visualization makes bfLEAP™ one of the most flexible and powerful new platforms available on the market.\nThe Company will continue to evolve and improve bfLEAP™, and some of the proceeds from this offering may be used toward that effort either in-house or with development\npartners like The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.\n6\nLieber Institute for Brain Development\nOn September 8, 2023, the Company entered a data use and technology partnership agreement (the “Partnership Agreement”) with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development\n(LIBD). The Partnership Agreement covers the right of BullFrog AI to leverage its bfLEAP™ platform to mine LIBD’s comprehensive brain data, including transcriptomic,\ngenomic, DNA methylation, cell-line, clinical, and imaging data to identify previously unrecognized relationships. The goal of the partnership is to identify previously\nunrecognized relationships between genes and pathways in the brain and the development of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, thereby facilitating the development of more\neffective treatments for diseases of the human brain. The collaboration will proceed in two stages, with the first involving unsupervised construction of graphical models to\nreveal relationships between brain diseases and genomic/biologic attributes, with the goal of identifying new biomarkers and drug targets across disorders. The second stage\nwill involve creating disease-specific models that will enable identification of genes and pathways within these respective disorders. The Partnership Agreement has a one-year\nterm of data exclusivity to complete the first stages of analyses, with a two-year extension option as performance milestones are met.,\nAs contemplated in the Partnership Agreement, on October 16, 2023, the Company and LIBD entered into a commercial agreement (the “Commercial Agreement”) that sets\nforth the key terms for commercialization of products and services developed under the Partnership Agreement. Pursuant to the Commercial Agreement, LIBD granted the\nCompany a worldwide, royalty-bearing exclusive license so long as the Company receives net sales or income from the licensing of “Licensed Products” (as defined in the\nCommercial Agreement) in the application of machine learning and/or artificial intelligence for research and development in drug development, and specifically includes\ntherapeutic products, patient selection strategies, and target identification, but excludes diagnostics and incidental uses of machine learning and/or artificial intelligence on data\nderived from research. Generally, “Licensed products” are any product or service which incorporates, results from, or is derived from LIBD’s Data (meaning finished brain-\nrelated data, including but not limited to DNA methylation, RNAseq, genomic, DNA methylation, cell-line, clinical, and imaging data, and the specified data set forth in the\nPartnership Agreement) and that the Company or its affiliate develops during the term of the Partnership Agreement, and any improvements thereof after the term of the\nPartnership Agreement, and all Licensed Products or services derived therefrom by the Company or its affiliates. Licensed Products may include, but are not limited to,\nbiomarker and target identification, target validation, mapping unmet needs, identifying genetic risk factors and predictive modeling.\nThe Company was also granted the right to sublicense, to use the deliverables under the Partnership Agreement, and LIBD’s intellectual property rights in the data, to (i) use,\nsell, distribute for sale, have distributed for sale, offer for sale, have sold, import and have imported Licensed Products and (ii) to develop, have developed, make, have made\nLicensed Products that are derived from Licensed Products developed during the term of the Partnership Agreement, and any improvements made following the term. The\nCompany is prohibited from sublicensing LIBD Data. The Company shall pay LIBD a royalty based on net sales of all Licensed Products sold by the Company and/or its\naffiliates.\nThe Commercial Agreement, generally, may be terminated at any time by either the Company or LIBD if either party defaults or breaches any material term of the agreement or\nfiles for protection under bankruptcy laws, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, appoints or suffers appointment of a receiver, trustee, or similar agent over its\nproperty.\nSummary for CATIE Schizophrenia Case Study\nThe Company worked with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development to analyze data from the landmark CATIE trials. The CATIE trials were the largest trials ever conducted\nfor anti-psychotic medications. BullFrog analyzed CATIE data from ~200 schizophrenia patients, with a library of almost 1 million genetic data points for each patient, more\nthan 200 non-genetic attributes per patient, and 4 different medications used in the trial. For each of the four medications used, bfLEAP™ analysis revealed new, previously\nunknown relationships between individual genetic variants and negative patient symptoms. The genetic loci identified represent potential druggable targets, as well as potential\nstratifying criteria for future clinical trials in schizophrenia.\nWe performed another analysis on the data using our new advanced clustering algorithms bfLEAP 2.0 but focused on one particular drug named Olanzapine. Our bfLEAP™\n2.0 analytical results identified previously unknown, multi-dimensional associations among newly identified genetic variants, drug clearance, clinical trial sites, and clinical\noutcome variables in schizophrenia patients.\n7\nFIGURE 1 – bfLEAP™ Analytical Map\nEach green node represents a different sampling of the data, and arrows point to attributes (blue nodes) which were found to be key indicators according to that sampling.\nAttribute importance is determined by how many samplings identify that attribute as an indicator (i.e., number of incoming arrows to each blue node).\nIdentification of clustered multi-variate associations (e.g., novel genetic variants, drug clearance, substance abuse) could help us 1) identify novel drug targets, 2) predict which\npatients are most likely to respond, and 3) identify modifiable factors that could contribute to better outcomes.\n8\nSummary for Cardiovascular Case Study\nThe Company worked with an international collaborator in cardiovascular devices to analyze data from an ongoing clinical trial for a new device. BullFrog analyzed data from\n~55 patients, with a library of almost 15,000 unique attributes of data for each patient. The data also included adverse events, and key demographic information. For this\ncollaborator, bfLEAP™ analysis was able to provide ground truth for the company - confirming multiple correlations and non-correlations within the data. In terms of\nactionable output, the analytical results confirmed at least two demographic co-variates for the ongoing trial, and also provided a starting point for deeper physiological and\nmolecular studies.\nOur Supply Chain and Customer Base\nWe have launched our businesses using funds from our initial public offering and through our partnerships and relationships. We have a strategic relationship with FSHD\nSociety, a leading non-governmental organization, for AI/ML analysis of clinical trial data for patients with a rare neuromuscular disorder. We also have several other\ndeveloping strategic relationships in the project design phase. The Company has executed a joint development deal for a biologics discovery phase opportunity that is directed\ntoward targeted cancer therapeutics. The Company has also obtained exclusive worldwide rights to a Phase 2 ready glioblastoma drug and a discovery phase hepatocellular\ncarcinoma drug from universities. Since we intend to conduct late-stage clinical trials with partners on rescued therapeutic assets, there will be a requirement of drug product or\nother significant services to plan and execute our clinical development programs. The success of our partnered clinical development programs will require adequate availability\nof raw materials and/or drug product for our R&D and clinical trials, and, in some cases, may also require establishment of third-party arrangements to obtain finished drug\nproduct that is manufactured appropriately under industry-standard guidelines, and packaged for clinical use or sale. Since we are a digital biopharmaceutical company, our\nclinical development programs will also require, in some cases, the establishment of third-party relationships for execution and completion of clinical trials.\nOur Market Opportunity\nOne aim of our business is to “rescue” drugs that have failed in phase 3 clinical trials by using our technology to analyze all available data with the goal of designing a precision\nmedicine clinical trial that will have a better chance of being successful. The graphic below illustrates the estimated market opportunity for these failed drugs. The top arrow\nshows the number of failed phase 3 trials for several disease categories over a 5-year period. The arrows below provide our assumptions for narrowing or discounting certain\nparameters associated with the market size calculation. The final arrow shows the math behind the $47.1B. To date, we have not penetrated the failed drug market, however; we\nare actively searching for failed drug opportunities.\n9\nIdentification of candidates with potential for rescue may be challenging and require significant resources, and once these assets are identified the Company may find it\nchallenging to license them under favorable terms in order to create value for shareholders. Subsequent development of these assets for clinical testing may require significant\neffort and resources. Ultimately, these assets must undergo rigorous clinical testing and approval by FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in other countries in order to be\nmarketed. A key part of our strategy is to partner our R&D programs. In addition, we do not intend on commercializing drugs and instead will seek to divest each drug asset to a\ncompany that will commercialize the drug. The Company may receive future royalties in come transactions.\nThe following graphic illustrates the global revenue forecast for applying AI in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the increase in anticipated market spend and annual\ngrowth rate for AI solutions per certain application areas.\n10\nIntellectual Property\nPatents\nWe have exclusive worldwide rights to the following patents related to our intellectual property:\nMebendazole Polymorph For Treatment And Prevention Of Tumors\nSerial Number Country Status Issue Date Expiration Date\n62/112,706 United States Converted N/A N/A\nPCT/US2016/016968 PCT Nationalized N/A N/A\n11,110,079 United States Granted 9/7/2021 2/8/2036\n17/402,131 United States Abandoned N/A N/A\n18/525,209 United States Pending N/A N/A\n16747414.7 Europe Granted 12/15/2021 2/8/2036\n16747414.7 Czech Republic Granted 12/15/2021 2/8/2036\n16747414.7 France Granted 12/15/2021 2/8/2036\n60 2016 067 384.3 Germany Granted 12/15/2021 2/8/2036\n16747414.7 Ireland Granted 12/15/2021 2/8/2036\n502022000018341 Italy Granted 12/15/2021 2/8/2036\n16747414.7 Spain Granted 12/15/2021 2/8/2036\n16747414.7 Switzerland Granted 12/15/2021 2/8/2036\n16747414.7 United Kingdom Granted 12/15/2021 2/8/2036\n253854 Israel Granted 6/26/2021 2/8/2036\n2016800144274 China Granted 6/25/2021 2/8/2036\n201717028684 India Granted 12/1/2020 2/8/2036\n2017-541687 Japan Granted 11/18/2020 2/8/2036\nMebendazole Prodrugs with Enhanced Solubility and Oral Bioavailability\nSerial Number Country Status Issue Date Expiration Date\n62/627,810 United States Converted N/A N/A\nPCT/US2019/017291 PCT Nationalized N/A N/A\n11,712,435 United States Granted 8/1/2023 2/8/2039\n2019216757 Australia Granted 1/4/2024 2/8/2039\n19751700.6 Europe Pending N/A N/A\n3,090,691 Canada Pending N/A N/A\nInhibition of SPTBN1 to treat Obesity/NASH and Obesity/NASH-driven cancer\nSerial Number Country Status Filing Date Expiration Date\n63/113,745 United States Converted 11/13/2020 N/A\n63/147,141 United States Converted 2/8/2021 N/A\nPCT/US2021/059245 United States Nationalized 11/12/2021 N/A\n2023-528428 Japan Filed 11/12/2021 N/A\n18/252,771 United States Filed 5/12/2023 N/A\n21892928.9 Europe Filed 6/13/2023 N/A\n2021800763877 Canada Filed 11/12/2021 N/A\n11\nJohn Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab Licensed Intellectual Property:\nExpiration\nTitle Serial Number File Date Country Status Date Assignee\nApparatus and Method for Distributed Graph Processing U.S. Patent\n7/13/2015 US Granted 3/2/2037 The Johns Hopkins University\n10,146,801\nMethod and Apparatus for Analysis and Classification of High U.S. Patent\n10/5/2017 US Granted 9/25/2038 The Johns Hopkins University\nDimensional Data Sets 10,936,965\nGeneralized Low Entropy Mixture Model U.S. Patent\n4/2/2018 US Granted 12/15/2038 The Johns Hopkins University\n10,839,256\nLicenses\nWe hold the following licenses related to our intellectual property:\nLicensor Licensee Description of Rights Granted\nJohns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab BullFrog AI, Inc.

The license covers three (3) issued\npatents, one (1) new provisional patent application, non-patent rights to proprietary libraries of algorithms and other trade secrets, the license also includes modifications and\nimprovements. In October of 2021, the Company executed an amendment to the original license which represents improvements and new advanced analytics capabilities. In\nconsideration of the rights granted to the Company under the License Agreement JHU received a warrant equal to five percent (5%) of the then fully diluted equity base of the\nCompany, which shall be diluted following the closing of the IPO. Under the terms of the License Agreement, JHU will be entitled to eight percent (8%) royalty on net sales for\nthe services provided by the Company in which the JHU licensed technology was utilized, as well as fifty percent (50%) of all sublicense revenues received by the Company. In\naddition, the Company is required to pay JHU an annual maintenance fee of $1,500. Minimum annual royalty payments are $20,000 for 2022, $80,000 for 2023, and $300,000\nfor 2024 and beyond, if cumulative annual royalty payments do not reach these levels, the amount due to JHU to reach the annual minimum is due by January 31st of the\nfollowing year. Failure to make annual royalty payments is considered a material breach under the agreement and upon notice from JHU of a material breach, the Company\nshall have 60 days to cure the material breach.\nOn July 8, 2022, the company entered into an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL for the additional technology developed to enhance the bfLEAP™\nplatform. The new license provides additional intellectual property rights including patents, copyrights, and knowhow to be utilized under the Company’s bfLEAP™ analytical\nAI/ML platform. This license supersedes the previous license. In consideration of the new license, the Company issued 39,879 shares of common stock. Under the terms of the\nnew License Agreement, JHU will be entitled to eight percent (8%) of net sales for the services provided by the Company to other parties and three percent (3%) for internally\ndevelopment drug projects in which the JHU license was utilized. The new license also contains tiered sub licensing fees that start at 50% and reduce to 25% based on\nrevenues. In addition, the Company is required to pay JHU an annual maintenance fee of $1,500. Minimum annual payments are set to be $30,000 for 2022, $80,000 for 2023,\nand $300,000 for 2024 and beyond, all of which are creditable by royalties. The financial terms of the new license agreement replace the original terms and are not duplicative.\n12\nOn May 31, 2023, the Company and JHU-APL entered into Amendment number 1 of the July 8, 2022 License Agreement whereby the Company gained access to certain\nimprovements including additional patents and knowhow in exchange for a series of payments totaling $275,000. The first of these payments for $75,000 was due in July 2023\nfollowed by payments of $75,000, $75,000, and $50,000 in years 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. The amendment also reduced the 2023 minimum annual royalty payment\nto $60,000, all other financial terms remain the same. As of December 31, 2023, we have accrued $60,000 of the 2023 minimum annual royalty payments.\nGeorge Washington University - Beta2-spectrin siRNA License\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from GWU for rights to use siRNA targeting Beta2-spectrin in the treatment\nof human diseases, including HCC. The license covers methods claimed in three US and worldwide patent applications, and also includes use of this approach for treatment of\nobesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This program is currently in the preclinical stage of development. The Company has not yet initiated\ndevelopment activities or IND-enabling studies on this asset; however, the plan is to conduct this work over the next 24 months. All R&D to date on this candidate has been\nconducted by the licensor of the technology, George Washington University. The term of the agreement began on January 14, 2022 and ends on the expiration date of the last\npatent to expire or 10 years after the first sale of a licensed product if no patents have been issued. The license can be terminated by the licensee upon 60 days’ written notice, or\nby the licensor if the Company is more than 30 days late in paying amounts owed to the licensor and does not make payment upon demand, or in the event of any material\nbreach of the license that is not cured within 45 days.\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which excess lipids, or fat, build up in the liver. This condition, which is more common in people who have obesity\nand related metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes, affects as many as 24% of adults in the US and is associated with risk of progression to more serious conditions,\nincluding non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with associated liver inflammation and fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Evidence in animal models of obesity\nsuggest that a protein called β2-spectrin may play a key role in lipid accumulation, tissue fibrosis, and liver damage, and targeting expression or activity of this protein may be a\nuseful approach in treating NASH and liver cancer (Rao et al., 2021).\nIn consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the license agreement, GWU received a $20,000 License Initiation Fee. Under the terms of the License Agreement,\nGWU will be entitled to a three percent (3%) royalty on net sales subject to quarterly minimums once the first sale has occurred subsequent to regulatory approval, as well\nsublicense or assignment fees in the event the Company sublicenses or assigns their rights to use the technology. The Company will also reimburse GWU for previously\nincurred and ongoing patent costs. The Sublicense and Assignment fee amounts decline as the Company advances the clinical development of the licensed technology. The\nlicense agreement also contains milestone payments for clinical development through the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) and commercialization.\nAggregate payments made to GWU to date include the $20,000 License Initiation Fee and an additional $6,550 to reimburse the licensor for past patent costs. Aggregate future\nmilestone costs could reach $860,000 if the drug successfully completes clinical trials and is the subject of an NDA to the U.S. FDA. Future milestones on sales revenue are\nlimited to $1 million on the first $20 million in net sales.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there has been no accrual for royalties since we have not begun to generate applicable revenue. The Company assessed whether the license\nshould be capitalized and determined that the licensed program is in the early stage and therefore may not be recoverable; the Company expensed the license fee and will\nexpense development costs until commercial viability is likely.\n13\nJohns Hopkins University – Mebendazole License\nOn February 22, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU for the use of an improved formulation of Mebendazole for the\ntreatment of any human cancer or neoplastic disease. This formulation shows potent activity in animal models of different types of cancer, and has been evaluated in a Phase I\nclinical trial in patients with high-grade glioma (NCT01729260). The trial, an open-label dose-escalation study, assessed the safety of the improved formulation with adjuvant\ntemozolomide in 24 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas. Investigators observed no dose-limiting toxicity in patients receiving all but the highest tested dose\n(200mg/kg/day). Four of the 15 patients receiving the maximum tested dose of 200mg/kg/day experienced dose-limiting toxicity, all of which were reversed by decreasing or\neliminating the dose given. There were no serious adverse events attributed to mebendazole at any dose during the trial. The Company is currently formulating a strategy to\nconduct additional clinical trials with this asset to enable evaluation of safety in humans.\nThe license covers six (6) issued patents and one (1) pending application, with the term of the agreement beginning on February 22, 2022 and ending on the date of expiration\nof the last to expire patent. The license can be terminated by the licensee upon 90 days’ written notice, or by the licensor in the event of any material breach of the license that is\nnot cured within 30 days. In consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the license agreement, JHU will receive a staggered Upfront License Fee of $250,000,\nwith the first $50,000 payment due within 30 days of the effective date. The Company will also reimburse JHU for previously incurred and ongoing patent costs. Under the\nterms of the license agreement, JHU will be entitled to three- and one-half percent (3.5%) royalty on net sales by the Company. In addition, the Company is required to pay\nJHU minimum annual royalty payments of $5,000 for 2023, $10,000 for 2024, $20,000 for 2025, $30,000 for 2026 and $50,000 for 2027 and each year after until the first\ncommercial sale after which the annual minimum royalty shall be $250,000. The license agreement also contains milestone payments for clinical development steps through the\napproval of an NDA and commercialization. Aggregate payments made to date include the initial $50,000 upfront fee and an additional $79,232 to reimburse the licensor for\npast patent costs. Aggregate future milestone costs could reach $1,500,000 if the drug successfully completes Phase II and III clinical trials and is approved for sale and\nmarketing by the US FDA. Future milestones on sales revenue are $1 million on the first $20 million in sales revenue, $2 million in the first-year cumulative sales revenue\nexceeds $100 million, $10 million in the first-year cumulative sales revenue exceeds $500 million, and $20 million in the first-year cumulative sales revenue exceeds $1 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balance of accrued expense related to this license agreement was $10,000 and $242,671, respectively. The Company assessed whether\nthe license should be capitalized and determined that the licensed program is in the early stage and therefore may not be recoverable; the Company expensed the license fee and\nwill expense development costs until commercial viability is likely.\nJohns Hopkins University – Mebendazole Prodrug License\nOn October 13, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU and the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (IOCB)\nof the Czech Academy of Sciences for rights to commercialize N-substituted prodrugs of mebendazole that demonstrate improved solubility and bioavailability. The license\ncovers prodrug compositions and use for treating disease as claimed in multiple US and worldwide patent applications. The term of the agreement began on October 13, 2022\nand continues until the date of expiration of the last to expire patent, or for 20 years from the effective date of the agreement if no patents are issued. The license can be\nterminated by the Company upon 90 days’ written notice, or by the licensor in the event of any material breach of the license that is not cured by the Company within 30 days.\n14\nIn consideration for the rights granted to the Company under the License Agreement JHU and IOCB will receive a staggered upfront license fee of $100,000. The Company\nwill also reimburse JHU and IOCB for previously incurred patent costs totaling $33,265 and will be responsible for reimbursing licensors for future patent costs. Under the\nterms of the License Agreement, the licensors will be entitled to a four percent (4%) royalty on net sales subject to annual minimums upon first commercial sale of a licensed\nproduct, as well sublicense or assignment fees in the event the Company sublicenses or assigns their rights to use the technology. The Sublicense fee amount declines as the\nCompany advances the clinical development of licensed technology. The Company is required to pay minimum annual royalties (MAR) beginning in year 4 of the agreement.\nThe MAR for year 4 will be $5,000, increasing to $10,000 in year 5, $20,000 in year 6, $30,000 in year 7, and $50,000 in year 8 and subsequent years. The Company will be\nresponsible for milestone payments for patent issuance of up to $50,000 and clinical development milestones up to and including approval of an NDA totaling up to $2.3\nmillion. The Company will be required to pay a commercial milestone of $1 million once sales reach $20 million in the US, $2 million when sales in the US reach $100\nmillion, $10 million when US sales reach $500 million, and $20 million when US sales exceed $1 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balance of accrued expense related to this license agreement was $0 and $133,238, respectively. The Company assessed whether the\nlicense should be capitalized and determined that the licensed program is in the early stage and therefore may not be recoverable; the Company expensed the license fee and\nwill expense development costs until commercial viability is likely.\nOn September 26, 2023, the Company announced positive data in a preclinical study investigating the anti-cancer activity of a novel prodrug of mebendazole for the treatment\nof glioblastoma. The study assessed the relative efficacy of BF-222, a novel formulation of mebendazole that has been evaluated in clinical trials, and BF-223, a novel prodrug\nof mebendazole with improved solubility and bioavailability relative to BF-222, compared with placebo in mice that had been implanted with tumor cells as a model for human\nglioblastoma. Animals treated with BF-223 had an average survival time of 27.9 days compared with 27.3 days for mice treated with BF-222 and 23.4 days for mice given\nplacebo. Mice treated with BF-223 were administered 80% of the dose that mice treated with BF-222 received, and improved outcomes for both treatment groups were\nstatistically significant compared to placebo. In addition, animals treated with equivalent doses of BF-222 and BF-223 showed comparable and significant reduction in tumor\ngrowth compared to control animals during the study.\nCompetition\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The\nimmuno-oncology, neuroscience, and rare disease segments of the industry in particular are highly competitive. While we believe that our technology, development experience\nand scientific knowledge provide competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty\npharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.\nMany of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, conducting clinical\ntrials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries\nmay result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified\nscientific and management personnel and in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or\nnecessary for our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and\nestablished companies.\n15\nThe key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of\ncompanion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, if any, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other\nthird-party payors.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, are more effective, have fewer or less\nsevere side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any medicines we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their\nmedicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the\nmarket. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines. There are\nmany generic medicines currently on the market for certain of the indications that we are pursuing, and additional generics are expected to become available over the coming\nyears. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic medicines.\nAny product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. If the\nproduct candidates of our priority programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they will compete with the drugs discussed\nbelow and will likely compete with other drugs currently in development.\nbfLEAP\nThe analytics industry and application of AI in healthcare is growing rapidly. Competition exists along the entire continuum of the drug development process from discovery to\ncommercialization and beyond. We believe the weakness of the industry is the quality of the data and we believe bfLEAP provides several competitive advantages, that will\nposition the Company for success, First, bfLEAP is highly scalable and can process data from small to extremely large complex data sets without the need for additional code\nbeing developed. Second, it is adept at processing and analyzing incomplete data and making predictions that we do not believe other technologies are capable of doing. Finally,\nbfLEAP has the ability to extract the most important features for analysis out of extremely large complex data sets using unsupervised machine learning algorithms, thereby\ngreatly simplifying complex problems. Since data quality is a problem that exists in the healthcare industry, we see these as major differentiators. The ability to make\npredictions, find relationships and patterns and anomalies in extremely large complex data sets has been demonstrated by the Applied Physics Lab in other applications and\nsectors. Finally, the algorithms used by bfLEAP are proprietary and protected, having been developed at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. We believe most of the\ncompetitors rely on open-source algorithms and we also believe that we have already demonstrated our superiority via the August 2021 publication in DeepAI.org.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe FDA does not currently require approval of AI technologies used to aid in therapeutics, but that could change in the future. The FDA will regulate any clinical trials\nconducted by the Company.\nOur clinical development programs will, in some cases, require regulatory review of preclinical and/or clinical data by the FDA or other governing agencies, and subsequent\ncompliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The results of the clinical trials that we conduct will be evaluated by the FDA and other\nregulatory bodies. The comments and approvals that are obtained are expected to lead to milestone payments under the collaborative agreement. Accordingly, our ability to\nnavigate the regulatory process is extremely important to the success of the Company. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in this process due to primarily\nfocusing on drug candidates that already have some level of success in clinical trials. Previous success of a particular candidate in trials combined with our precision medicine\napproach to clinical trial design using our bfLEAP platform, will de-risk the development process and improve the chances for success.\n16\nGovernment Regulation and Product Approval\nGovernment authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research,\ndevelopment, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval\nmonitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and\njurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and\nfinancial resources.\nFDA Approval Process\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other federal and\nstate statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing,\ndistribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may\nsubject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (NDAs), warning or untitled letters,\nproduct recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nPharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the\nsubmission to FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled\nclinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements\ntypically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.\nPreclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and\nefficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of\npreclinical testing are submitted to FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a\nproposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day\nwaiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND\nwithin this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or\npatients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical\npractice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as\nwell as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol\ninvolving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND.\n17\nClinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the\ndrug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses,\nand, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular\nindication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable\nsafety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically\nat geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of\nthe drug. In most cases, FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other\nconfirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, such as where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very\npersuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the\nresult in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.\nAfter completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin\nin the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry,\nmanufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user\nfee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription product. These fees are typically increased annually. Sponsors of\napplications for drugs granted Orphan Drug Designation are exempt from these user fees.\nFDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee – typically a\npanel that includes clinicians and other experts – for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. FDA is not bound by the\nrecommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.\nBefore approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at\nwhich the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) is satisfactory and the NDA contains\ndata that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.\nFast Track Designation\nFDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which\nthere is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug\ncandidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate.\nFDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.\nIf a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, and FDA may review sections of the NDA before the\napplication is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the\napplicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. While we may\nseek Fast Track Designation, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining any such designation. Even if we do obtain such designation, we may not experience a\nfaster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. A Fast Track Designation does not ensure that the product candidate will receive\nmarketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the\ndesignation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.\n18\nPost-Approval Requirements\nOnce an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of\ndrugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional\nactivities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.\nAdverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4\ntesting, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the\nproduct. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain\nof their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced\ninspections by FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time,\nmoney, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request\nproduct recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are\nsubsequently discovered.\nGeneric Competition\nIn seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug,\neach of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known\nas the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application\n(ANDA). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown\nthrough bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to\nconduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as\n“generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.\nThe ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify\nthat (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval\nis sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product (a Paragraph IV certification). The ANDA applicant may also\nelect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than\ncertify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or certifies that the listed patents will not be infringed by the new product, the\nANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV\ncertification, the NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of\na such certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in\nthe infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.\nExclusivity\nUpon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE) that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a\ngeneric version of that drug. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the\nOrange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Certain changes to a drug, such as\nthe addition of a new indication to the package insert, can be the subject of a three-year period of exclusivity if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations\n(other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to approval of the application. FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug\nthat includes the change during the period of exclusivity.\n19\nPatent Term Extension\nAfter NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s\ntesting phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five\nyears). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14\nyears, and only one patent can be extended. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim\npatent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is\nreduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension\nis being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.\nOther Healthcare Laws\nIn the United States, biotechnology company activities are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited\nto, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General and the\nOffice for Civil Rights), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, research,\nsales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal false claims laws, the\nprivacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.\nAlso, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states,\napply regardless of the payor.\nData privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which business is conducted may also be applicable. HIPAA, as amended by the Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and\ntransmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically\nauthorized situations and requires covered entities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form. Among other things,\nHITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected\nhealth information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to\nmake civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in\nfederal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and\nsecurity of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating\ncompliance efforts.\nInsurance Coverage and Reimbursement\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of\nany product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from\nthird-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers,\nprivate health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for\ndetermining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug\nproduct. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of FDA-approved drugs for a particular\nindication. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, coverage and\nreimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that\nwill require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will\nbe applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\n20\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of February 10, 2023, the Company has 4 full-time employees and consultants, including its Chief Executive Officer Vininder Singh and its Chief Financial Officer, Dane\nSaglio and 7 part-time employees, advisors, and consultants. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with\nour employees is good. We also engage consultants on an as-needed basis to supplement existing staff.\nProperties\nCurrently, the Company does not own any real property.

(“Bullfrog”) as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements that are\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report. References in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to “us”, “we”, “our”\nand similar terms refer to the Company. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains statements that are forward-\nlooking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors. These statements are often identified by\nthe use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “estimate,” or “continue,” and similar expressions or variations. Actual results\ncould differ materially because of the factors discussed in “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report, and other factors that we may not know.\nOVERVIEW\nBullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 6, 2020. Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. is the parent company of Bullfrog AI, Inc. and Bullfrog AI\nManagement, LLC, which were incorporated in Delaware and Maryland, in 2017 and 2021, respectively. Operations are currently conducted through BullFrog AI Holdings,\nInc., which began operations on February 6, 2020. We are a company focused specifically on advanced Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) analysis of complex\ndata in the advancement of medicine. Our AI/ML platform (trade name: bfLEAP™) was created from technology originally developed at The Johns Hopkins University\nApplied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL).\nIn February 2018, BullFrog AI Holdings secured the original exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL for the technology. The license covers three (3)\nissued patents, one (1) new provisional patent application, non-patent rights to proprietary libraries of algorithms and other trade secrets including modifications and\nimprovements. We entered into a license agreement in July 2022 that provides the Company with new intellectual property and also encompasses most of the intellectual\nproperty from the February 2018 license. Our objective is to utilize our for a precision medicine approach toward drug development with biopharmaceutical collaborators, as\nwell as our own internal clinical development programs. We believe the bfLEAP™ platform is ideally suited for evaluating pre-clinical and clinical trial data generated in\ntranslational research and clinical trial settings that lead to faster, less expensive drug approvals.\nOur aim is to improve the odds of success in each stage of developing medicine, ranging from early pre-clinical through late-stage clinical development. Our ultimate objective\nis to utilize bfLEAP™ to enable the success of ongoing clinical trials or rescue late-stage failed drugs (i.e., Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial failures) for development and\ndivestiture; although, we will also consider collaborations for earlier stage drugs. We hope to accomplish this through strategic acquisitions of current clinical stage and failed\ndrugs for in-house development, or through strategic partnerships with biopharmaceutical industry companies.\n24\nOn July 8, 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL for the additional technology. The new license provides additional\nintellectual property rights including patents, copyrights, and knowhow to be utilized under the Company’s bfLEAP™ analytical AI/ML platform. In consideration of the new\nlicense, the Company issued to JHU-APL 39,879 shares of common stock. In September 2020 and October of 2021, the Company executed amendments to the original license\nwhich represents improvements and new advanced analytics capabilities. In consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the original License Agreement, the\nCompany granted JHU 178,571 warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock at $2.10 per share. Under the terms of the new License Agreement, JHU will be\nentitled to eight (8%) percent of net sales for the services provided by the Company to other parties and 3% for internally developed drug projects in which the JHU license was\nutilized. The new license also contains tiered sub licensing fees that start at 50% and reduce to 25% based on revenues. On May 31, 2023, the Company and JHU-APL entered\ninto Amendment number 1 of the July 8, 2022 License Agreement whereby the Company gained access to certain improvements including additional patents and knowhow in\nexchange for a series of payments totaling $275,000. The first of these payments for $75,000 was due in July 2023 followed by annual payments of $75,000, $75,000 and\n$50,000 in years 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. The amendment also reduced the 2023 minimum annual royalty payment to $60,000, all other financial terms remain the\nsame. As a result of this Amendment, the minimum annual payments are set to be $30,000 for 2022, $60,000 for 2023, and $300,000 for 2024 and beyond, all of which are\ncreditable by royalties.\nWe intend to continue to evolve and improve bfLEAP™, either in-house or with development partners like JHU-APL. We plan to leverage our proprietary AI/ML platform\ndeveloped over several years at one of the top innovation institutions in the world which has already been successfully applied in multiple sectors.\nWe have staffed our business using funds from our initial public offering and have entered into partnerships and relationships and recently completed our first commercial\nservice contract with a leading rare disease non-profit organization for AI/ML analysis of late-stage clinical data. We have also acquired the rights to a series of preclinical and\nearly clinical drug assets from universities, as well as a strategic collaboration with a world-renowned research institution to create a HSV1 viral therapeutic platform to\nengineer immunotherapies for a variety of diseases. We have signed exclusive worldwide License Agreements with JHU for a cancer drug that targets glioblastoma (brain\ncancer), pancreatic cancer, and others. We have also signed an exclusive worldwide license from George Washington University for another cancer drug that targets\nhepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) and other liver diseases. Additionally, we intend to gain access to later-stage clinical assets through partnerships or the acquisition of\nrights to failed therapeutic candidates for drug rescue. In certain circumstances, we intend to conduct late-stage clinical trials in an effort to rescue therapeutic assets that\npreviously failed. In these cases, there will be a requirement for drug supply and regulatory services to conduct clinical trials. The success of our clinical development programs\nwill require finding partners to support the clinical development, adequate availability of raw materials and/or drug product for our R&D and clinical trials, and, in some cases,\nmay also require establishment of third-party arrangements to obtain finished drug product that is manufactured appropriately under (GMP) industry-standard guidelines, and\npackaged for clinical use or sale. Since we are a company focused on using our AI technology to advance medicines, any clinical development programs will also require, in all\ncases, partners and the establishment of third-party relationships for execution and completion of clinical trials.\nSince completing our IPO on February 14, 2023, aided by the receipt of the IPO proceeds, we have initiated several initiatives: Investor relations and marketing to promote and\nraise awareness of the company in the financial and business sectors, research and development, collaboration with J Craig Venter Institute and in the quarter ended September\n30, 2023, completed a preclinical study for our Mebendazole prodrug program. The Company is actively engaged in developing and seeking out new intellectual property as it\nstrives to continuously evolve its AI/ML platform. Additionally, the Company has engaged a business development firm specializing in the biopharmaceutical industry to seek\nand secure a strategic development partner for our Mebendazole program.\n25\nInternally, the Company has added incremental staff to accelerate execution, and the development of processes and custom scripts for use in performing analytical services for\ncustomers, while also launching initiatives targeting large public health data sources and seeking access to proprietary health data sources. We also transitioned our accounting\nand financial reporting systems and processes to enhance our internal control environment as a public company. Capital from the IPO was also used to retire two notes that\nwere sold to fund the Company through the IPO that did not convert into common stock as well as other debts accrued over time to our staff, employees and consultants as well\nas obligations related to the acquisition of our licensed drug programs.\nIn February 2024 the Company received net proceeds of approximately $4.9 million dollars from an underwritten public offering of 1,507,139 shares of common stock (or pre-\nfunded warrants in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants to purchase 1,507,139 shares of common stock at an offering price of $3.782. The 5 year warrants have an exercise\nprice of $4.16. On February 21, 2024, the underwriters elected to exercise the over-allotment option for the purchase of an additional 218,382 shares of common stock, and the\nCompany received additional net proceeds of approximately $750,000, pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment. In the absence of significant revenues in 2024 the\nCompany believes that its capital resources are sufficient to fund planned operations for more than 12 months from the date of this filing.\nOur Strategy\nThe Company has a unique strategy designed to reduce risk and increase the frequency of cash flow. The first part of the strategy is to generate revenues through strategic\nrelationships with biopharma companies. These relationships will be structured as a combination of fees and intellectual property based on the specific scope of the\nengagement. The objective of these engagements will be to uncover valuable insights to reduce the risk and/or increase the speed of the drug development process which can be\nachieved through manual or automated integration into the client’s workflow or analysis of discrete data sets.\nIn the future, the second part of our strategy involves acquiring the rights to clinical stage drugs, using our bfLEAP technology to design a precision medicine trial, conduct the\ntrial with a partner, and sell the asset. This approach may also apply to earlier phases in the drug development process such as discovery and preclinical. In any case, the\nobjective is to create near term value and exit and monetize as quickly as possible, preferably within approximately 30 months.\nResults of Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nRevenue and Costs of Goods Sold\nWe recognized $65,000 and $10,000 in revenue and $5,200 and $800 in costs of goods sold during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nYear ended December 31, Net Change\n2023 2022\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 1,432,614 $ 609,270 $ 823,344\nGeneral and administrative 3,994,710 1,855,731 2,138,979\nTotal operating expenses $ 5,427,324 $ 2,465,001 $ 2,962,323\n26\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $823,344 compared to the same period ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to\nthe inclusion of the cost of salaries and consulting fees in 2023 as we initiated our collaboration with J Craig Venter Institute and completion of a preclinical study for our\nMebendazole prodrug program, as well as the cost of acquiring access to additional technology from JHU-APL related to bfLEAP™ pursuant to Amendment 1 of the July 2022\nLicense Agreement. In 2022, the majority of the research and development expenses were directly related to the acquisition of two drug development product candidates\nincluding Mebendazole.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $2,138,979, compared to the same period ended December 31, 2022, primarily\ndue to higher salary and consulting costs reflecting an increased level of service as well the initiation of investor relations and marketing efforts and the transition of our\naccounting and financial reporting process to support a public company. The 2023 period also reflects approximately $120,000 in recruiting fees related to staff additions.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest expense decreased $268,056 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period ended December 31, 2022 due to the majority of our debt converting\nor being paid off in the first quarter of 2023. The loss on the conversion of notes of $92,959 for the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to the conversion of the convertible\nnotes. Other income increased by $183,244 due to interest earned on our IPO proceeds which we hold in an overnight sweep account.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn 2022, the Company received net proceeds from the sale of Convertible Bridge Notes of approximately $1,016,000 and repaid the unsecured promissory notes sold in 2021 in\nthe amount of $49,000. The Company sold one additional promissory note and received net proceeds of $100,000 in January 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used approximately $911,000 on operating activities versus approximately $382,000 for the same period in 2021. The\n2022 cash use included approximately $548,000 in salaries, approximately $634,000 in consulting and professional fees including legal, accounting and auditing fees, as well as\nconsulting fees for operational activities and approximately $609,000 in technology license fees, patent cost reimbursements and minimum annual royalties which has been\nrecorded as a research & development expense.\nThrough December 31, 2023, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $9,755,000 and funded its operations through the sale of common stock and debt. We\nanticipate that our expenses will increase in the future to support our service offerings, clinical and pre-clinical research and development activities associated with strategic\npartnering and collaborations, as well as acquired product candidates and the increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases could include increased costs\nrelated to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we anticipate increased costs\nassociated with being a public company including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange\nCommission requirements, insurance, and investor relations costs.\nThe Company’s current operations include BullFrog AI, Inc. and BullFrog Management, LLC, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc., which is a\nholding company that depends upon the sale of its securities and cash generated through its subsidiaries to fund consolidated operations.\n27\nOn February 16, 2023, the Company completed its IPO of 1,297,318 units (each, a “Unit,” collectively, the “Units”) at a price of $6.50 per unit for a total of approximately $8.4\nmillion of gross proceeds to the Company. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, one tradeable warrant (each, a “Tradeable Warrant,” collectively,\nthe “Tradeable Warrants”) to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.80 per share, and one non-tradeable warrant (each, a “Non-tradeable Warrant,”\ncollectively, the “Non-tradeable Warrants”; together with the Tradeable Warrants, each, a “Warrant,” collectively, the “Warrants”) to purchase one share of the Company’s\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $8.125. In connection with the IPO, the Company also completed a 1-for-7 reverse stock split of our common stock.\nIn connection with the IPO, a SAFE and convertible loan agreement held by a related party converted into 55,787 shares of post reverse split common stock. Additionally, all\noutstanding convertible bridge notes and accrued interest through November 30, 2022 were converted into 276,289 shares of common stock and 276,289 warrants to purchase\ncommon stock were issued to the Convertible Bridge Note holders at conversion. The convertible bridge note conversions and the warrant exercise pricing were determined\nusing a $25 million dollar company valuation immediately before the IPO.\nBetween April 5 and April 13, 2023, the holders of warrants exercised 436,533 warrants for common stock at various exercise prices and the Company received proceeds of\napproximately $1,495,000.\nIn the absence of revenues in 2024 management believes the company’s capital resources are sufficient to fund planned operations for substantially longer than 12 months from\nthe date of this filing.\nConsolidated Cash Flow Data\nYear ended December 31, Net Change\n2023 2022\nNet cash (used in) provided by\nResearch and development Operating activities $ (6,001,299) $ (910,890) $ (5,090,409)\nGeneral and administrative Investing activities - (8,744) 8,744\nFinancing activities 8,568,359 967,290 7,601,069\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,567,060 $ 47,656 $ 2,519,404\nCash Flows Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $5,090,409 compared to the same period ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to\npaying down accrued expenses for technology access, consultants, and compensation in 2023, coupled with increased operating costs, including D&O insurance premiums.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nThere was no cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $7,601,069, compared to the same period ended December 31, 2022 primarily due\nto the completion of our Initial Public Offering in February 2023 and proceeds received pursuant to warrant exercises.\n28\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn Footnote 2 of our Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 found elsewhere in this filing, we included a discussion of the most critical accounting\npolicies used in the preparation of our financial statements. There has been no material change in the policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements\nsince the completion of the 2023 audit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWhile we generated our first revenues in late 2022 from our services provided to a pharmaceutical customer, in the third quarter of 2023 we completed our first commercial\nservice contract and recognized revenue in the amount of $65,000. We have service contracts with two organizations and currently have multiple discussions underway,\nalthough there can be no assurance of entering into additional service agreements and business relationships in 2024.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into two categories: research and development and general and administrative. Prior to 2022, most of our activities were related to:\ntechnology evaluation, acquisition and validation, capital acquisition and business development activities in general, which we believe have readied the Company for contract\nservices while exploring strategic partnering and asset acquisition. These activities and related expenditures have been recorded and reported as General and Administrative in\nour Financial Statements. In 2022, we licensed two drug development programs from universities and also entered into a new license with JHU-APL for new IP and other\nenhancements used with our bfLEAP™ platform. In 2022, we expended appropriately $608,000 on license related payments for our bfLEAP™ AI/ML platform and our two\ndrug development programs from universities. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in 2024 as we initiate activities directed towards the\ndevelopment of service offering products, collaborations (JCVI) and preclinical studies aimed at generating the data to enable the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND)\napplication.\nResearch and Development Costs and Expenses\nResearch and development costs and expenses in 2022 consisted primarily of costs related to the acquisition of licensed technology. In 2023 we have initiated development\nactivities on our licensed drug candidates and our discovery collaboration with JCVI. In addition to fees paid to external service providers, we are also allocating internal costs\nfor personnel working on these efforts in addition to personnel costs related to our internal efforts to develop our product and service offerings using bfLEAP™. We anticipate\nour research and development costs could become significant as we execute on our business plan and begin conducting preclinical research and development activities directed\nat securing development partners and filing an IND for our licensed drug development programs described in this filing, as well as under strategic partnerships and for other\ndrug development programs we may acquire. Research and development expenses are recorded in operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Estimates will be\nused in determining the expense liability of certain costs where services have been performed but not yet invoiced. We will monitor levels of performance under each\nsignificant contract for external services through communications with the service providers to reflect the actual amount expended.\n29\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIn anticipation of the IPO, a management team with deep industry experience was identified and engaged as employees and consultants to assist the Company in preparing for\nthe IPO and subsequently, to operate and function as a public company. Through 2022, the primary activities included: technology evaluation, acquisition, and validation,\ncapital acquisition and business development activities which in general, have readied the Company for contract services while exploring strategic partnering and asset\nacquisition as noted above. In February 2023, the Company achieved its objective of completing an IPO and listing on NASDAQ. Our 2023 general and administrative\nexpenses are significantly higher than our 2022 general and administrative expenses due to several factors. The primary increases in 2023 relate to new costs associated with\nbeing a public company such as D&O insurance, professional services engaged to support SEC compliance as well as higher salary and consulting expenses as we have hired\nadditional staff and consultants. We have also increased our business development, investor relations and marketing efforts. We anticipate that our general and administrative\nexpenses may increase in the future to support our service offerings, clinical and pre-clinical research and development activities associated with strategic partnering and\ncollaborations.\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status\nThe Company is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”) and may take advantage of reduced\nreporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply\nwith new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period to\ncomply with new or revised accounting standards. This may make it difficult to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either\nnot an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the\npotential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe are also a “smaller reporting company”, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates plus the aggregate amount of gross proceeds to us as a\nresult of the IPO is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller\nreporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the\nmost recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we\ncease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies.\nSpecifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nand, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a smaller reporting company, this disclosure is not required.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements required to be filed pursuant to this Item 8 are appended to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Index to Consolidated Financial\nStatements” which appears on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\n30\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe are transitioning to and will maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that\nwe file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and timely reported as provided in SEC rules and forms and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We will periodically review the design and\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, including compliance with various laws and regulations that apply to our operations. We will make modifications to\nimprove the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and may take other corrective action if our reviews identify a need for such modifications or\nactions. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we will apply judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and\nprocedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthe degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur\nand not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThis Annual Report does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting due to a transition period established by the rules\nof the SEC for newly public companies.\nAttestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting due to an\nexemption established by the JOBS Act for “emerging growth companies.”\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nITEM 9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\n31\nPART III\nITEM 10.

Diversity of experience,\nexpertise, and viewpoints is one of many factors the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers when recommending director nominees to our Board.\nFurther, our Board is committed to actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups and the LGBTQ+ community to include in the pool from\nwhich new candidates are selected. Our Board also seeks members that have experience in positions with a high degree of responsibility or are, or have been, leaders in the\ncompanies or institutions with which they are, or were, affiliated, but may seek other members with different backgrounds, based upon the contributions they can make to our\nCompany. While the Board has continued its efforts to identify candidates that have such experience, they have currently been unable to identify any such candidates which\nfulfill the diversity requirement with the requisite professional experience.\nRole of Board of Directors in Risk Oversight Process\nThe board of directors has extensive involvement in the oversight of risk management related to us and our business and accomplishes this oversight through the\nregular reporting by the Audit Committee.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nOther than as set forth below and compensation arrangements, including employment, and indemnification arrangements, discussed, there have been no transactions\nsince January 1, 2021, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or will exceed the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets as at the\nyear-end for the last two completed fiscal years, and to which any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any\nimmediate family member of, or person sharing the household with, any of these individuals, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nOn July 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), with a related party, Tivoli Trust, our second largest shareholder (the\n“Investor”), with an amount of $150,000, with 0% interest. Under the SAFE agreement, if there is an Equity Financing before the termination of this SAFE, on the initial\nclosing of such Equity Financing, this SAFE will automatically convert into the number of shares of SAFE Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the\nConversion Price, which means either: (1) the Safe Price (the price per share equal to the Post-Money Valuation Cap divided by the Company Capitalization) or (2) the\nDiscount Price (the price per share of the Standard Preferred Stock sold in the Equity Financing multiplied by the Discount Rate), whichever calculation results in a greater\nnumber of shares of Safe Preferred Stock.\nIf there is a Liquidity Event before the termination of this SAFE, this SAFE will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d)\nbelow) to receive a portion of Proceeds, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of such Liquidity Event, equal to the\ngreater of (i) the Purchase Amount (the “Cash-Out Amount”) or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by\nthe Liquidity Price (the “Conversion Amount”). If any of the Company’s securityholders are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be received in a Liquidity\nEvent, the Investor will be given the same choice, provided that the Investor may not choose to receive a form of consideration that the Investor would be ineligible to receive\nas a result of the Investor’s failure to satisfy any requirement or limitation generally applicable to the Company’s securityholders, or under any applicable laws.\nThis SAFE will automatically terminate (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this SAFE)\nimmediately following the earliest to occur of: (i) the issuance of Capital Stock to the Investor pursuant to the automatic conversion of this SAFE under agreement; or (ii) the\npayment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor pursuant to the agreement.\n40\nAs of December 31, 2021, the $150,000 received from SAFE was recorded at 6% imputed interest. The maturity date of the loan is defined by the SAFE agreement as\ndiscussed above. The SAFE was converted into 32,967 shares of common stock (post reverse stock split) upon the Company’s IPO in February 2023.\nOn August 19, 2021, the company entered into a convertible loan agreement with a related party, with a principal balance of $99,900 at 9% interest. The noteholder\nhas the right to convert the principal and interest into common shares of the Company. This loan included an original issuance discount of 5% and included 99,900 Warrants at\nan exercise price of $1, exercisable for 5 years from the issue date on the face of the Warrant. The maturity date of the loan was February 19, 2022. In May 2022, the Company\nand the note holder agreed to cancel and void previous warrants and entered into a new agreement for 115,185 warrants with an exercise price of $2.50. As of December 31,\n2022, the $99,900 principal and the $4,950 overpayment of the note remained outstanding and had accrued interest of $12,463. The warrants discussed above were initially\ndiscounted against the notes, subsequent to year end December 31, 2021, they were deemed voided and new warrants in accordance with the new terms were issued. We\nassessed the differences in fair value and determined that they were de minimis and expensed the full value of the new warrants. The noteholder elected to convert the loan into\n21,747 shares of common stock (post reverse stock split) upon the Company’s IPO in February 2023.\nOn June 15, 2021, the company entered into a unsecured short term loan agreement with the Investor for an aggregate principal balance of $34,000, with a one-year\nmaturity date, accruing interest at 5% and imputing an additional 1% interest.\nOn November 19, 2021, 2021, the company entered into an unsecured short term loan agreement with the Investor for an aggregate principal balance of $5,000, with a\none-year maturity date, accruing interest at 5% and imputing an additional 1% interest.\nOn December 13, 2021, the company entered into an unsecured short term loan agreement with the Investor for an aggregate principal balance of $10,000, with a one-\nyear maturity date, accruing interest at 5% and imputing an additional 1% interest.\nOn October 5, 2022, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with the Investor whereby all of his common stock, 734,493 shares of common stock (post\nreverse split shares), were exchanged into 73,449 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that converts to common at a rate of 10 common for one preferred. The Series\nA Preferred Stock is the economic equivalent of the common stock but has no voting rights and is subject to a blocker which prohibits the conversion into common stock if it\nwould result in the Investor owning more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock at such time. For a description of the rights and preferences of the Series A\nPreferred Stock, see “Description of Securities- Series A Convertible Preferred Stock”.\nOther Transactions\nNone.\nDirector Independence\nMessrs. Elsey, Enright and Hanson, three members of our Board of Directors, are independent using the definition of independence under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)\n(2) and the standards established by the SEC.\nPolicies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions\nFor purposes of our policy only, a related person transaction is a transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements, or\nrelationships, in which we and any related person are, were or will be participants in which the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of our\ntotal assets at year-end. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee or director are not covered by this policy. A related person is any\nexecutive officer, director, or beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, including any of their immediate family members and any entity owned or\ncontrolled by such persons.\n41\nUnder the policy, if a transaction has been identified as a related person transaction, including any transaction that was not a related person transaction when originally\nconsummated or any transaction that was not initially identified as a related person transaction prior to consummation, our management must present information regarding the\nrelated person transaction to our audit committee, or, if audit committee approval would be inappropriate, to another independent body of our Board of Directors, for review,\nconsideration and approval or ratification. The presentation must include a description of, among other things, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related\npersons, the benefits to us of the transaction and whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or from, as the case may be, an unrelated third\nparty or to or from employees generally. Under the policy, we will collect information that we deem reasonably necessary from each director, executive officer and, to the\nextent feasible, significant stockholder to enable us to identify any existing or potential related-person transactions and to effectuate the terms of the policy. In addition, under\nour code of business conduct and ethics, our employees and directors will have an affirmative responsibility to disclose any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be\nexpected to give rise to a conflict of interest. In considering related person transactions, our audit committee, or other independent body of our Board of Directors, will take into\naccount the relevant available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to:\n● the risks, costs and benefits to us;\n● the impact on a director’s independence in the event that the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director or an entity with which a director is\naffiliated;\n● the availability of other sources for comparable services or products; and\n● the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from employees generally.\nThe policy requires that, in determining whether to approve, ratify or reject a related person transaction, our audit committee, or other independent body of our Board\nof Directors, must consider, in light of known circumstances, whether the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, our best interests and those of our stockholders, as our\naudit committee, or other independent body of our Board of Directors, determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.\nItem 14.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\nfinancial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for flows for the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\nrelate.\nAs discussed in Note 2, the Company had a going concern disclosure in the previous year due to continued net losses from operations and negative cash flows in operations.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues and\nexpenses, which are difficult to substantiate.\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the removal of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information along with management’s plans to mitigate the\ngoing concern and management’s disclosure on going concern.\n/s/ M&K CPAS, PLLC\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 29, 2024\nF-2\nBULLFROG AI HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,624,730 $ 57,670\nPrepaid expenses 145,882 15,000\nTotal current assets 2,770,612 72,670\nProperty and equipment, net 5,974 7,699\nTotal assets $ 2,776,586 $ 80,369\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 103,656 $ 543,993\nAccrued expenses 80,694 982,988\nDeferred revenue -

Organization and Nature of Business\nDescription of Business\nBullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. (“we”, “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 6, 2020. Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. is the parent company of\nBullfrog AI, Inc. and Bullfrog AI Management, LLC which were incorporated in Delaware and Maryland, in 2017 and 2021, respectively. All of our operations are currently\nconducted through BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc., which began operations on February 6, 2020. We are a company focused specifically on advanced AI/ML-driven analysis of\ncomplex data sets in medicine and healthcare. Our objective is to utilize our platform for precision medicine approach to drug asset enablement through external partnerships\nand selective internal development.\nMost new therapeutics will fail at some point in preclinical or clinical development. This is the primary driver of the high cost of developing new therapeutics. A major part of\nthe difficulty in developing new therapeutics is efficient integration of complex and highly dimensional data generated at each stage of development to de-risk subsequent\nstages of the development process. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) has emerged as a digital solution to help address this problem.\nWe use artificial intelligence and machine learning to advance medicines for both internal and external projects. Most current AI/ML platforms still fall short in their ability to\nsynthesize disparate, high-dimensional data for actionable insight. Our platform technology, named, bfLEAP™ is an analytical AI/ML platform developed at The Johns\nHopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL) which is able to surmount the challenges of scalability and flexibility currently hindering researchers and clinicians\nby providing a more precise, multi-dimensional understanding of their data. We are deploying bfLEAP™ for use at several critical stages of development for internal programs\nand through strategic partnerships and collaborations with the intention of streamlining data analytics in therapeutics development, decreasing the overall development costs by\ndecreasing failure rates for new therapeutics, and impacting the lives of countless patients that may otherwise not receive the therapies they need.\nThe bfLEAP™ platform utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning – as such, it is able to reveal real/meaningful connections in the data without the need for a\npriori hypothesis. Algorithms used in the bfLEAP™ platform are designed to handle highly imbalanced data sets to successfully identify combinations of factors that are\nassociated with outcomes of interest.\nOur primary goal is to improve the odds of success at any stage of pre-clinical and clinical therapeutics development, for in house programs, and our strategic partners and\ncollaborators. Our primary business model is enabling the success of ongoing clinical trials or rescue of late stage failed drugs (i.e., Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial failures) for\ndevelopment and divestiture; although, we will also consider collaborations for earlier stage drugs. We hope to accomplish this through strategic acquisitions of current clinical\nstage and failed drugs for in-house development, or through strategic partnerships with biopharmaceutical industry companies. We are able to pursue our drug asset\nenhancement business by leveraging a powerful and proven AI/ML platform (trade name: bfLEAP™) initially developed at JHU-APL. We believe the bfLEAP™ analytics\nplatform is a potentially disruptive tool for analysis of pre-clinical and/or clinical data sets, such as the robust pre-clinical and clinical trial data sets being generated in\ntranslational R&D and clinical trial settings.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe Company has had negative cash flows from operations and operated at a net loss since inception. In the first quarter of 2023, we completed our initial public offering\n(“IPO”). In February 2024 the Company received net proceeds of approximately $4.9 million dollars from an underwritten public offering of 1,507,139 shares of common stock\n(or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants to purchase 1,507,139 shares of common stock at an offering price of $3.782. The 5 year warrants have an\nexercise price of $4.16. On February 21, 2024, the underwriters elected to take an overallotment of 218,382 common shares and the Company received net proceeds of\napproximately $750,000. In the absence of significant revenues in 2024 the Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to fund planned operations for more than\n12 months from the date of this filing.\nF-7\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in\nconformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nOn February 13, 2023, we completed a 1-for-7 reverse split of our common stock. Stockholders’ equity and all references to shares and per share amounts in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, recoverability\nof deferred tax assets and certain other of our accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue based on the following five step model:\n● Identification of the contract with a customer\nThis step outlines the criteria that must be met when establishing a contract with a customer to supply goods or services.\n● Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nThis step describes how distinct performance obligations in the contract must be handled.\n● Determination of the transaction price\nThis step outlines what must be considered when establishing the transaction price, which is the amount the business expects to receive for transferring the goods and\nservices to the customer.\n● Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nThis step outlines guidelines for allocating the transaction price across the contract’s separate performance obligations, and is what the customer agrees to pay for the\ngoods and services.\n● Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nRevenue can be recognized as the business meets each performance obligation. This step specifies how that should happen.\nContract Services\nThe Company anticipates that the majority of revenues to be recognized in the near future will result from our fee for service partnership offering, designed for\nbiopharmaceutical companies, as well as other organizations, of all sizes that have challenges analyzing data throughout the drug development process. The Company provides\nthe customer with an analysis of large complex data sets using the Company’s proprietary Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning platform called bfLEAP™. This platform\nis designed to predict targets of interest, patterns, relationships, and anomalies. The Company believes that there will be additional on-going work requested from partners\ntherefore the service model utilizes a master services agreement with work or task orders issued for discrete analysis performed at the discovery, preclinical, or clinical stages of\ndrug development. The Company receives a cash fee and in some instances the potential for rights to new intellectual property generated from the analysis. Once data analysis\nand the analysis report are complete, the Company delivers the analysis set to the customer and recognizes revenue at that point in time.\nF-8\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying value of short-term instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the relatively short\nperiod to maturity for these instruments.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurements, defined as\nfollows:\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability,\neither directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities that are required to be\nmeasured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nCash\nThe Company considers cash to consist of cash on hand and temporary investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, cash balances were $2,624,730 and $57,670, respectively.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to a concentration of credit risk are cash and accounts receivable. Occasionally, the Company’s cash in interest-bearing\naccounts may exceed FDIC insurance limits. The financial stability of these institutions is periodically reviewed by senior management.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales is comprised of royalties and the cost of outsourced services provided to the Company related to customer service contracts.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective\naccounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition is reflected in earnings. For financial statement purposes, property and equipment are recorded at cost\nand depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\nAdvertising\nThe Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carry forwards and temporary differences\nbetween the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates. The Company records an estimated\nvaluation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.\nInterest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense.\nF-9\nStock-Based Compensation\nEmployee and non-employee share-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite\nservice period.\nNet Loss per Share\nWe calculate basic net loss per share by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents in the period, including unvested stock options and warrants. As we\nhave reported losses for all periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect would be\nantidilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures that requires entities to disclose additional\ninformation about federal, state, and foreign income taxes primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The new standard also eliminates\ncertain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. The guidance is effective for our fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2025. The guidance does not affect recognition or measurement in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company does not believe that any other recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect\non the accompanying financial statements.\n3. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consisted of $8,744 of equipment and has accumulated depreciation of $2,770 and $1,045, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDepreciation expense totaled $1,725 and $1,045 in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n4.

The SAFE provided for automatic conversion into the number of shares of SAFE Preferred\nStock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Conversion Price, defined as either: (1) the SAFE Price (the price per share equal to the Post-Money Valuation Cap divided\nby the Company Capitalization) or (2) the Discount Price (the price per share of the Standard Preferred Stock sold in the Equity Financing multiplied by the Discount\nRate),whichever calculation results in a greater number of shares of SAFE Preferred Stock.\nIn February 2023, the SAFE terminated and converted into 32,967 shares of common stock according to its terms upon the Company’s closing of its IPO. The conversion was\nconsidered a redemption for accounting purposes and consequently, the Company recognized a $63,626 loss on the conversion.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the $150,000 received from the SAFE was recorded at 6% imputed interest.\nAugust 2021 Note\nOn August 19, 2021, the Company entered into a convertible loan agreement with a related party, with a principal balance of $99,900, an original issuance discount of 5% and a\n9% interest rate.

Stockholders’ Equity\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company has 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized at a par value of $0.00001 with 5,500,000 being designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. On\nOctober 5, 2022, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with an Investor providing for the exchange of 734,492 shares of commons stock into 73,449 shares of\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at any time into 10 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Series\nA Preferred Stock is the economic equivalent of the common stock but has no voting rights and is subject to a blocker which prohibits the conversion into common stock if it\nwould result in the Investor owning more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock at such time. The Company evaluated the terms of the exchange and\ndetermined there was no significant change in fair value and therefore the Series A Preferred Stock was valued at $315,000 which is the Investor’s basis in the common stock\nthat was exchanged.\nF-12\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has 100,000,000 shares of common stock authorized at a par value of $0.00001.

The results of this engagement resulted in an increase in the value per share of common stock used in the Black Scholes option pricing model employed to\nvalue the Company’s equity grants and warrant issuances.\nIn February 2023, the Company completed its IPO for the sale of 1,297,318 units (each, a “Unit,” collectively, the “Units”) at a price of $6.50 per Unit for a total of\napproximately $8.4 million of gross proceeds. Each Unit consisted of one share of the Company’s common stock, one tradeable warrant (each, a “Tradeable Warrant,”\ncollectively, the “Tradeable Warrants”) to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.80 per share, and one non-tradeable warrant (each, a “Non-tradeable\nWarrant,” collectively, the “Non-tradeable Warrants”; together with the Tradeable Warrants, each, a “Warrant,” collectively, the “Warrants”) to purchase one share of the\nCompany’s common stock at an exercise price of $8.125.\nIn connection with the completion of its IPO, the Company issued an aggregate of 331,166 shares of common stock upon the conversion of certain outstanding convertible\ndebt.\nIn connection with the IPO, in February 2023, the Company completed a 1-for-7 reverse split of our common stock.

As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 3,521,880\nand 927,373 warrants were not included in the calculation of net loss per share, respectively. In addition, 527,717 and 69,217 options for common shares were not included in\nthe calculation of net loss per share, respectively.\n2022 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted, and its shareholders approved the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides for the granting\nof equity-based awards to employees, directors, and consultants.

Awards are limited to a maximum term of 10 years and any exercise prices\nshall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of one share of common stock on the grant date. The Plan authorizes an initial maximum number of shares underlying\nawards of 900,000 with an automatic annual 15% increase beginning in 2024. As of December 31, 2023, there were 441,500 awards authorized but unissued available under the\nPlan.\nF-13\nStock Options\nThe following tables summarizes the stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nWeighted-Average\nRemaining\nWeighted-Average Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic\nNumber of Shares Exercise Price (Years) Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021 468,571 $ 3.32 7.4 $ -\nGranted - $ -\nExercised - $ -\nForfeited / canceled (399,354) $ -\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 69,217 $ 3.06 7.1 $ -\nGranted 458,500 $ 4.34\nExercised - $ -\nForfeited / canceled - $ -\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 527,717 $ 4.17 9.0 $ 112,141\nVested at December 31, 2023 255,826 $ 4.01 8.5 $ 62,193\nThe fair value of options granted in the year ended December 31, 2023 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions in the table\nbelow:\n2023\nExpected dividend yield 0%\nExpected volatility 87% - 92%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.4% - 4.4%\nExpected life (in years) 5.0 - 6.0\n● Volatility - The trading volatility was determined by calculating the volatility of the Company’s peer group.\n● Expected life of options – The expected life of options granted to employees was determined using the simplified method.\n● Risk-free interest rate – This is the U.S. Treasury rate, having a term comparable to the expected life of the stock option.\n● Dividend yield – The Company does not expect to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3.15.

Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial\nreporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets for federal and state income taxes are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating losses $ 1,432,634 $ 924,000\nCapitalized research and development 283,353 -\nStock-based compensation 175,213 -\nIntangibles 173,273 -\nOther 9,438 -\nTotal deferred tax assets 2,073,911 924,000\nValuation allowance (2,073,459) (924,000)\nNet deferred tax asset 452 -\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty and equipment (452) -\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (452) -\nNet deferred tax asset / (liability) $ - $ -\nRealization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing, and amount of which are uncertain. Because of our lack of U.S. earnings history, the\nnet U.S. deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $1,151,827 and $585,000 during the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has available for federal income tax purposes a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $6.1 million and a total state net\noperation loss carryforward of approximately $2 million. The net operating loss carryforwards do not expire and may be used to offset future taxable income. Utilization of\nsome of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the “change in ownership” provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.\nThe Company has provided a valuation reserve against the full amount of the net operating loss benefit, since in the opinion of management, based upon the earnings history of\nthe Company; it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized. All or portion of the remaining valuation allowance may be reduced in future years based on an\nassessment of earnings sufficient to fully utilize these potential tax benefits.\nWe have incurred net operating losses since inception and we do not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. If we are eventually able to recognize our uncertain positions, our\neffective tax rate would be reduced. We currently have a full valuation allowance against out net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate\nbenefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future. Any adjustments to our uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment of our net\noperating loss or tax credit carry forwards rather than resulting in a cash outlay.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and certain state jurisdictions. We are not currently under examination in these jurisdictions for any tax year. The Company’s tax years\nbeginning with 2020 are open tax years.

Identifying Potential Conflicts of Interest\nEmployees, officers and directors must act in the best interests of the Company. You must refrain from engaging in any activity or having a personal interest that\npresents a “conflict of interest” and should seek to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest occurs when your personal interest interferes with\nthe interests of the Company. A conflict of interest can arise whenever you, as an employee, officer or director, take action or have an interest that prevents you from performing\nyour Company duties and responsibilities honestly, objectively and effectively.\n2\nIdentifying potential conflicts of interest may not always be clear-cut. The following situations might reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest and\nshould be identified to, and addressed by, the Chief Financial Officer or the Board of Directors:\n● Outside Employment. An employee being employed by, serving as a director of, or providing any services to a company that the individual knows or\nsuspects is a material customer, supplier or competitor of the Company (other than services to be provided as part of an employee’s job responsibilities for\nthe Company).\n● Improper Personal Benefits. An employee or director obtaining any material (as to him or her) personal benefits or favors because of his or her position\nwith the Company. Please see “Gifts and Entertainment” below for additional guidelines in this area.\n● Financial Interests. An employee having a “material interest” (ownership or otherwise) in any company that the individual knows or suspects is a material\ncustomer, supplier or competitor of the Company and using his or her position to influence a transaction with such company. Whether an employee has a\n“material interest” will be determined by the Chief Financial Officer or the Board of Directors, as applicable, in light of all of the circumstances, including\nconsideration of the relationship of the employee to the customer, supplier or competitor, the relationship of the employee to the specific transaction and\nthe importance of the interest to the employee having the interest.\n● Loans or Other Financial Transactions. An employee or director obtaining loans or guarantees of personal obligations from, or entering into any other\npersonal financial transaction with, any company that the individual knows or suspects is a material customer, supplier or competitor of the Company. This\nguideline does not prohibit arms-length transactions with banks, brokerage firms or other financial institutions.\n● Service on Boards and Committees. An employee or director serving on a board of directors or trustees or on a committee of any entity (whether profit or\nnot-for-profit) whose interests reasonably would be expected to conflict with those of the Company.\n● Actions of Family Members. The actions of family members outside the workplace may also give rise to the conflicts of interest described above because\nthey may influence an employee’s or director’s objectivity in making decisions on behalf of the Company. For purposes of this Code, “family members”\ninclude your spouse or life-partner, brothers, sisters, parents, in-laws and children whether such relationships are by blood or adoption.\nFor purposes of this Code, a company is a “material” customer if the customer has made payments to the Company in the past year in excess of $200,000 or 5% of the\nCompany’s gross revenues, whichever is greater. A company is a “material” supplier if the supplier has received payments from the Company in the past year in excess of\n$200,000 or 5% of the supplier’s gross revenues, whichever is greater. If you are uncertain whether a particular company is a material customer or supplier, please contact the\nCompany’s Chief Financial Officer for assistance.\n3\nB. Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest\nThe Company requires that employees and directors disclose any situation that reasonably would be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. If you suspect that\nyou have a situation that could give rise to a conflict of interest, or something that others could reasonably perceive as a conflict of interest, you must report it in writing to your\nsupervisor or the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, or if you are a director or executive officer, to the Board of Directors. The Company’s Chief Financial Officer or the\nBoard of Directors, as applicable, will work with you to determine whether you have a conflict of interest and, if so, how best to address it. All transactions that would give rise\nto a conflict of interest involving a director, executive officer or principal financial officer must be approved by the Board of Directors, and any such approval will not be\nconsidered a waiver of this Code.\nIII. CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES\nAs an employee or director of the Company, you have an obligation to advance the Company’s interests when the opportunity to do so arises. If you discover or are\npresented with a business opportunity through the use of corporate property or information or because of your position with the Company, you should first present the business\nopportunity to the Company before pursuing the opportunity in your individual capacity. No employee or director may use corporate property, information or his or her position\nwith the Company for personal gain while employed by us or, for a director, while serving on our Board of Directors.\nYou should disclose to your supervisor the terms and conditions of each business opportunity covered by this Code that you wish to pursue. Your supervisor will\ncontact the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and the appropriate management personnel to determine whether the Company wishes to pursue the business opportunity. If the\nCompany waives its right to pursue the business opportunity, you may pursue the business opportunity on the same terms and conditions as originally proposed and consistent\nwith the other ethical guidelines set forth in this Code.\nIV. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\nEmployees and directors have access to a variety of confidential information regarding the Company. Confidential information includes all non-public information that\nmight be of use to competitors, or, if disclosed, harmful to the Company or its collaborators, customers or suppliers. Employees and directors have a duty to safeguard all\nconfidential information of the Company or third parties with which the Company conducts business, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Unauthorized\ndisclosure of any confidential information is prohibited. Additionally, employees and directors should take appropriate precautions to ensure that confidential or sensitive\nbusiness information, whether it is proprietary to the Company or another company, is not communicated within the Company except to employees and directors who have a\nneed to know such information to perform their responsibilities for the Company. An employee’s and director’s obligation to protect confidential information continues after he\nor she leaves the Company. Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could cause competitive harm to the Company or its collaborators, customers or suppliers and\ncould result in legal liability to you and the Company.\nAny questions or concerns regarding whether disclosure of Company information is legally mandated should be promptly referred to the Company’s Chief Financial\nOfficer.\n4\nV. COMPETITION AND FAIR DEALING\nAll employees should endeavor to deal fairly with fellow employees and with the Company’s collaborators, licensors, customers, suppliers and competitors.\nEmployees should not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other\nunfair-dealing practice. Employees should maintain and protect any intellectual property licensed from licensors with the same care as they employ with regard to Company-\ndeveloped intellectual property. Employees should also handle the nonpublic information of our collaborators, licensors, suppliers and customers responsibly and in accordance\nwith our agreements with them, including information regarding their technology and product pipelines.\nVI. GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT\nThe giving and receiving of gifts is a common business practice. Appropriate business gifts and entertainment are welcome courtesies designed to build relationships\nand understanding among business partners. Gifts and entertainment, however, should not compromise, or appear to compromise, your ability to make objective and fair\nbusiness decisions. In addition, it is important to note that the giving and receiving of gifts are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company’s\noperations. These include, without limitation, laws covering the marketing of products, bribery and kickbacks. You are expected to understand and comply with all laws, rules\nand regulations that apply to your job position.\nIt is your responsibility to use good judgment in this area. As a general rule, you may give or receive gifts or entertainment to or from collaborators, customers or\nsuppliers only if the gift or entertainment is infrequent, modest, intended to further legitimate business goals, in compliance with applicable law, and provided the gift or\nentertainment would not be viewed as an inducement to or reward for any particular business decision. All gifts and entertainment expenses should be properly accounted for\non expense reports.\nIf you conduct business in other countries, you must be particularly careful that gifts and entertainment are not construed as bribes, kickbacks or other improper\npayments. See “The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act” section of this Code for a more detailed discussion of our policies regarding giving or receiving gifts related to business\ntransactions in other countries.\nYou should make every effort to refuse or return a gift that is beyond these permissible guidelines. If it would be inappropriate to refuse a gift or you are unable to\nreturn a gift, you should promptly report the gift to your supervisor. Your supervisor will bring the gift to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer, who may require you to\ndonate the gift to an appropriate community organization. If you have any questions about whether it is permissible to accept a gift or something else of value, contact your\nsupervisor or a principal financial officer for additional guidance.\nNote: Gifts and entertainment may not be offered or exchanged under any circumstances to or with any employees of the U.S. government or state or local\ngovernments. If you have any questions about this policy, contact your supervisor or the Company’s Chief Financial Officer for additional guidance. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of special considerations applicable to dealing with the U.S., state and local governments, see “Interactions with Governments.”\n5\nVII.

You are expected to\nunderstand and comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your job position. If any doubt exists about whether a course of action is lawful, you should seek advice\nfrom your supervisor or the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.\nA. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Interactions with the Food And Drug Administration\nThe Company’s products, product candidates and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”)\nunder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The FDA regulates many areas of the Company’s operations, including, but\nnot limited to, the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or\napproval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, sale and distribution of our products. The FDA also regulates the export of products manufactured in the\nUnited States to international markets.

These employees are expected to have a thorough understanding of the laws, regulations and other relevant standards applicable to their job positions, and\nto comply with those requirements.

Work activities covered by this policy include meetings with\nlegislators or members of their staffs or with senior executive branch officials on behalf of the Company. Preparation, research and other background activities that are done in\nsupport of lobbying communication are also covered by this policy even if the communication ultimately is not made. If any doubt exists about whether a given work activity\nwould be considered covered by this provision, you should seek advice immediately from your supervisor and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.\nC. Political Contributions and Volunteer Activities\nThe Company encourages its employees and directors to participate in the political process as individuals and on their own time. However, federal and state\ncontribution and lobbying laws severely limit the contributions the Company can make to political parties or candidates. It is Company policy that Company funds or assets not\nbe used to make a political contribution to any political party or candidate, unless prior approval has been given by our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. The\nCompany will not reimburse you for personal political contributions. When you participate in non-Company political affairs, you should be careful to make it clear that your\nviews and actions are your own, and not made on behalf of the Company. Please contact the Company’s Chief Financial Officer if you have any questions about this policy.\nD. Compliance with Antitrust Laws\nAntitrust laws of the United States and other countries are designed to protect consumers and competitors against unfair business practices and to promote and\npreserve competition. Our policy is to compete vigorously and ethically while complying with all antitrust, monopoly, competition or cartel laws in all countries, states or\nlocalities in which the Company conducts business. Violations of antitrust laws may result in severe penalties against the Company and its employees, including potentially\nsubstantial fines and criminal sanctions. You are expected to maintain basic familiarity with the antitrust principles applicable to your activities, and you should consult the\nCompany’s Chief Financial Officer with any questions you may have concerning compliance with these laws.\n1. Meetings with Competitors\nEmployees should exercise caution in meetings with competitors. Any meeting with a competitor may give rise to the appearance of impropriety.

You should try to meet with competitors in a\nclosely monitored, controlled environment for a limited period of time. You should create and circulate agendas in advance of any such meetings, and the contents of your\nmeeting should be fully documented.\n8\n2. Professional Organizations and Trade Associations\nEmployees should be cautious when attending meetings of professional organizations and trade associations at which competitors are present. Attending meetings of\nprofessional organizations and trade associations is both legal and proper, if such meetings have a legitimate business purpose and are conducted in an open fashion, adhering to\na proper agenda. At such meetings, you should not discuss the Company’s pricing policies or other competitive terms or any other proprietary, competitively sensitive\ninformation. You are required to notify your supervisor or the Company’s Chief Financial Officer prior to attending any meeting of a professional organization or trade\nassociation.\nE. Compliance with Insider Trading Laws\nConsistent with the Company’s Insider Trading Compliance Policy, the Company’s employees and directors are prohibited from trading in the stock or other securities\nof the Company while in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company. In addition, Company employees and directors are prohibited from recommending,\n“tipping” or suggesting that anyone else buy or sell the Company’s stock or other securities on the basis of material non-public information. Employees and directors who\nobtain material non-public information about another company in the course of their duties are prohibited from trading in the stock or securities of the other company while in\npossession of such information or “tipping” others to trade on the basis of such information. Violation of insider trading laws can result in severe fines and criminal penalties, as\nwell as disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including, for an employee, termination of employment or, for a director, a request that such director resign from the\nBoard of Directors. You are required to read carefully and observe our Insider Trading Compliance Policy, as amended from time to time. Please contact the Company’s Chief\nFinancial Officer for a copy of the Insider Trading Compliance Policy or with any questions you may have about insider trading laws.\nXI. PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS AND REGULATION FD\nA. Public Communications Generally\nThe Company places a high value on its credibility and reputation in the community. What is written or said about the Company in the news media and investment\ncommunity directly impacts our reputation, positively or negatively. Our policy is to provide timely, accurate and complete information in response to public requests (from\nmedia, analysts, etc.), consistent with our obligations to maintain the confidentiality of competitive and proprietary information and to prevent selective disclosure of market-\nsensitive financial data. The Company has adopted a separate Policy Statement – Guidelines for Corporate Disclosure to maintain the Company’s credibility and reputation in\nthe community, to maintain the confidentiality of competitive and proprietary information and to prevent selective disclosure of market-sensitive financial data.\n9\nB. Compliance with Regulation FD\nIn connection with its public communications, the Company is required to comply with a rule under the federal securities laws referred to as Regulation FD (which\nstands for “fair disclosure”). Regulation FD provides that, when we disclose material non-public information about the Company to securities market professionals or\nstockholders (where it is reasonably foreseeable that the stockholders will trade on the information), we must also disclose the information to the public. “Securities market\nprofessionals” generally include analysts, institutional investors and other investment advisors.\nThe Company has designated certain individuals as “spokespersons” who are responsible for communicating with analysts, institutional investors and representatives\nof the media. Any employee or director who is not a designated spokesperson of the Company should not communicate any information about the Company to analysts,\ninstitutional investors or representatives of the media, except at the request of the Company’s designated spokespersons.\nFor more information on the Company’s policies and procedures regarding public communications and Regulation FD, please contact the Company’s Chief Financial\nOfficer for a copy of the Company’s Policy Statement – Guidelines for Corporate Disclosure or with any questions you may have about disclosure matters.\nXII. ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT\nThe Company is committed to complying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other applicable anti-corruption laws. The FCPA prohibits the\nCompany and its employees, directors, officers, and agents from offering, giving, or promising money or any other item of value, directly or indirectly, to win or retain business\nor to influence any act or decision of any government official, political party, candidate for political office, or official of a public international organization. The Company\nprohibits employees, directors, and officers from giving or receiving bribes, kickbacks, or other inducements to foreign officials. This prohibition also extends to payments to\nagents acting on the Company’s behalf if there is reason to believe that the payment will be used indirectly for a prohibited payment to foreign officials. Indirect payments\ninclude any transfer of money or other item of value to another individual or organization where the person making the transfer knows or has reason to know that some or all of\nthat transfer is for the benefit of an individual to whom direct payments are prohibited. The use of agents for the payment of bribes, kickbacks or other inducements is expressly\nprohibited. Violation of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws is a crime that can result in severe fines and criminal penalties, as well as disciplinary action by the\nCompany, up to and including, for an employee, termination of employment or, for a director, a request that such director resign from the Board of Directors. For further\nguidance, please contact the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.\nXIII. INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAWS\nCompany employees and agents must know and comply with U.S. laws and regulations that govern international operations, as well the local laws of countries where\nthe Company operates. The United States and many countries have laws that restrict or otherwise require licensing for the export or import of certain goods and services to\nother countries or to certain parties. If you are involved with importing, you need to be aware of the applicable governmental regulations and requirements, including those\nrequired by the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). A failure to comply can result in fines, penalties, imprisonment and/or a loss of import privileges. U.S.\nlaws and regulations also impose various trade sanctions or embargoes against other countries or persons, and prohibit cooperation with certain boycotts imposed by some\ncountries against others. The Company does not participate in prohibited boycotts.\n10\nThe scope of these licensing requirements, trade sanctions, and trade embargoes may vary from country to country. They may range from specific prohibitions on trade\nof a given item to a total prohibition of all commercial transactions. It is important to note that the Company may not facilitate or encourage a non-domestic company to\nperform a transaction that it could not perform itself pursuant to sanctions laws.\nEmployees involved in export transactions or international operations must familiarize themselves with the list of countries against which the United States maintains\ncomprehensive sanctions and the rules relating to exporting to or transacting with such countries, either directly or indirectly through foreign subsidiaries or other third parties.\nIn addition, the Company must comply with counter-terrorism requirements when engaging in international trade. Due to the complexities of these international trade laws,\ncontact the Chief Financial Officer before exporting or importing goods or services, or engaging in transactions with countries or persons that may be affected by economic or\ntrade sanctions. If requested to participate in or cooperate with an international boycott that the United States does not support (e.g., the boycott of Israel sponsored by the Arab\nLeague), you may not agree to or comply with such request. Immediately report this request to the Chief Financial Officer.\nXIV. ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY\nThe Company is committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment for its employees and to avoiding adverse impact and injury to the environment and\nthe communities in which it does business. Company employees must comply with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and Company standards.

You should contact the Company’s Chief Financial Officer if you have any questions about the laws, regulations and policies that apply to you.\nA. Environment\nAll Company employees should strive to conserve resources and reduce waste and emissions through recycling and other energy conservation measures. You have a\nresponsibility to promptly report any known or suspected violations of environmental laws or any events that may result in a discharge or emission of hazardous materials.\nB. Health and Safety\nThe Company is committed not only to comply with all relevant health and safety laws, but also to conduct business in a manner that protects the safety of its\nemployees. All employees are required to comply with all applicable health and safety laws, regulations and policies relevant to their positions.

All complaints will be treated with sensitivity and discretion.\nYour supervisor and the Company will protect your confidentiality to the extent possible, consistent with law and the Company’s need to investigate your concern. Where our\ninvestigation uncovers harassment or discrimination, we will take prompt corrective action, which may include disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including,\ntermination of employment. The Company strictly prohibits retaliation against an employee who, in good faith, files a complaint.\nAny member of management who has reason to believe that an employee has been the victim of harassment or discrimination or who receives a report of alleged\nharassment or discrimination is required to report it to the relevant human resources personnel immediately.\nE. Alcohol and Drugs\nThe Company is committed to maintaining a drug-free work place. All Company employees must comply strictly with Company policies regarding the abuse of\nalcohol and the possession, sale and use of illegal drugs (for the purpose of this Code, “illegal drugs” includes marijuana). Drinking alcoholic beverages is prohibited while on\nduty or on the premises of the Company, except at specified Company-sanctioned events or as otherwise authorized by management. Possessing, using, selling or offering\nillegal drugs and other controlled substances is prohibited under all circumstances while on duty or on the premises of the Company.

If\nyou experience, witness or otherwise become aware of a violent or potentially violent situation that occurs on the Company’s property or affects the Company’s business you\nmust immediately report the situation to your supervisor or the relevant human resources personnel.\nThe Company does not permit any individual to have weapons of any kind on Company property or in vehicles, while on the job or off-site while on Company\nbusiness. This is true even if you have obtained legal permits to carry weapons. The only exception to this policy applies to security personnel who are specifically authorized\nby Company management to carry weapons.\nXV.

SUMMARY\nPreventing insider trading is necessary to comply with securities laws and to preserve the reputation and integrity of Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as\nwell as that of all persons affiliated with the Company. “Insider trading” occurs when any person purchases or sells a security while in possession of inside information relating\nto the security. As explained in Section III below, “inside information” is information that is both “material” and “non-public.” Insider trading is a crime. The penalties for\nviolating insider trading laws include imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, civil fines, and significant criminal fines. Insider trading is also prohibited by this Policy, and\nviolation of this Policy may result in Company-imposed sanctions, including termination of employment for cause.\nThis Policy applies to all officers, directors and employees of the Company. Individuals subject to this Policy are responsible for ensuring that members of their\nhouseholds also comply with this Policy. This Policy also applies to any entities controlled by individuals subject to the Policy, including any corporations, partnerships or\ntrusts (such entities, together with all officers, directors and employees of the Company, are referred to as the “Covered Persons”), and transactions by these entities should be\ntreated for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if they were for the individual’s own account. This Policy extends to all activities within and outside an\nindividual’s Company duties. Every officer, director and employee must review this Policy. Questions regarding the Policy should be directed to the Company’s Chief Financial\nOfficer, or such person performing duties similar to those performed by a Chief Financial Officer (the “Chief Financial Officer”).\nII. STATEMENT OF POLICIES PROHIBITING INSIDER TRADING\nNo officer, director or employee shall purchase or sell any type of security while in possession of material, non-public information relating to the security, whether the\nissuer of such security is the Company or any other company.\nAdditionally, no officer, director or other employee designated from time to time by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial\nOfficer as being subject to quarterly blackout periods shall purchase or sell any security of the Company during the period beginning at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on\nthe seventh calendar day before the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company and ending upon the completion of the second full trading day after the public release of\nearnings data for such fiscal quarter or during any other trading suspension period declared by the Company. For example, if the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter\nends at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 31, the corresponding blackout period would begin at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 24. For the purposes of\nthis Policy, a “trading day” is a day on which national stock exchanges are open for trading. For the avoidance of doubt, any designation by the Board of Directors of the\nemployees who are subject to quarterly blackout periods may be updated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.\nThese prohibitions do not apply to:\n● purchases of the Company’s securities by a Covered Person from the Company or sales of the Company’s securities by a Covered Person to the Company;\n● exercises of stock options or other equity awards or the surrender of shares to the Company in payment of the exercise price or in satisfaction of any tax\nwithholding obligations in a manner permitted by the applicable equity award agreement, or vesting of equity-based awards, that in each case do not involve a\nmarket sale of the Company’s securities (the “cashless exercise” of a Company stock option through a broker does involve a market sale of the Company’s\nsecurities, and therefore would not qualify under this exception);\n● bona fide gifts of the Company’s securities; or\n● purchases or sales of the Company’s securities made pursuant to any binding contract, specific instruction or written plan entered into outside of a black-out\nperiod and while the purchaser or seller, as applicable, was unaware of any material, non-public information and which contract, instruction or plan (i) meets\nall of the requirements of the affirmative defense provided by Rule 10b5-1 (“Rule 10b5-1”) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “1934 Act”), (ii) was pre-cleared in advance pursuant to this Policy and (iii) has not been amended or modified in any respect after such initial\npre-clearance without such amendment or modification being pre-cleared in advance pursuant to this Policy. For more information about Rule 10b5-1 trading\nplans, see Section VI below.\nNo officer, director or employee shall directly or indirectly communicate (or “tip”) material, non-public information to anyone outside of the Company (except in\naccordance with the Company’s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of Company information) or to anyone within the Company other than on a\nneed-to-know basis.\n2\nIII. EXPLANATION OF INSIDER TRADING\n“Insider trading” refers to the purchase or sale of a security while in possession of “material,” “non-public” information relating to the security or its issuer.\n“Securities” includes stocks, bonds, notes, debentures, options, warrants and other convertible securities, as well as derivative instruments.\n“Purchase” and “sale” are defined broadly under the federal securities law. “Purchase” includes not only the actual purchase of a security, but any contract to\npurchase or otherwise acquire a security. “Sale” includes not only the actual sale of a security, but any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of a security. These definitions\nextend to a broad range of transactions, including conventional cash-for-stock transactions, conversions, the exercise of stock options, and acquisitions and exercises of\nwarrants or puts, calls or other derivative securities.\nIt is generally understood that insider trading includes the following:\n● trading by insiders while in possession of material, non-public information;\n● trading by persons other than insiders while in possession of material, non-public information, if the information either was given in breach of an insider’s\nfiduciary duty to keep it confidential or was misappropriated; and\n● communicating or tipping material, non-public information to others, including recommending the purchase or sale of a security while in possession of such\ninformation.\nA. What Facts are Material?\nThe materiality of a fact depends upon the circumstances. A fact is considered “material” if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it\nimportant in making a decision to buy, sell or hold a security, or if the fact is likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the security. Material information can be\npositive or negative and can relate to virtually any aspect of a company’s business or to any type of security, debt or equity.\nExamples of material information include (but are not limited to) information about:\n● corporate earnings or earnings forecasts;\n● possible mergers, acquisitions, tender offers or dispositions;\n● major new products or product developments;\n● important business developments such as trial results, developments regarding strategic collaborators or the status of regulatory submissions;\n● management or control changes;\n● significant financing developments including pending public sales or offerings of debt or equity securities;\n● defaults on borrowings;\n● bankruptcies; and\n● significant litigation or regulatory actions.\n3\nMoreover, material information does not have to be related to a company’s business. For example, the contents of a forthcoming newspaper column that is expected to\naffect the market price of a security can be material.\nA good general rule of thumb: When in doubt, do not trade.\nB. What is Non-Public?\nInformation is “non-public” if it is not available to the general public. In order for information to be considered public, it must be widely disseminated in a manner\nmaking it generally available to investors through such media as Dow Jones, Business Wire, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, or United Press International, a\nbroadcast on widely available radio or television programs, publication in a widely available newspaper, magazine or news web site, a Regulation FD-compliant conference\ncall, or public disclosure documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that are available on the SEC’s web site.\nThe circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media, does not constitute effective public dissemination. In addition, even after a public announcement,\na reasonable period of time must lapse in order for the market to react to the information. Generally, one should allow two full trading days following publication as a\nreasonable waiting period before such information is deemed to be public. If, for example, the Company were to make an announcement on a Monday prior to 9:30 a.m.\nEastern time, the information would be deemed public after the close of trading on Tuesday. If an announcement were made on a Monday after 9:30 a.m. Eastern time, the\ninformation would be deemed public after the close of trading on Wednesday. If you have any question as to whether information is publicly available, please direct an inquiry\nto the Chief Financial Officer.\nC. Who is an Insider?\n“Insiders” include officers, directors and employees of a company and anyone else who has material inside information about a company. Insiders have independent\nfiduciary duties to their company and its stockholders not to trade on material, non-public information relating to the company’s securities. All officers, directors and employees\nof the Company should consider themselves insiders with respect to material, non-public information about the Company’s business, activities and securities. Officers, directors\nand employees may not trade in the Company’s securities while in possession of material, non-public information relating to the Company, nor may they tip such information to\nanyone outside the Company (except in accordance with the Company’s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of Company information) or to\nanyone within the Company other than on a need-to-know basis.\nIndividuals subject to this Policy are responsible for ensuring that members of their households also comply with this Policy. This Policy also applies to any entities\ncontrolled by individuals subject to the Policy, including any corporations, partnerships or trusts, and transactions by these entities should be treated for the purposes of this\nPolicy and applicable securities laws as if they were for the individual’s own account.\n4\nD. Trading by Persons Other than Insiders\nInsiders may be liable for communicating or tipping material, non-public information to a third party (“tippee”), and insider trading violations are not limited to trading\nor tipping by insiders. Persons other than insiders also can be liable for insider trading, including tippees who trade on material, non-public information tipped to them or\nindividuals who trade on material, non-public information that has been misappropriated.\nTippees inherit an insider’s duties and are liable for trading on material, non-public information illegally tipped to them by an insider. Similarly, just as insiders are\nliable for the insider trading of their tippees, so are tippees who pass the information along to others who trade. In other words, a tippee’s liability for insider trading is no\ndifferent from that of an insider. Tippees can obtain material, non-public information by receiving overt tips from others or through, among other things, conversations at social,\nbusiness, or other gatherings.\nE. Penalties for Engaging in Insider Trading\nPenalties for trading on or tipping material, non-public information can extend significantly beyond any profits made or losses avoided, both for individuals engaging\nin such unlawful conduct and their employers. The SEC and Department of Justice have made the civil and criminal prosecution of insider trading violations a top priority.\nEnforcement remedies available to the government or private plaintiffs under the federal securities laws include:\n● SEC administrative sanctions;\n● securities industry self-regulatory organization sanctions;\n● civil injunctions;\n● damage awards to private plaintiffs;\n● disgorgement of all profits;\n● civil fines for the violator of up to three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided;\n● civil fines for the employer or other controlling person of a violator (i.e., where the violator is an employee or other controlled person) of up to the greater of\n$1,525,000 (subject to adjustment for inflation) or three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided by the violator;\n● criminal fines for individual violators of up to $5,000,000 ($25,000,000 for an entity); and\n● jail sentences of up to 20 years.\nIn addition, insider trading could result in serious sanctions by the Company, including dismissal. Insider trading violations are not limited to violations of the federal\nsecurities laws. Other federal and state civil or criminal laws, such as the laws prohibiting mail and wire fraud and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(RICO), also may be violated in connection with insider trading.\n5\nF. Size of Transaction and Reason for Transaction Do Not Matter\nThe size of the transaction or the amount of profit received does not have to be significant to result in prosecution. The SEC has the ability to monitor even the smallest\ntrades, and the SEC performs routine market surveillance. Brokers and dealers are required by law to inform the SEC of any possible violations by people who may have\nmaterial, non-public information. The SEC aggressively investigates even small insider trading violations.\nG. Examples of Insider Trading\nExamples of insider trading cases include:\n● actions brought against corporate officers, directors, and employees who traded in a company’s securities after learning of significant confidential corporate\ndevelopments;\n● friends, business associates, family members and other tippees of such officers, directors, and employees who traded in the securities after receiving such\ninformation;\n● government employees who learned of such information in the course of their employment; and\n● other persons who misappropriated, and took advantage of, confidential information from their employers.\nThe following are illustrations of insider trading violations. These illustrations are hypothetical and, consequently, not intended to reflect on the actual activities or\nbusiness of the Company or any other entity.\nTrading by Insider\nAn officer of X Corporation learns that earnings to be reported by X Corporation will increase dramatically. Prior to the public announcement of such earnings, the\nofficer purchases X Corporation’s stock. The officer, an insider, is liable for all profits as well as penalties of up to three times the amount of all profits. The officer\nalso is subject to, among other things, criminal prosecution, including up to $5,000,000 in additional fines and 20 years in jail. Depending upon the circumstances, X\nCorporation and the individual to whom the officer reports also could be liable as controlling persons.\nTrading by Tippee\nAn officer of X Corporation tells a friend that X Corporation is about to publicly announce that it has signed an agreement for a major acquisition. This tip causes the\nfriend to purchase X Corporation’s stock in advance of the announcement. The officer is jointly liable with his friend for all of the friend’s profits, and each is liable for\nall civil penalties of up to three times the amount of the friend’s profits. The officer and his friend are also subject to criminal prosecution and other remedies and\nsanctions, as described above.\n6\nH. Prohibition of Records Falsification and False Statements\nSection 13(b)(2) of the 1934 Act requires companies subject to the Act to maintain proper internal books and records and to devise and maintain an adequate system of\ninternal accounting controls. The SEC has supplemented the statutory requirements by adopting rules that prohibit (1) any person from falsifying records or accounts subject to\nthe above requirements and (2) officers or directors from making any materially false, misleading, or incomplete statement to any accountant in connection with any audit or\nfiling with the SEC. These provisions reflect the SEC’s intent to discourage officers, directors and other persons with access to the Company’s books and records from taking\naction that might result in the communication of materially misleading financial information to the investing public.\nIV. STATEMENT OF PROCEDURES PREVENTING INSIDER TRADING\nThe following procedures have been established, and will be maintained and enforced, by the Company to prevent insider trading. Every officer, director and employee\nis required to follow these procedures.\nA. Pre-Clearance of All Trades by All Officers, Directors and Certain Employees\nTo provide assistance in preventing inadvertent violations of applicable securities laws and to avoid the appearance of impropriety in connection with the purchase and\nsale of the Company’s securities, all transactions in the Company’s securities (including without limitation, acquisitions and dispositions of Company stock, the\nexercise of stock options and the sale of Company stock issued upon exercise of stock options) by officers, directors and such other employees as are designated from\ntime to time by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer as being subject to this pre-clearance process (each, a “Pre-\nClearance Person”) must be pre-cleared by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. Pre-clearance does not relieve anyone of his or her responsibility under SEC rules. For the\navoidance of doubt, any designation by the Board of Directors of the employees who are subject to pre-clearance may be updated from time to time by the Chief Executive\nOfficer or Chief Financial Officer.\nA request for pre-clearance may be oral or in writing (including without limitation by e-mail), should be made at least two business days in advance of the proposed\ntransaction and should include the identity of the Pre-Clearance Person, the type of proposed transaction (for example, an open market purchase, a privately negotiated sale, an\noption exercise, etc.), the proposed date of the transaction and the number of shares or options to be involved. In addition, unless otherwise determined by the Chief Financial\nOfficer, the Pre-Clearance Person must execute a certification (in the form approved by the Chief Financial Officer) that he, she or it is not aware of material, nonpublic\ninformation about the Company. The Chief Financial Officer shall have sole discretion to decide whether to clear any contemplated transaction, provided that the Chief\nExecutive Officer shall have sole discretion to decide whether to clear transactions by the Chief Financial Officer or persons or entities subject to this policy as a result of their\nrelationship with the Chief Financial Officer. All trades that are pre-cleared must be effected within five business days of receipt of the pre-clearance unless a specific exception\nhas been granted by the Chief Financial Officer (or the Chief Executive Officer, in the case of the Chief Financial Officer or persons or entities subject to this policy as a result\nof their relationship with the Chief Financial Officer). A pre-cleared trade (or any portion of a pre-cleared trade) that has not been effected during the five business day period\nmust be pre-cleared again prior to execution. Notwithstanding receipt of pre-clearance, if the Pre-Clearance Person becomes aware of material, non-public information or\nbecomes subject to a black-out period before the transaction is effected, the transaction may not be completed.\n7\nB. Black-Out Periods\nAdditionally, no officer, director or other employee designated from time to time by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial\nOfficer as being subject to quarterly blackout periods shall purchase or sell any security of the Company during the period beginning at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on\nthe seventh calendar day before the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company and ending upon the completion of the second full trading day after the public release of\nearnings data for such fiscal quarter or during any other trading suspension period declared by the Company, except for purchases and sales made pursuant to the\npermitted transactions described in Section II. For example, if the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter ends at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 31, the corresponding\nblackout period would begin at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 24.\nExceptions to the black-out period policy may be approved only by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (or, in the case of an exception for the Chief Financial\nOfficer or persons or entities subject to this policy as a result of their relationship with the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer or, in the case of exceptions for\ndirectors or persons or entities subject to this policy as a result of their relationship with a director, the Board of Directors).\nFrom time to time, the Company, through the Board of Directors, the Company’s disclosure committee or the Chief Financial Officer, may recommend that officers,\ndirectors, employees or others suspend trading in the Company’s securities because of developments that have not yet been disclosed to the public. Subject to the exceptions\nnoted above, all of those affected should not trade in the Company’s securities while the suspension is in effect, and should not disclose to others that the Company has\nsuspended trading.\nIf the Company is required to impose a “pension fund black-out period” under Regulation BTR, each director and executive officer shall not, directly or indirectly sell,\npurchase or otherwise transfer during such black-out period any equity securities of the Company acquired in connection with his or her service as a director or officer of the\nCompany, except as permitted by Regulation BTR.\nC. Post-Termination Transactions\nIf an individual is in possession of material, non-public information when his or her service terminates, that individual may not trade in the Company’s securities until\nthat information has become public or is no longer material.\nD. Information Relating to the Company\n1. Access to Information\nAccess to material, non-public information about the Company, including the Company’s business, earnings or prospects, should be limited to officers, directors and\nemployees of the Company on a need-to-know basis. In addition, such information should not be communicated to anyone outside the Company under any circumstances\n(except in accordance with the Company’s policies regarding the protection or authorized external disclosure of Company information) or to anyone within the Company on an\nother than need-to-know basis.\n8\nIn communicating material, non-public information to employees of the Company, all officers, directors and employees must take care to emphasize the need for\nconfidential treatment of such information and adherence to the Company’s policies with regard to confidential information.\n2. Inquiries From Third Parties\nInquiries from third parties, such as industry analysts or members of the media, about the Company should be directed to the Chief Financial Officer.\nE. Limitations on Access to Company Information\nThe following procedures are designed to maintain confidentiality with respect to the Company’s business operations and activities.\nAll officers, directors and employees should take all steps and precautions necessary to restrict access to, and secure, material, non-public information by, among other\nthings:\n● maintaining the confidentiality of Company-related transactions;\n● conducting their business and social activities so as not to risk inadvertent disclosure of confidential information. Review of confidential documents in public\nplaces should be conducted so as to prevent access by unauthorized persons;\n● restricting access to documents and files (including computer files) containing material, non-public information to individuals on a need-to-know basis\n(including maintaining control over the distribution of documents and drafts of documents);\n● promptly removing and cleaning up all confidential documents and other materials from conference rooms following the conclusion of any meetings;\n● disposing of all confidential documents and other papers, after there is no longer any business or other legally required need, through shredders when\nappropriate;\n● restricting access to areas likely to contain confidential documents or material, non-public information;\n● safeguarding laptop computers, mobile devices, tablets, memory sticks, CDs and other items that contain confidential information; and\n● avoiding the discussion of material, non-public information in places where the information could be overheard by others such as in elevators, restrooms,\nhallways, restaurants, airplanes or taxicabs.\nPersonnel involved with material, non-public information, to the extent feasible, should conduct their business and activities in areas separate from other Company\nactivities.\n9\nV. ADDITIONAL PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company has determined that there is a heightened legal risk and/or the appearance of improper or inappropriate conduct if the persons subject to this Policy\nengage in certain types of transactions. Therefore, officers, directors and employees shall comply with the following policies with respect to certain transactions in the\nCompany securities:\nA. Short Sales\nShort sales of the Company’s securities evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore signal to the market that\nthe seller has no confidence in the Company or its short-term prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce the seller’s incentive to improve the Company’s performance. For\nthese reasons, short sales of the Company’s securities are prohibited by this Policy. In addition, as noted below, Section 16(c) of the 1934 Act absolutely prohibits Section 16\nreporting persons from making short sales of the Company’s equity securities, i.e., sales of shares that the insider does not own at the time of sale, or sales of shares against\nwhich the insider does not deliver the shares within 20 days after the sale.\nB. Options\nA transaction in options is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement of the Company’s stock and therefore creates the appearance that an officer, director or\nemployee is trading based on inside information. Transactions in options, whether traded on an exchange, on any other organized market or on an over-the-counter market, also\nmay focus an officer’s, director’s or employee’s attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company’s long-term objectives. Accordingly, transactions in puts,\ncalls or other derivative securities involving the Company’s equity securities, on an exchange, on or in any other organized market or on an over-the-counter market, are\nprohibited by this Policy.\nC. Hedging Transactions\nPurchasing financial instruments, such as prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds, or otherwise engaging in transactions that\nhedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of the Company’s equity securities, may cause an officer, director, or employee to no longer\nhave the same objectives as the Company’s other stockholders. Therefore, all such transactions involving the Company’s equity securities, whether such securities were granted\nas compensation or are otherwise held, directly or indirectly, are prohibited by this Policy.\nD. Purchases of the Company’s Securities on Margin; Pledging the Company’s Securities to Secure Margin or Other Loans\nPurchasing on margin means borrowing from a brokerage firm, bank or other entity in order to purchase the Company’s securities (other than in connection with a\ncashless exercise of stock options through a broker under the Company’s equity plans). Margin purchases of the Company’s securities are prohibited by this Policy. Pledging\nthe Company’s securities as collateral to secure loans is prohibited. This prohibition means, among other things, that you cannot hold the Company’s securities in a “margin\naccount” (which would allow you to borrow against your holdings to buy securities).\n10\nE. Director and Executive Officer Cashless Exercises\nThe Company will not arrange with brokers to administer cashless exercises on behalf of directors and executive officers of the Company. Directors and executive\nofficers of the Company may use the cashless exercise feature of their equity awards only if (i) the director or officer retains a broker independently of the Company, (ii) the\nCompany’s involvement is limited to confirming that it will deliver the stock promptly upon payment of the exercise price, (iii) the director or officer uses a “T+2” cashless\nexercise arrangement, in which the Company agrees to deliver stock against the payment of the purchase price on the same day the sale of the stock underlying the equity award\nsettles and (iv) the director or officer otherwise complies with this Policy. Under a T+2 cashless exercise, a broker, the issuer, and the issuer’s transfer agent work together to\nmake all transactions settle simultaneously. This approach is to avoid any inference that the Company has “extended credit” in the form of a personal loan to the director or\nexecutive officer. Questions about cashless exercises should be directed to the Chief Financial Officer.\nF. Partnership Distributions\nNothing in this Policy is intended to limit the ability of a venture capital partnership or other similar entity with which a director is affiliated to distribute Company\nsecurities to its partners, members or other similar persons. It is the responsibility of each affected director and the affiliated entity, in consultation with their own counsel (as\nappropriate), to determine the timing of any distributions, based on all relevant facts and circumstances and applicable securities laws.\nVI. RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS, SECTION 16 AND RULE 144\nA. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\n1. Overview\nRule 10b5-1 will protect directors, officers and employees from insider trading liability under Rule 10b5-1 for transactions under a previously established contract,\nplan or instruction to trade in the Company’s stock (a “Trading Plan”) entered into in good faith and in accordance with the terms of Rule 10b5-1 and all applicable state laws\nand will be exempt from the trading restrictions set forth in this Policy. The initiation of, and any modification to, any such Trading Plan will be deemed to be a transaction in\nthe Company’s securities, and such initiation or modification is subject to all limitations and prohibitions relating to transactions in the Company’s securities. Each such Trading\nPlan, and any modification thereof, must be submitted to and pre-approved by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, or such other person as the Board of Directors may\ndesignate from time to time (the “Authorizing Officer”), who may impose such conditions on the implementation and operation of the Trading Plan as the Authorizing Officer\ndeems necessary or advisable. However, compliance of the Trading Plan to the terms of Rule 10b5-1 and the execution of transactions pursuant to the Trading Plan are the sole\nresponsibility of the person initiating the Trading Plan, not the Company or the Authorizing Officer.\n11\nTrading Plans do not exempt individuals from complying with Section 16 short-swing profit rules or liability.\nRule 10b5-1 presents an opportunity for insiders to establish arrangements to sell (or purchase) Company stock without the restrictions of trading windows and black-\nout periods, even when there is undisclosed material information. A Trading Plan may also help reduce negative publicity that may result when key executives sell the\nCompany’s stock. Rule 10b5-1 only provides an “affirmative defense” in the event there is an insider trading lawsuit. It does not prevent someone from bringing a lawsuit.\nA director, officer or employee may enter into a Trading Plan only when he or she is not in possession of material, non-public information, and only during a trading\nwindow period outside of the trading black-out period. Although transactions effected under a Trading Plan will not require further pre-clearance at the time of the trade, any\ntransaction (including the quantity and price) made pursuant to a Trading Plan of a Section 16 reporting person must be reported to the Company promptly on the day of each\ntrade to permit the Company’s filing coordinator to assist in the preparation and filing of a required Form 4. Such reporting may be oral or in writing (including by e-mail) and\nshould include the identity of the reporting person, the type of transaction, the date of the transaction, the number of shares involved and the purchase or sale price. However,\nthe ultimate responsibility, and liability, for timely filing remains with the Section 16 reporting person.\nThe Company reserves the right from time to time to suspend, discontinue or otherwise prohibit any transaction in the Company’s securities, even pursuant to a\npreviously approved Trading Plan, if the Authorizing Officer or the Board of Directors, in its discretion, determines that such suspension, discontinuation or other prohibition is\nin the best interests of the Company. Any Trading Plan submitted for approval hereunder should explicitly acknowledge the Company’s right to prohibit transactions in the\nCompany’s securities. Failure to discontinue purchases and sales as directed shall constitute a violation of the terms of this Section VI and result in a loss of the exemption set\nforth herein.\nOfficers, directors and employees may adopt Trading Plans with brokers that outline a pre-set plan for trading of the Company’s stock, including the exercise of\noptions. Trades pursuant to a Trading Plan generally may occur at any time. However, the Company requires a cooling-off period of 30 days between the establishment of a\nTrading Plan and commencement of any transactions under such plan. An individual may adopt more than one Trading Plan. Please review the following description of how a\nTrading Plan works.\nPursuant to Rule 10b5-1, an individual’s purchase or sale of securities will not be “on the basis of” material, non-public information if:\n● First, before becoming aware of the information, the individual enters into a binding contract to purchase or sell the securities, provides instructions to another\nperson to sell the securities or adopts a written plan for trading the securities (i.e., the Trading Plan).\n● Second, the Trading Plan must either:\n● specify the amount of securities to be purchased or sold, the price at which the securities are to be purchased or sold and the date on which the\nsecurities are to be purchased or sold;\n● include a written formula or computer program for determining the amount, price and date of the transactions; or\n12\n● prohibit the individual from exercising any subsequent influence over the purchase or sale of the Company’s stock under the Trading Plan in\nquestion.\n● Third, the purchase or sale must occur pursuant to the Trading Plan and the individual must not enter into a corresponding hedging transaction or alter or\ndeviate from the Trading Plan.\nFor clarity, the requirements of this Section VI.A do not apply to any Trading Plan entered into by a venture capital partnership or other similar entity with which a\ndirector is affiliated. It is the responsibility of each such venture capital partnership or other entity, in consultation with their own counsel (as appropriate), to comply with\napplicable securities laws in connection with any Trading Plan.\n2. Revocation of and Amendments to Trading Plans\nRevocation of Trading Plans should occur only in unusual circumstances. Effectiveness of any revocation or amendment of a Trading Plan will be subject to the prior\nreview and approval of the Authorizing Officer. Revocation is effected upon written notice to the broker. Once a Trading Plan has been revoked, the participant should wait at\nleast 30 days before trading outside of a Trading Plan and 180 days before establishing a new Trading Plan.\nA person acting in good faith may amend a prior Trading Plan so long as such amendments are made outside of a quarterly trading black-out period and at a time when\nthe Trading Plan participant does not possess material, non-public information. Plan amendments must not take effect for at least 30 days after the plan amendments are made.\nUnder certain circumstances, a Trading Plan must be revoked. This may include circumstances such as the announcement of a merger or the occurrence of an event\nthat would cause the transaction either to violate the law or to have an adverse effect on the Company. The Authorizing Officer or administrator of the Company’s stock plans is\nauthorized to notify the broker in such circumstances, thereby insulating the insider in the event of revocation.\n3. Discretionary Plans\nAlthough non-discretionary Trading Plans are preferred, discretionary Trading Plans, where the discretion or control over trading is transferred to a broker, are\npermitted if pre-approved by the Authorizing Officer.\nThe Authorizing Officer of the Company must pre-approve any Trading Plan, arrangement or trading instructions, etc., involving potential sales or purchases of the\nCompany’s stock or option exercises, including but not limited to, blind trusts, discretionary accounts with banks or brokers, or limit orders. The actual transactions effected\npursuant to a pre-approved Trading Plan will not be subject to further pre-clearance for transactions in the Company’s stock once the Trading Plan or other arrangement has\nbeen pre-approved.\n4. Reporting (if Required)\nIf required, an SEC Form 144 will be filled out and filed by the individual/brokerage firm in accordance with the existing rules regarding Form 144 filings. A footnote\nat the bottom of the Form 144 should indicate that the trades “are in accordance with a Trading Plan that complies with Rule 10b5-1 and expires ____.” For Section 16\nreporting persons, Form 4s should be filed before the end of the second business day following the date that the broker, dealer or plan administrator informs the individual that a\ntransaction was executed, provided that the date of such notification is not later than the third business day following the trade date. A similar footnote should be placed at the\nbottom of the Form 4 as outlined above.\n13\n5. Options\nExercises of options for cash may be executed at any time. “Cashless exercise” option exercises through a broker are subject to trading windows. However, the\nCompany will permit same day sales under Trading Plans. If a broker is required to execute a cashless exercise in accordance with a Trading Plan, then the Company must have\nexercise forms attached to the Trading Plan that are signed, undated and with the number of shares to be exercised left blank. Once a broker determines that the time is right to\nexercise the option and dispose of the shares in accordance with the Trading Plan, the broker will notify the Company in writing and the administrator of the Company’s stock\nplans will fill in the number of shares and the date of exercise on the previously signed exercise form. The insider should not be involved with this part of the exercise.\n6. Trades Outside of a Trading Plan\nDuring an open trading window, trades differing from Trading Plan instructions that are already in place are allowed as long as the Trading Plan continues to be\nfollowed.\n7. Public Announcements\nThe Company may make a public announcement that Trading Plans are being implemented in accordance with Rule 10b5-1. It will consider in each case whether a\npublic announcement of a particular Trading Plan should be made. It may also make public announcements or respond to inquiries from the media as transactions are made\nunder a Trading Plan.\n8. Prohibited Transactions\nThe transactions prohibited under Section V of this Policy, including among others short sales and hedging transactions, may not be carried out through a Trading Plan\nor other arrangement or trading instruction involving potential sales or purchases of the Company’s securities.\n9. Limitation on Liability\nNone of the Company, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Authorizing Officer, the Company’s other employees or any other person will have\nany liability for any delay in reviewing, or refusal of, a Trading Plan submitted pursuant to this Section VI or a request for pre-clearance submitted pursuant to Section IV of\nthis Policy. Notwithstanding any review of a Trading Plan pursuant to this Section VI or pre-clearance of a transaction pursuant to Section IV of this Policy, none of the\nCompany, the Chief Financial Officer, the Authorizing Officer, the Company’s other employees or any other person assumes any liability for the legality or consequences of\nsuch Trading Plan or transaction to the person engaging in or adopting such Trading Plan or transaction.\n14\nB. Section 16: Insider Reporting Requirements, Short-Swing Profits and Short Sales\n1. Reporting Obligations Under Section 16(a): SEC Forms 3, 4 and 5\nSection 16(a) of the 1934 Act generally requires all officers, directors and 10% stockholders (“insiders”), within 10 days after the insider becomes an officer, director\nor 10% stockholder, to file with the SEC an “Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities” on SEC Form 3 listing the amount of the Company’s stock, options and\nwarrants which the insider beneficially owns. Following the initial filing on SEC Form 3, changes in beneficial ownership of the Company’s stock, options and warrants must\nbe reported on SEC Form 4, generally within two business days after the date on which such change occurs, or in certain cases on Form 5, within 45 days after fiscal year end.\nA Form 4 must be filed even if, as a result of balancing transactions, there has been no net change in holdings. In certain situations, purchases or sales of Company stock made\nwithin six months prior to the filing of a Form 3 must be reported on Form 4. Similarly, certain purchases or sales of Company stock made within six months after an officer or\ndirector ceases to be an insider must be reported on Form 4.\n2. Recovery of Profits Under Section 16(b)\nFor the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by an insider, any profits realized by any officer, director or 10%\nstockholder from any “purchase” and “sale” of Company stock during a six-month period, so called “short-swing profits,” may be recovered by the Company. When such a\npurchase and sale occurs, good faith is no defense. The insider is liable even if compelled to sell for personal reasons, and even if the sale takes place after full disclosure and\nwithout the use of any inside information.\nThe liability of an insider under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act is only to the Company itself. The Company, however, cannot waive its right to short swing profits, and\nany Company stockholder can bring suit in the name of the Company. Reports of ownership filed with the SEC on Form 3, Form 4 or Form 5 pursuant to Section 16(a)\n(discussed above) are readily available to the public, and certain attorneys carefully monitor these reports for potential Section 16(b) violations. In addition, liabilities under\nSection 16(b) may require separate disclosure in the Company’s annual report to the SEC on Form 10-K or its proxy statement for its annual meeting of stockholders. No suit\nmay be brought more than two years after the date the profit was realized. However, if the insider fails to file a report of the transaction under Section 16(a), as required, the\ntwo-year limitation period does not begin to run until after the transactions giving rise to the profit have been disclosed. Failure to report transactions and late filing of reports\nrequire separate disclosure in the Company’s proxy statement.\nOfficers and directors should consult the attached “Short-Swing Profit Rule Section 16(b) Checklist” attached hereto as “Attachment A” in addition to consulting the\nChief Financial Officer prior to engaging in any transactions involving the Company’s securities, including without limitation, the Company’s stock, options or warrants. The\nCompany’s employees who are not officers, directors or insiders may disregard Attachment A.\n3. Short Sales Prohibited Under Section 16(c)\nSection 16(c) of the 1934 Act prohibits insiders absolutely from making short sales of the Company’s equity securities. Short sales include sales of stock which the\ninsider does not own at the time of sale, or sales of stock against which the insider does not deliver the shares within 20 days after the sale. Under certain circumstances, the\npurchase or sale of put or call options, or the writing of such options, can result in a violation of Section 16(c). Insiders violating Section 16(c) face criminal liability.\nThe Chief Financial Officer should be consulted if you have any questions regarding reporting obligations, short-swing profits or short sales under Section 16.\n15\nC. Rule 144\nRule 144 provides a safe harbor exemption to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for certain resales of “restricted securities” and\n“control securities.” “Restricted securities” are securities acquired from an issuer, or an affiliate of an issuer, in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving a public\noffering. “Control securities” are any securities owned by directors, executive officers or other “affiliates” of the issuer, including stock purchased in the open market and stock\nreceived upon exercise of stock options. Sales of Company restricted and control securities must comply with the requirements of Rule 144, which are summarized below:\n● Holding Period. Restricted securities must be held for at least six months before they may be sold in the market.\n● Current Public Information. The Company must have filed all SEC-required reports during the last 12 months or such shorter period that the Company was\nrequired to file such reports.\n● Volume Limitations. For affiliates, total sales of Company common stock for any three-month period may not exceed the greater of: (i) 1% of the total\nnumber of outstanding shares of Company common stock, as reflected in the most recent report or statement published by the Company, or (ii) the average\nweekly reported volume of such shares traded during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of the requisite Form 144.\n● Method of Sale. For affiliates, the shares must be sold either in a “broker’s transaction” or in a transaction directly with a “market maker.” A “broker’s\ntransaction” is one in which the broker does no more than execute the sale order and receive the usual and customary commission. Neither the broker nor the\nselling person can solicit or arrange for the sale order. In addition, the selling person or Board member must not pay any fee or commission other than to the\nbroker. A “market maker” includes a specialist permitted to act as a dealer, a dealer acting in the position of a block positioner, and a dealer who holds himself\nout as being willing to buy and sell Company common stock for his own account on a regular and continuous basis.\n● Notice of Proposed Sale. For affiliates, a notice of the sale (a Form 144) may be required to be filed with the SEC at the time of the sale. Brokers generally\nhave internal procedures for executing sales under Rule 144 and will assist you in completing the Form 144 and in complying with the other requirements of\nRule 144.\nIf you are subject to Rule 144, you must instruct your broker who handles trades in Company securities to follow the brokerage firm’s Rule 144 compliance\nprocedures in connection with all trades.\nVII. EXECUTION AND RETURN OF CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE\nAfter reading this Policy, all officers, directors and employees should execute and return to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer the Certification of Compliance\nform attached hereto as “Attachment B.”\n16\nATTACHMENT A\nSHORT-SWING PROFIT RULE SECTION 16(B) CHECKLIST\nNote: ANY combination of PURCHASE AND SALE or SALE AND PURCHASE within six months of each other by an officer, director or 10% stockholder (or any\nfamily member living in the same household or certain affiliated entities) results in a violation of Section 16(b), and the “profit” must be recovered by Bullfrog AI Holdings,\nInc. (the “Company”). It makes no difference how long the shares being sold have been held or, for officers and directors, that you were an insider for only one of the two\nmatching transactions. The highest priced sale will be matched with the lowest priced purchase within the six-month period.\nSales\nIf a sale is to be made by an officer, director or 10% stockholder (or any family member living in the same household or certain affiliated entities):\n1. Have there been any purchases by the insider (or family members living in the same household or certain affiliated entities) within the past six months?\n2. Have there been any option grants or exercises not exempt under Rule 16b-3 within the past six months?\n3. Are any purchases (or non-exempt option exercises) anticipated or required within the next six months?\n4. Has a Form 4 been prepared?\nNote: If a sale is to be made by an affiliate of the Company, has a Form 144 been prepared and has the broker been reminded to sell pursuant to Rule 144?\nPurchases And Option Exercises\nIf a purchase or option exercise for Company stock is to be made:\n1. Have there been any sales by the insider (or family members living in the same household or certain affiliated entities) within the past six months?\n2. Are any sales anticipated or required within the next six months (such as tax-related or year-end transactions)?\n3. Has a Form 4 been prepared?\nBefore proceeding with a purchase or sale, consider whether you are aware of material, non-public information which could affect the price of the Company\nstock. All transactions in the Company’s securities by officers and directors must be pre-cleared by contacting the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, or such person\nperforming duties similar to those performed by a Chief Financial Officer.\nATTACHMENT B\nCERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE\nRETURN BY WEDNESDAY, 31 JANUARY\nTO: Dane Saglio, Chief Financial Officer\nFROM: __________________________\nRE: INSIDER TRADING COMPLIANCE POLICY OF BULLFROG AI HOLDINGS, INC.\nI have received, reviewed and understand the above-referenced Insider Trading Compliance Policy and undertake, as a condition to my present and continued\nemployment with (or, if I am not an employee, affiliation with) Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc., to comply fully with the policies and procedures contained therein.\nI hereby certify, to the best of my knowledge, that during the calendar year ending December 31, 2023, I have complied fully with all policies and procedures\nset forth in the above-referenced Insider Trading Compliance Policy.\n___________________________ _______________\nSIGNATURE DATE\n___________________________\nTITLE\nExhibit 23.1\nCONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nWe hereby consent to the incorporation in Registration Statement on Form S-1 No. 333-267951 of our report dated March 29, 2024, of BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc. relating to\nthe audit of the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and for the periods then ended, and the reference to our firm under the caption “Experts”\nin the Registration Statement.\n/s/ M&K CPA’s, PLLC\nHouston, TX\nMarch 29, 2024\nExhibit 31.1\nCertification of\nPrincipal Executive Officer\nof BULLFROG AI HOLDINGS, INC.\nPursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nI, Vininder Singh, certify that:\n1.

(the “Company”) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the “Report”), each of the undersigned officers of the Company certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as adopted\npursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to such officer’s knowledge:\n(1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and\n(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of the dates and for the\nperiods expressed in the Report.\nDated: March 29, 2024 By: /s/ Vininder Singh\nVininder Singh\nChief Executive Officer\n(Principal Executive Officer)\nDated: March 29, 2024 By: /s/ Dane Saglio\nDane Saglio\nChief Financial Officer\n(Principal Financial and Accounting Officer)\nExhibit 97\nBULLFROG AI HOLDINGS, INC.\nCOMPENSATION RECOUPMENT POLICY\n1. Restatement. In the event of any required accounting restatement of the financial statements of Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) due to the material\nnoncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the applicable U.S. federal securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to\ncorrect an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error\nwere corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “Restatement”), the Company will recover reasonably promptly from any person who is or was\nan “Executive Officer,” as such term is defined in Rule 10D-1 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 5608 of the\nNasdaq listing rules, of the Company (each, a “Covered Person”) the amount of any “Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation” (as defined below). This Policy is\neffective as of October 2, 2023, the effective date of Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq listing rules (the “Effective Date”).\n2. Amount. The amount of Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined below) that must be recovered from a Covered Person pursuant to the immediately preceding\nparagraph is the amount of “Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation” (as defined below) received by a Covered Person that exceeds the amount of Recoverable Incentive-\nBased Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid (referred to as\nthe “Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation”). For Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the\namount of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the amount must be\nbased on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return, as applicable, upon which the Recoverable Incentive-Based\nCompensation was received, and the Company must maintain documentation of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC\n(“Nasdaq”). For the purposes of this Policy, Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation will be deemed to be received in the fiscal period during which the financial reporting\nmeasure specified in the applicable Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant occurs after the end of that period.\n3. Definitions:\n(a) “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a “financial\nreporting measure,” which means a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which are used in preparing the\nCompany’s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also financial reporting\nmeasures for this purpose. For avoidance of doubt, a financial reporting measure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission.\n(b) “Recoverable Incentive-Based Compensation” means all Incentive-Based Compensation received on or after the Effective Date of this Policy set forth\nabove by a Covered Person: (i) after beginning service as an executive officer; (ii) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for the\nIncentive-Based Compensation; (iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association; and (iv) during the\nthree completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, including any applicable transition period that results from\na change in the Company’s fiscal year within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. For this purpose, the Company is deemed to be required to prepare a\nRestatement on the earlier of: (i) the date the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), or the Company’s officers authorized to take such action if Board action is not\nrequired, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement; and (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized\nbody directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. The Company’s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is not dependent on if or when\nthe restated financial statements are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n4. Recovery. The Company must recover the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation from Covered Persons unless the Board determines that recovery is\nimpracticable because: (i) the direct expense to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation;\nprovided that, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation before concluding that recovery is\nimpracticable, document such reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation and provide such documentation to Nasdaq; or (ii)\nrecovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the applicable\nrequirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\n5. No Indemnification. In no event will the Company indemnify any Covered Person for any amounts that are recovered under this Policy. This Policy is in addition to\n(and not in lieu of) any right of repayment, forfeiture or right of offset against any employees that is required pursuant to any statutory repayment requirement (regardless of\nwhether implemented at any time prior to or following the adoption or amendment of this Policy), including Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any amounts paid\nto the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will be considered in determining any amounts recovered under this Policy.\n6. Other Company Rights. The application and enforcement of this Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce a Covered Person’s\nobligations to the Company, including termination of employment or institution of legal proceedings. Nothing in this Policy restricts the Company from seeking recoupment\nunder any other compensation recoupment Policy or any applicable provisions in plans, agreements, awards or other arrangements that contemplate the recoupment of\ncompensation from a Covered Person. If a Covered Person fails to repay Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation that is owed to the Company under this Policy,\nthe Company must take all appropriate action to recover any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation from the Covered Person, and the Covered Person will be\nrequired to reimburse the Company for all expenses (including legal expenses) incurred by the Company in recovering the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based\nCompensation.\n7. Binding Effect. The terms of this Policy will be binding and enforceable against all Covered Persons subject to this Policy and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors,\nadministrators or other legal representatives. If any provision of this Policy or the application of such provision to any Covered Person is adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions\nwill be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision (or the application of such provision) valid, legal or enforceable.\n2\n8. Acknowledgement by Employee. Each Covered Person must sign and return to the Company, within 30 calendar days following the later of (i) the Effective Date of\nthis Policy first set forth above or (ii) the date the individual becomes a Covered Person, the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which the\nCovered Person agrees to be bound by, and to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Policy.\n9. Interpretation. This Policy will be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act, Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq listing rules and any\nrelated rules or regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or Nasdaq (the “Applicable Rules”) as well as any other applicable law. To the extent the\nApplicable Rules require recovery of incentive-based compensation in additional circumstances beyond those specified above, nothing in this Policy will be deemed to limit or\nrestrict the right or obligation of the Company to recover incentive-based compensation to the fullest extent required by the Applicable Rules.\nAdopted as of December 1, 2023\n3\nEXHIBIT A\nBULLFROG AI HOLDINGS, INC.\nCOMPENSATION RECOUPMENT POLICY\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM\nBy signing below, the undersigned acknowledges and confirms that the undersigned has received and reviewed a copy of the Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc.
