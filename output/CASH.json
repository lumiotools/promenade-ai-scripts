Announces Results for 2024 Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024\n\n10/23/2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s201.q4cdn.com/819850033/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/4Q2024-Press-Release-Pathward-Financial.pdf)\n\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Pathward Financial, Inc. (“Pathward Financial” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CASH) reported net income of $33.6 million, or $1.35 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $35.9 million, or $1.36 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nThe Company reported net income of $168.4 million, or $6.62 per share, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $163.6 million, or $5.99 per share, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized return on average assets of 2.20% compared to 2.33% for the prior year period. \n\nCEO Brett Pharr said, “2024 was a great year for Pathward. We recertified as a Great Place to Work, remained committed to our remote first approach, announced new partnerships and extended others, celebrated employees who won multiple awards, and, most recently, announced that our newly rebranded Partner Solutions team won Finovate’s Best Banking as a Service provider. These successes translated to solid financial results as well. We reported earnings per diluted share of $6.62 for the fiscal year, which was just above the high end of our updated guidance range and represents year-over-year growth of 11%.” \n\n**Company Highlights and Business Developments**\n\n  * On August 28, 2024, Pathward announced the sale of its commercial insurance premium finance business. The Company expects this transaction will close by October 31, 2024. \n\n\n  * On September 25, 2024, Pathward, N.A., (“Bank” or “Pathward”), a subsidiary of Pathward Financial, celebrated its 20th year serving the payments industry with the announcement it renamed its \"Banking as a Service\" business line to \"Partner Solutions.\" \n\n\n  * On September 30, 2024, Pathward Financial and Pathward announced the Bank’s Partner Solutions line of business won the 2024 Finovate Award for Best Banking as a Service Provider. According to Finovate, its awards recognize the companies driving fintech innovation forward and the individuals bringing new ideas to life. \n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights for the 2024 Fiscal Fourth Quarter**\n\n  * Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $167.9 million, an increase of $6.9 million, or 4%, compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2023, driven by an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a reduction in noninterest income. \n\n\n  * Net interest margin (\"NIM\") increased 47 basis points to 6.66% for the fourth quarter from 6.19% during the same period last year, primarily driven by increased yields on earning assets and an improved earning asset mix from the continued optimization of the portfolio. When including contractual, rate-related processing expense, which includes the expenses associated with custodial deposits, NIM would have been 5.15% in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter compared to 4.87% during the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. Servicing fee income on off-balance sheet custodial deposits is not included in this calculation. See non-GAAP reconciliation table below. \n\n\n  * Total gross loans and leases at September 30, 2024 decreased $290.9 million to $4.08 billion compared to September 30, 2023 and decreased $537.4 million when compared to June 30, 2024. When excluding insurance premium finance loans of $800.1 million and $617.1 million, respectively, total gross loans and leases at September 30, 2024 increased $509.2 million, or 14%, when compared to September 30, 2023 and increased $79.7 million, or 2%, compared to June 30, 2024. \n\n\n  * During the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 236,308 shares of common stock at an average share price of $63.44. As of September 30, 2024, there were 7,000,000 shares available for repurchase under the current common stock share repurchase program. \n\n\n\n**Net Interest Income**\n\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $115.9 million, an increase of 10% from the same quarter in fiscal 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to increased yields, higher average interest-earning asset balances and an improved earning asset mix. \n\nThe Company’s average interest-earning assets for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 increased by $201.1 million to $6.93 billion compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2023, due to growth in average outstanding balances of loans and leases, partially offset by a decrease in total investment security balances and a decrease in cash balances. The fourth quarter average outstanding balance of loans and leases increased $406.4 million compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in commercial finance and warehouse finance loans, partially offset by a decrease in consumer finance loans. \n\nFiscal 2024 fourth quarter NIM increased to 6.66% from 6.19% in the fourth fiscal quarter of last year. When including contractual, rate-related processing expense, NIM would have been 5.15% in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter compared to 4.87% during the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. See non-GAAP reconciliation table below. The overall reported tax-equivalent yield (“TEY”) on average earning asset yields increased 41 basis points to 6.89% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an improved earning asset mix. The yield on the loan and lease portfolio was 8.67% compared to 8.33% for the comparable period last year and the TEY on the securities portfolio was 3.12% compared to 3.13% over that same period. \n\nThe Company's cost of funds for all deposits and borrowings averaged 0.24% during the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, as compared to 0.29% during the prior year quarter. The Company's overall cost of deposits was 0.07% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, as compared to 0.12% during the prior year quarter. When including contractual, rate-related processing expense, the Company's overall cost of deposits was 1.76% in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, as compared to 1.56% during the prior year quarter. See non-GAAP reconciliation table below. \n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nFiscal 2024 fourth quarter noninterest income decreased 7% to $52.0 million, compared to $56.1 million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in card and deposit fees, rental income, and other income. The period-over-period decrease was partially offset by an increase in gain on sale of other and tax services product fees. \n\nThe period-over-period decrease in card and deposit fee income was primarily related to lower servicing fee income due to a reduction in custodial deposits. Servicing fee income totaled $3.2 million during the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter, compared to $7.8 million for the same period of the prior year. For the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, servicing fee income on custodial deposits totaled $8.6 million. \n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense increased 10% to $129.9 million for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, from $118.2 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation and benefits, card processing expense, other expense, and legal and consulting expense. The period-over-period increase was partially offset by a decrease in operating lease depreciation and amortization expenses. \n\nThe card processing expense increase was due to rate-related agreements with Partner Solutions relationships. The amount of expense paid under those agreements is based on an agreed upon rate index that varies depending on the deposit levels, floor rates, market conditions, and other performance conditions. Generally, this rate index is based on a percentage of the Effective Federal Funds Rate (\"EFFR\") and reprices immediately upon a change in the EFFR. Approximately 57% of the deposit portfolio was subject to these rate-related processing expenses during the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, contractual, rate-related processing expenses were $26.3 million, as compared to $27.6 million for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, and $22.5 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**Income Tax Expense**\n\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $3.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 8.2%, for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, compared to an income tax benefit of $2.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of (7.9%), for the fourth quarter last fiscal year. The current quarter increase in income tax expense compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a decrease in investment tax credits. \n\nThe Company originated $26.1 million in renewable energy leases during the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, resulting in $7.2 million in total net investment tax credits. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company originated $42.6 million in renewable energy leases resulting in $13.7 million in total net investment tax credits. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company originated $68.4 million in renewable energy leases, compared to $93.6 million for the comparable prior year period. Investment tax credits related to renewable energy leases are recognized ratably based on income throughout each fiscal year. \n\n**Investments, Loans and Leases**\n\n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Total investments** |  **$** |  **1,774,313** |  **$** |  **1,759,486** |  **$** |  **1,814,140** |  **$** |  **1,886,021** |  **$** |  **1,840,819**  \n**Loans held for sale**  \nTerm lending  |  4,567  |  —  |  1,977  |  2,500  |  —   \nLease financing  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  778  |  —   \nInsurance premium finance  |  594,359  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nSBA/USDA  |  65,734  |  7,030  |  7,372  |  —  |  —   \nConsumer finance  |  24,210  |  22,350  |  16,597  |  66,240  |  77,779   \n**Total loans held for sale** |  **688,870** |  **29,380** |  **25,946** |  **69,518** |  **77,779**  \nTerm lending  |  1,554,641  |  1,533,722  |  1,489,054  |  1,452,274  |  1,308,133   \nAsset-based lending  |  471,897  |  473,289  |  429,556  |  379,681  |  382,371   \nFactoring  |  362,295  |  350,740  |  336,442  |  335,953  |  358,344   \nLease financing  |  152,174  |  155,044  |  168,616  |  188,889  |  183,392   \nInsurance premium finance  |  —  |  617,054  |  522,904  |  671,035  |  800,077   \nSBA/USDA  |  568,628  |  563,689  |  560,433  |  546,048  |  524,750   \nOther commercial finance  |  185,964  |  166,653  |  149,056  |  160,628  |  166,091   \n**Commercial finance** |  **3,295,599** |  **3,860,191** |  **3,656,061** |  **3,734,508** |  **3,723,158**  \n**Consumer finance** |  **248,800** |  **253,358** |  **267,031** |  **301,510** |  **254,416**  \n**Tax services** |  **8,825** |  **43,184** |  **84,502** |  **33,435** |  **5,192**  \n**Warehouse finance** |  **517,847** |  **449,962** |  **394,814** |  **349,911** |  **376,915**  \n**Total loans and leases** |  **4,071,071** |  **4,606,695** |  **4,402,408** |  **4,419,364** |  **4,359,681**  \nNet deferred loan origination costs  |  4,124  |  5,857  |  6,977  |  6,917  |  6,435   \n**Total gross loans and leases** |  **4,075,195** |  **4,612,552** |  **4,409,385** |  **4,426,281** |  **4,366,116**  \nAllowance for credit losses  |  (45,336  |  )  |  (79,836  |  )  |  (80,777  |  )  |  (53,785  |  )  |  (49,705  |  )   \n**Total loans and leases, net** |  **$** |  **4,029,859** |  **$** |  **4,532,716** |  **$** |  **4,328,608** |  **$** |  **4,372,496** |  **$** |  **4,316,411**  \n  \nThe Company's investment security balances at September 30, 2024 totaled $1.77 billion, as compared to $1.76 billion at June 30, 2024 and $1.84 billion at September 30, 2023. \n\nTotal gross loans and leases totaled $4.08 billion at September 30, 2024, as compared to $4.61 billion at June 30, 2024 and $4.37 billion at September 30, 2023. The primary driver for the sequential and year-over-year decrease was related to the insurance premium finance portfolio moving to held for sale. The decrease was partially offset by growth in total commercial finance loans, excluding insurance premium finance loans, and warehouse finance loans. A decrease in seasonal tax services loans also led to the sequential decrease. When excluding insurance premium finance loans, total gross loans and leases at September 30, 2024 increased $79.7 million, or 2%, compared to June 30, 2024 and increased $509.2 million, or 14%, when compared to September 30, 2023. \n\nCommercial finance loans, which comprised 81% of the Company's loan and lease portfolio, totaled $3.30 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of $564.6 million from June 30, 2024 and a decrease of $427.6 million, or 11%, from September 30, 2023. The sequential decrease in commercial finance loans was primarily driven by the insurance premium finance portfolio moving to held for sale during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which had a balance of $594.4 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease was partially offset by a $20.9 million increase in the term lending portfolio, a $19.3 million increase in the other commercial finance portfolio, and an $11.6 million increase in the factoring portfolio. The decrease in commercial finance loans when comparing the current period to the same period of the prior year was primarily driven by the aforementioned insurance premium finance loans along with a decrease in lease financing. This decrease was partially offset by increases in the term lending, asset-based lending, SBA/USDA, and other commercial finance portfolios. When excluding insurance premium finance loans, commercial finance loans at September 30, 2024 increased $52.5 million, or 2%, compared to June 30, 2024 and increased $372.5 million, or 13%, when compared to September 30, 2023. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") totaled $45.3 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease compared to $79.8 million at June 30, 2024 and a decrease compared to $49.7 million at September 30, 2023. The decrease in the ACL at September 30, 2024, when compared to June 30, 2024, was primarily due to a $28.6 million decrease in the allowance related to the seasonal tax services portfolio, a $3.4 million decrease in the allowance related to the consumer finance portfolio, and $2.5 million decrease in the allowance related to the commercial finance portfolio. \n\nThe $4.4 million year-over-year decrease in the ACL was primarily driven by a $4.4 million decrease in the allowance related to the commercial finance portfolio and a $0.1 million decrease in the allowance related to the consumer finance portfolio, partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in the allowance related to the warehouse finance portfolio. \n\nThe following table presents the Company's ACL as a percentage of its total loans and leases. \n\n**As of the Period Ended**  \n---  \n**(Unaudited)** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nCommercial finance  |  1.29  |  %  |  1.17  |  %  |  1.21  |  %  |  1.30  |  %  |  1.26  |  %   \nConsumer finance  |  0.90  |  %  |  2.23  |  %  |  1.71  |  %  |  1.45  |  %  |  0.92  |  %   \nTax services  |  0.03  |  %  |  66.35  |  %  |  37.31  |  %  |  1.52  |  %  |  0.04  |  %   \nWarehouse finance  |  0.10  |  %  |  0.10  |  %  |  0.10  |  %  |  0.10  |  %  |  0.10  |  %   \n**Total loans and leases** |  1.11  |  %  |  1.73  |  %  |  1.83  |  %  |  1.22  |  %  |  1.14  |  %   \n**Total loans and leases excluding tax services** |  1.12  |  %  |  1.12  |  %  |  1.14  |  %  |  1.21  |  %  |  1.14  |  %   \n  \nThe Company's ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.11% at September 30, 2024 from 1.73% at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the total loans and leases coverage ratio was primarily driven by the consumer finance portfolio and the seasonal tax services portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the commercial finance portfolio. The decrease in the consumer finance loan coverage ratio was due to seasonal activity. The increase in the commercial finance loan and lease coverage ratio was primarily related to the $594.4 million of insurance premium finance loans that were held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and, as such, had no related ACL balance. That portfolio carried a lower reserve rate compared to the rest of the commercial finance portfolio. \n\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses for the periods presented was as follows. \n\n**(Unaudited)** |  **Three Months Ended** |  **Fiscal Year Ended**  \n---|---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**Beginning balance** |  $  |  79,836  |  $  |  80,777  |  $  |  81,916  |  $  |  49,705  |  $  |  45,947   \nProvision (reversal of) - tax services loans  |  (297  |  )  |  (3,285  |  )  |  2,945  |  22,995  |  35,775   \nProvision (reversal of) - all other loans and leases  |  1,423  |  8,926  |  6,124  |  19,243  |  21,673   \nCharge-offs - tax services loans  |  (28,815  |  )  |  (820  |  )  |  (36,606  |  )  |  (30,780  |  )  |  (38,741  |  )   \nCharge-offs - all other loans and leases  |  (7,912  |  )  |  (7,772  |  )  |  (6,227  |  )  |  (26,902  |  )  |  (21,158  |  )   \nRecoveries - tax services loans  |  461  |  1,230  |  531  |  7,785  |  2,963   \nRecoveries - all other loans and leases  |  640  |  780  |  1,022  |  3,290  |  3,246   \n**Ending balance** |  $  |  45,336  |  $  |  79,836  |  $  |  49,705  |  $  |  45,336  |  $  |  49,705   \n  \nThe Company recognized a provision for credit losses of $0.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.0 million for the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The period-over-period decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily due to decreases in provision for credit losses in the commercial finance portfolio of $4.7 million and the tax services portfolio of $3.2 million, partially offset by an increase of $0.1 million in provision for credit losses in the warehouse finance portfolio. The decrease in provision for credit losses in the commercial finance portfolio was primarily due to the insurance premium finance portfolio moving to held for sale during the quarter and reversing out the provision for credit losses on that portfolio. The Company recognized net charge-offs of $35.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $41.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs attributable to the seasonal tax services, consumer finance, and commercial finance portfolios for the current quarter were $28.4 million, $3.9 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. Net charge-offs attributable to the tax services, commercial finance and consumer finance portfolios for the same quarter of the prior year were $36.1 million, $5.1 million, and $0.1 million, respectively. \n\nThe Company's past due loans and leases were as follows for the periods presented. \n\n**As of September 30, 2024** |  **Accruing and Nonaccruing Loans and Leases** |  **Nonperforming Loans and Leases**  \n---|---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **30-59 Days Past Due** |  **60-89 Days Past Due** |  **> 89 Days Past Due** |  **Total Past Due** |  **Current** |  **Total Loans and Leases Receivable** |  **> 89 Days Past Due and Accruing** |  **Nonaccrual Balance** |  **Total**  \n**Loans held for sale** |  $  |  2,266  |  $  |  1,361  |  $  |  1,050  |  $  |  4,677  |  $  |  684,193  |  $  |  688,870  |  $  |  1,050  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  1,050   \n**Commercial finance** |  23,381  |  7,671  |  19,975  |  51,027  |  3,244,572  |  3,295,599  |  2,314  |  26,412  |  28,726   \n**Consumer finance** |  3,962  |  3,186  |  3,053  |  10,201  |  238,599  |  248,800  |  3,053  |  —  |  3,053   \n**Tax services** |  —  |  —  |  8,733  |  8,733  |  92  |  8,825  |  8,733  |  —  |  8,733   \n**Warehouse finance** |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  517,847  |  517,847  |  —  |  —  |  —   \n**Total loans and leases held for investment** |  27,343  |  10,857  |  31,761  |  69,961  |  4,001,110  |  4,071,071  |  14,100  |  26,412  |  40,512   \n**Total loans and leases** |  $  |  29,609  |  $  |  12,218  |  $  |  32,811  |  $  |  74,638  |  $  |  4,685,303  |  $  |  4,759,941  |  $  |  15,150  |  $  |  26,412  |  $  |  41,562   \n**As of June 30, 2024** |  **Accruing and Nonaccruing Loans and Leases** |  **Nonperforming Loans and Leases**  \n---|---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **30-59 Days Past Due** |  **60-89 Days Past Due** |  **> 89 Days Past Due** |  **Total Past Due** |  **Current** |  **Total Loans and Leases Receivable** |  **> 89 Days Past Due and Accruing** |  **Nonaccrual Balance** |  **Total**  \n**Loans held for sale** |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  29,380  |  $  |  29,380  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —   \n**Commercial finance** |  28,224  |  7,348  |  17,071  |  52,643  |  3,807,548  |  3,860,191  |  8,427  |  27,613  |  36,040   \n**Consumer finance** |  4,496  |  3,534  |  8,588  |  16,618  |  236,740  |  253,358  |  8,588  |  —  |  8,588   \n**Tax services** |  —  |  43,184  |  —  |  43,184  |  —  |  43,184  |  —  |  —  |  —   \n**Warehouse finance** |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  449,962  |  449,962  |  —  |  —  |  —   \n**Total loans and leases held for investment** |  32,720  |  54,066  |  25,659  |  112,445  |  4,494,250  |  4,606,695  |  17,015  |  27,613  |  44,628   \n**Total loans and leases** |  $  |  32,720  |  $  |  54,066  |  $  |  25,659  |  $  |  112,445  |  $  |  4,523,629  |  $  |  4,636,074  |  $  |  17,015  |  $  |  27,613  |  $  |  44,628   \n  \nThe Company's nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 were $43.0 million, representing 0.57% of total assets, compared to $46.3 million, or 0.61% of total assets at June 30, 2024 and $58.0 million, or 0.77% of total assets at September 30, 2023. \n\nThe decrease in the nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease in nonperforming loans in the commercial finance and consumer finance portfolios, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming loans in the tax services portfolio due to seasonal activity. When comparing the current period to the same period of the prior year, the decrease in nonperforming assets was primarily due to decreases in nonperforming loans in the commercial finance portfolio, partially offset by increases in the seasonal tax services portfolio and consumer finance portfolio. \n\nThe Company's nonperforming loans and leases at September 30, 2024, were $41.6 million, representing 0.87% of total gross loans and leases, compared to $44.6 million, or 0.96% of total gross loans and leases at June 30, 2024 and $56.2 million, or 1.26% of total gross loans and leases at September 30, 2023. \n\nThe Company has various portfolios of consumer lending and tax services loans that present unique risks that are statistically managed. Due to the unique risks associated with these portfolios, the Company monitors other credit quality indicators in their evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on these portfolios, and as such, these loans are not included in the asset classification table below. The Company's loans and leases held for investment by asset classification were as follows for the periods presented. \n\n**Asset Classification**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **Pass** |  **Watch** |  **Special Mention** |  **Substandard** |  **Doubtful** |  **Total**  \n**As of September 30, 2024**  \nCommercial finance  |  $  |  2,524,429  |  $  |  486,670  |  $  |  93,257  |  $  |  180,942  |  $  |  10,301  |  $  |  3,295,599   \nWarehouse finance  |  517,847  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  517,847   \n**Total loans and leases** |  $  |  3,042,276  |  $  |  486,670  |  $  |  93,257  |  $  |  180,942  |  $  |  10,301  |  $  |  3,813,446   \n**Asset Classification**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **Pass** |  **Watch** |  **Special Mention** |  **Substandard** |  **Doubtful** |  **Total**  \n**As of June 30, 2024**  \nCommercial finance  |  $  |  3,058,737  |  $  |  537,278  |  $  |  63,523  |  $  |  192,473  |  $  |  8,180  |  $  |  3,860,191   \nWarehouse finance  |  449,962  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  449,962   \n**Total loans and leases** |  $  |  3,508,699  |  $  |  537,278  |  $  |  63,523  |  $  |  192,473  |  $  |  8,180  |  $  |  4,310,153   \n  \n**Deposits, Borrowings and Other Liabilities**\n\nThe average balance of total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities was $6.38 billion for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.39 billion for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Total average deposits for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter decreased by $5.7 million to $6.20 billion compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. The decrease in average deposits was due to decreases in wholesale deposits and savings deposits, partially offset by increases noninterest bearing deposits and money market deposits. \n\nTotal end-of-period deposits decreased 11% to $5.88 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $6.59 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease in end-of-period deposits was primarily driven by decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits of $715.8 million, money market deposits of $10.6 million, and savings deposits of $10.3 million, partially offset by an increase in wholesale deposits of $20.1 million. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $433.3 million in deposits related to government stimulus programs. Of the total amount of government stimulus program deposits, $198.2 million are on activated cards while $235.1 million are on inactivated cards. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company managed $201.9 million of customer deposits at other banks in its capacity as custodian. These deposits provide the Company with the ability to earn servicing fee income, typically reflective of the EFFR. The sequential quarter decrease in these customer deposits held at other banks reflects normal seasonal patterns in deposits on balance sheet as well as the Company retaining more deposits on its balance sheet to fund loan growth by the Company during the current quarter. \n\n**Regulatory Capital**\n\nThe Company and its subsidiary Pathward®, N.A. (the \"Bank\") remained above the federal regulatory minimum capital requirements at September 30, 2024, and continued to be classified as well-capitalized, and in good standing with the regulatory agencies. Regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Bank are stated in the table below. Regulatory capital is not affected by the unrealized loss on accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The securities portfolio is primarily comprised of amortizing securities that should provide consistent cash flow. \n\nThe tables below include certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. Management reviews these measures along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analysis. \n\n**As of the Periods Indicated** |  **September 30, 2024(1) ** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023** |  **September 30,** **2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCompany   \nTier 1 leverage capital ratio  |  9.26  |  %  |  9.13  |  %  |  7.75  |  %  |  7.96  |  %  |  8.11  |  %   \nCommon equity Tier 1 capital ratio  |  12.60  |  %  |  12.44  |  %  |  12.30  |  %  |  11.43  |  %  |  11.25  |  %   \nTier 1 capital ratio  |  12.86  |  %  |  12.70  |  %  |  12.56  |  %  |  11.69  |  %  |  11.50  |  %   \nTotal capital ratio  |  14.08  |  %  |  14.33  |  %  |  14.21  |  %  |  13.12  |  %  |  12.84  |  %   \nBank   \nTier 1 leverage ratio  |  9.44  |  %  |  9.36  |  %  |  7.92  |  %  |  8.15  |  %  |  8.32  |  %   \nCommon equity Tier 1 capital ratio  |  13.12  |  %  |  13.02  |  %  |  12.83  |  %  |  11.97  |  %  |  11.81  |  %   \nTier 1 capital ratio  |  13.12  |  %  |  13.02  |  %  |  12.83  |  %  |  11.97  |  %  |  11.81  |  %   \nTotal capital ratio  |  13.97  |  %  |  14.27  |  %  |  14.09  |  %  |  13.01  |  %  |  12.76  |  %   \n(1) |  September 30, 2024 percentages are preliminary pending completion and filing of the Company's regulatory reports.

You should carefully read statements that contain these words because they discuss our future expectations or state other “forward-looking” information. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and assumptions about future events, and include statements with respect to the Company’s beliefs, expectations, estimates, and intentions, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and are subject to change based on various factors, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual growth, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, performance and business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Such statements address, among others, the following subjects: future operating results including our earnings per diluted share guidance, annual effective tax rate and related performance expectations; progress on key strategic initiatives; expected results of our partnerships; impacts of our improved data analytics, underwriting and monitoring processes; expected nonperforming loan resolutions and net charge off rates; the performance of our securities portfolio; the impact of card balances related to government stimulus programs; customer retention; loan and other product demand; new products and services; credit quality; the level of net charge-offs and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; and technology. The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's financial performance and results of operations to differ materially from the expectations, estimates, and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements: maintaining our executive management team; expected growth opportunities may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the potential adverse effects of unusual and infrequently occurring events, including the impact on financial markets from geopolitical conflicts such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, weather-related disasters, or public health events, such as pandemics, and any governmental or societal responses thereto; our ability to successfully implement measures designed to reduce expenses and increase efficiencies; changes in trade, monetary, and fiscal policies and laws, including actual changes in interest rates and the Fed Funds rate, and their related impacts on macroeconomic conditions, customer behavior, funding costs and loan and securities portfolios; changes in tax laws; the strength of the United States' economy and the local economies in which the Company operates; adverse developments in the financial services industry generally such as bank failures, responsive measures to mitigate and manage such developments, related supervisory and regulatory actions and costs, and related impacts on customer behavior; inflation, market, and monetary fluctuations; our liquidity and capital positions, including the sufficiency of our liquidity; the timely and efficient development of new products and services offered by the Company or its strategic partners, as well as risks (including reputational and litigation) attendant thereto, and the perceived overall value and acceptance of these products and services by users; the Bank's ability to maintain its Durbin Amendment exemption; the risks of dealing with or utilizing third parties, including, in connection with the Company’s prepaid card and tax refund advance businesses, the risk of reduced volume of refund advance loans as a result of reduced customer demand for or usage of the Bank's strategic partners’ refund advance products; our relationship with, and any actions which may be initiated by, our regulators; changes in financial services laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the tax refund industry and the insurance premium finance industry; technological changes, including, but not limited to, the protection of our electronic systems and information; the impact of acquisitions and divestitures; litigation risk; the growth of the Company’s business, as well as expenses related thereto; continued maintenance by the Bank of its status as a well-capitalized institution; changes in consumer borrowing, spending and saving habits; losses from fraudulent or illegal activity; technological risks and developments and cyber threats, attacks, or events; and the success of the Company at maintaining its high quality asset level and managing and collecting assets of borrowers in default should problem assets increase. \n\nThe foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this press release speak only as of the date hereof.

The Company expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update, revise or clarify any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the

(2) Net interest margin expressed on a fully-taxable-equivalent basis (\"net interest margin, tax-equivalent\") is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the estimated income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and adjusting for federal and state exemption of interest income. The Company believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin expressed on a fully taxable equivalent basis and, accordingly, believes the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure may be useful for peer comparison purposes.   \n**Selected Financial Information**  \n---  \n**As of and For the Three Months Ended** |  **September 30,** **2024** |  **June 30,** **2024** |  **March 31,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023** |  **September 30,** **2023**  \nEquity to total assets  |  11.12  |  %  |  10.16  |  %  |  9.94  |  %  |  9.20  |  %  |  8.63  |  %   \nBook value per common share outstanding  |  $  |  33.79  |  $  |  30.51  |  $  |  29.14  |  $  |  28.06  |  $  |  24.85   \nTangible book value per common share outstanding  |  $  |  20.67  |  $  |  17.47  |  $  |  16.21  |  $  |  15.39  |  $  |  12.24   \nCommon shares outstanding  |  24,847,353  |  25,085,230  |  25,377,986  |  25,988,230  |  26,183,583   \nNonperforming assets to total assets  |  0.57  |  %  |  0.61  |  %  |  0.50  |  %  |  0.53  |  %  |  0.77  |  %   \nNonperforming loans and leases to total loans and leases  |  0.87  |  %  |  0.96  |  %  |  0.78  |  %  |  0.88  |  %  |  1.26  |  %   \nNet interest margin  |  6.66  |  %  |  6.56  |  %  |  6.23  |  %  |  6.23  |  %  |  6.19  |  %   \nNet interest margin, tax-equivalent  |  6.67  |  %  |  6.57  |  %  |  6.24  |  %  |  6.24  |  %  |  6.21  |  %   \nReturn on average assets  |  1.79  |  %  |  2.28  |  %  |  3.17  |  %  |  1.46  |  %  |  1.97  |  %   \nReturn on average equity  |  16.80  |  %  |  22.62  |  %  |  35.72  |  %  |  16.87  |  %  |  21.12  |  %   \nReturn on average tangible equity  |  28.40  |  %  |  40.59  |  %  |  64.92  |  %  |  33.95  |  %  |  41.15  |  %   \nFull-time equivalent employees  |  1,241  |  1,232  |  1,204  |  1,218  |  1,193   \n**Non-GAAP Reconciliations**  \n---  \n**Net Interest Margin and Cost of Deposits** |  **At and For the Three Months Ended**  \n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nAverage interest earning assets  |  $  |  6,925,315  |  $  |  6,801,888  |  $  |  6,724,185   \nNet interest income  |  $  |  115,922  |  $  |  110,859  |  $  |  104,934   \nNet interest margin  |  6.66  |  %  |  6.56  |  %  |  6.19  |  %   \nQuarterly average total deposits  |  $  |  6,199,271  |  $  |  6,260,990  |  $  |  6,204,934   \nDeposit interest expense  |  $  |  1,119  |  $  |  1,689  |  $  |  1,954   \nCost of deposits  |  0.07  |  %  |  0.11  |  %  |  0.12  |  %   \n**Adjusted Net Interest Margin and Adjusted Cost of Deposits**  \nAverage interest earning assets  |  $  |  6,925,315  |  $  |  6,801,888  |  $  |  6,724,185   \nNet interest income  |  115,922  |  110,859  |  104,934   \nLess: Contractual, rate-related processing expense  |  26,274  |  27,595  |  22,473   \nAdjusted net interest income  |  $  |  89,648  |  $  |  83,264  |  $  |  82,461   \nAdjusted net interest margin  |  5.15  |  %  |  4.92  |  %  |  4.87  |  %   \nAverage total deposits  |  $  |  6,199,271  |  $  |  6,260,990  |  $  |  6,204,934   \nDeposit interest expense  |  1,119  |  1,689  |  1,954   \nAdd: Contractual, rate-related processing expense  |  26,274  |  27,595  |  22,473   \nAdjusted deposit expense  |  $  |  27,393  |  $  |  29,284  |  $  |  24,427   \nAdjusted cost of deposits  |  1.76  |  %  |  1.88  |  %  |  1.56  |  %   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241023397948r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact** Darby Schoenfeld, CPA SVP, Chief of Staff & Investor Relations 877-497-7497 investorrelations@pathward.com  **Media Relations Contact** mediarelations@pathward.com\n\nSource: Pathward Financial, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://pathwardfinancial.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Contact Us\n\n[877-497-7497](tel:877-497-7497) Send Email\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://pathwardfinancial.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://pathwardfinancial.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://pathwardfinancial.com/resources/information-request-form/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

(“Pathward Financial” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:\nCASH) reported net income of $33.6 million, or $1.35 per share, for the three months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to net income of $35.9 million, or $1.36 per share, for the three months ended September 30,\n2023.\nThe Company reported net income of $168.4 million, or $6.62 per share, for the fiscal year ended September\n30, 2024, compared to net income of $163.6 million, or $5.99 per share, for the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2023. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized return on average assets of\n2.20% compared to 2.33% for the prior year period.\nCEO Brett Pharr said, “2024 was a great year for Pathward. We recertified as a Great Place to Work, remained\ncommitted to our remote first approach, announced new partnerships and extended others, celebrated\nemployees who won multiple awards, and, most recently, announced that our newly rebranded Partner\nSolutions team won Finovate’s Best Banking as a Service provider. These successes translated to solid financial\nresults as well. We reported earnings per diluted share of $6.62 for the fiscal year, which was just above the high\nend of our updated guidance range and represents year-over-year growth of 11%.”\nCompany Highlights and Business Developments\n• On August 28, 2024, Pathward announced the sale of its commercial insurance premium finance business.\nThe Company expects this transaction will close by October 31, 2024.\n• On September 25, 2024, Pathward, N.A., (“Bank” or “Pathward”), a subsidiary of Pathward Financial,\ncelebrated its 20th year serving the payments industry with the announcement it renamed its \"Banking as a\nService\" business line to \"Partner Solutions.\"\n• On September 30, 2024, Pathward Financial and Pathward announced the Bank’s Partner Solutions line of\nbusiness won the 2024 Finovate Award for Best Banking as a Service Provider. According to Finovate, its\nawards recognize the companies driving fintech innovation forward and the individuals bringing new ideas\nto life.\nFinancial Highlights for the 2024 Fiscal Fourth Quarter\n• Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $167.9 million, an increase of $6.9 million, or 4%, compared to the\nsame quarter in fiscal 2023, driven by an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a reduction in\nnoninterest income.\n• Net interest margin (\"NIM\") increased 47 basis points to 6.66% for the fourth quarter from 6.19% during the\nsame period last year, primarily driven by increased yields on earning assets and an improved earning asset\nmix from the continued optimization of the portfolio. When including contractual, rate-related processing\nexpense, which includes the expenses associated with custodial deposits, NIM would have been 5.15% in\nthe fiscal 2024 fourth quarter compared to 4.87% during the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. Servicing fee income\non off-balance sheet custodial deposits is not included in this calculation. See non-GAAP reconciliation table\nbelow.\n1\n• Total gross loans and leases at September 30, 2024 decreased $290.9 million to $4.08 billion compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023 and decreased $537.4 million when compared to June 30, 2024. When excluding\ninsurance premium finance loans of $800.1 million and $617.1 million, respectively, total gross loans and\nleases at September 30, 2024 increased $509.2 million, or 14%, when compared to September 30, 2023 and\nincreased $79.7 million, or 2%, compared to June 30, 2024.\n• During the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 236,308 shares of common stock at an\naverage share price of $63.44. As of September 30, 2024, there were 7,000,000 shares available for\nrepurchase under the current common stock share repurchase program.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $115.9 million, an increase of 10% from the same\nquarter in fiscal 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to increased yields, higher average interest-earning\nasset balances and an improved earning asset mix.\nThe Company’s average interest-earning assets for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 increased by $201.1 million\nto $6.93 billion compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2023, due to growth in average outstanding balances of\nloans and leases, partially offset by a decrease in total investment security balances and a decrease in cash\nbalances. The fourth quarter average outstanding balance of loans and leases increased $406.4 million\ncompared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in commercial finance and\nwarehouse finance loans, partially offset by a decrease in consumer finance loans.\nFiscal 2024 fourth quarter NIM increased to 6.66% from 6.19% in the fourth fiscal quarter of last year. When\nincluding contractual, rate-related processing expense, NIM would have been 5.15% in the fiscal 2024 fourth\nquarter compared to 4.87% during the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. See non-GAAP reconciliation table below. The\noverall reported tax-equivalent yield (“TEY”) on average earning asset yields increased 41 basis points to 6.89%\ncompared to the prior year quarter, driven by an improved earning asset mix. The yield on the loan and lease\nportfolio was 8.67% compared to 8.33% for the comparable period last year and the TEY on the securities\nportfolio was 3.12% compared to 3.13% over that same period.\nThe Company's cost of funds for all deposits and borrowings averaged 0.24% during the fiscal 2024 fourth\nquarter, as compared to 0.29% during the prior year quarter. The Company's overall cost of deposits was 0.07%\nin the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, as compared to 0.12% during the prior year quarter. When including\ncontractual, rate-related processing expense, the Company's overall cost of deposits was 1.76% in the fiscal\n2024 fourth quarter, as compared to 1.56% during the prior year quarter. See non-GAAP reconciliation table\nbelow.\nNoninterest Income\nFiscal 2024 fourth quarter noninterest income decreased 7% to $52.0 million, compared to $56.1 million for the\nsame period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in card and deposit fees, rental\nincome, and other income. The period-over-period decrease was partially offset by an increase in gain on sale of\nother and tax services product fees.\nThe period-over-period decrease in card and deposit fee income was primarily related to lower servicing fee\nincome due to a reduction in custodial deposits. Servicing fee income totaled $3.2 million during the 2024 fiscal\nfourth quarter, compared to $7.8 million for the same period of the prior year. For the fiscal quarter ended June\n30, 2024, servicing fee income on custodial deposits totaled $8.6 million.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased 10% to $129.9 million for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, from $118.2 million for\nthe same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation and benefits,\ncard processing expense, other expense, and legal and consulting expense. The period-over-period increase\nwas partially offset by a decrease in operating lease depreciation and amortization expenses.\n2\nThe card processing expense increase was due to rate-related agreements with Partner Solutions relationships.\nThe amount of expense paid under those agreements is based on an agreed upon rate index that varies\ndepending on the deposit levels, floor rates, market conditions, and other performance conditions. Generally,\nthis rate index is based on a percentage of the Effective Federal Funds Rate (\"EFFR\") and reprices immediately\nupon a change in the EFFR. Approximately 57% of the deposit portfolio was subject to these rate-related\nprocessing expenses during the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024,\ncontractual, rate-related processing expenses were $26.3 million, as compared to $27.6 million for the fiscal\nquarter ended June 30, 2024, and $22.5 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $3.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 8.2%, for the\nfiscal 2024 fourth quarter, compared to an income tax benefit of $2.7 million, representing an effective tax rate\nof (7.9%), for the fourth quarter last fiscal year. The current quarter increase in income tax expense compared to\nthe prior year quarter was primarily due to a decrease in investment tax credits.\nThe Company originated $26.1 million in renewable energy leases during the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter,\nresulting in $7.2 million in total net investment tax credits. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company\noriginated $42.6 million in renewable energy leases resulting in $13.7 million in total net investment tax credits.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company originated $68.4 million in renewable energy\nleases, compared to $93.6 million for the comparable prior year period. Investment tax credits related to\nrenewable energy leases are recognized ratably based on income throughout each fiscal year.\n3\nInvestments, Loans and Leases\nSeptember 30, December 31, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 2023 2023\nTotal investments $ 1,774,313 $ 1,759,486 $ 1,814,140 $ 1,886,021 $ 1,840,819\nLoans held for sale\nTerm lending 4,567 — 1,977 2,500 —\nLease financing — — — 778 —\nInsurance premium finance 594,359 — — — —\nSBA/USDA 65,734 7,030 7,372 — —\nConsumer finance 24,210 22,350 16,597 66,240 77,779\nTotal loans held for sale 688,870 29,380 25,946 69,518 77,779\nTerm lending 1,554,641 1,533,722 1,489,054 1,452,274 1,308,133\nAsset-based lending 471,897 473,289 429,556 379,681 382,371\nFactoring 362,295 350,740 336,442 335,953 358,344\nLease financing 152,174 155,044 168,616 188,889 183,392\nInsurance premium finance — 617,054 522,904 671,035 800,077\nSBA/USDA 568,628 563,689 560,433 546,048 524,750\nOther commercial finance 185,964 166,653 149,056 160,628 166,091\nCommercial finance 3,295,599 3,860,191 3,656,061 3,734,508 3,723,158\nConsumer finance 248,800 253,358 267,031 301,510 254,416\nTax services 8,825 43,184 84,502 33,435 5,192\nWarehouse finance 517,847 449,962 394,814 349,911 376,915\nTotal loans and leases 4,071,071 4,606,695 4,402,408 4,419,364 4,359,681\nNet deferred loan origination costs 4,124 5,857 6,977 6,917 6,435\nTotal gross loans and leases 4,075,195 4,612,552 4,409,385 4,426,281 4,366,116\nAllowance for credit losses (45,336) (79,836) (80,777) (53,785) (49,705)\nTotal loans and leases, net $ 4,029,859 $ 4,532,716 $ 4,328,608 $ 4,372,496 $ 4,316,411\nThe Company's investment security balances at September 30, 2024 totaled $1.77 billion, as compared to $1.76\nbillion at June 30, 2024 and $1.84 billion at September 30, 2023.\nTotal gross loans and leases totaled $4.08 billion at September 30, 2024, as compared to $4.61 billion at\nJune 30, 2024 and $4.37 billion at September 30, 2023. The primary driver for the sequential and year-over-year\ndecrease was related to the insurance premium finance portfolio moving to held for sale. The decrease was\npartially offset by growth in total commercial finance loans, excluding insurance premium finance loans, and\nwarehouse finance loans. A decrease in seasonal tax services loans also led to the sequential decrease. When\nexcluding insurance premium finance loans, total gross loans and leases at September 30, 2024 increased $79.7\nmillion, or 2%, compared to June 30, 2024 and increased $509.2 million, or 14%, when compared to September\n30, 2023.\nCommercial finance loans, which comprised 81% of the Company's loan and lease portfolio, totaled $3.30\nbillion at September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of $564.6 million from June 30, 2024 and a decrease of\n$427.6 million, or 11%, from September 30, 2023. The sequential decrease in commercial finance loans was\nprimarily driven by the insurance premium finance portfolio moving to held for sale during the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2024, which had a balance of $594.4 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease was partially offset by a\n$20.9 million increase in the term lending portfolio, a $19.3 million increase in the other commercial finance\nportfolio, and an $11.6 million increase in the factoring portfolio. The decrease in commercial finance loans\nwhen comparing the current period to the same period of the prior year was primarily driven by the\naforementioned insurance premium finance loans along with a decrease in lease financing. This decrease was\npartially offset by increases in the term lending, asset-based lending, SBA/USDA, and other commercial finance\n4\nportfolios. When excluding insurance premium finance loans, commercial finance loans at September 30, 2024\nincreased $52.5 million, or 2%, compared to June 30, 2024 and increased $372.5 million, or 13%, when\ncompared to September 30, 2023.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") totaled $45.3 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease\ncompared to $79.8 million at June 30, 2024 and a decrease compared to $49.7 million at September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in the ACL at September 30, 2024, when compared to June 30, 2024, was primarily due to a $28.6\nmillion decrease in the allowance related to the seasonal tax services portfolio, a $3.4 million decrease in the\nallowance related to the consumer finance portfolio, and $2.5 million decrease in the allowance related to the\ncommercial finance portfolio.\nThe $4.4 million year-over-year decrease in the ACL was primarily driven by a $4.4 million decrease in the\nallowance related to the commercial finance portfolio and a $0.1 million decrease in the allowance related to the\nconsumer finance portfolio, partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in the allowance related to the warehouse\nfinance portfolio.\nThe following table presents the Company's ACL as a percentage of its total loans and leases.\nAs of the Period Ended\nSeptember June 30, March 31, December September\n(Unaudited) 30, 2024 2024 2024 31, 2023 30, 2023\nCommercial finance 1.29 % 1.17 % 1.21 % 1.30 % 1.26 %\nConsumer finance 0.90 % 2.23 % 1.71 % 1.45 % 0.92 %\nTax services 0.03 % 66.35 % 37.31 % 1.52 % 0.04 %\nWarehouse finance 0.10 % 0.10 % 0.10 % 0.10 % 0.10 %\nTotal loans and leases 1.11 % 1.73 % 1.83 % 1.22 % 1.14 %\nTotal loans and leases excluding tax services 1.12 % 1.12 % 1.14 % 1.21 % 1.14 %\nThe Company's ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.11% at September 30, 2024 from\n1.73% at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the total loans and leases coverage ratio was primarily driven by the\nconsumer finance portfolio and the seasonal tax services portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the\ncommercial finance portfolio. The decrease in the consumer finance loan coverage ratio was due to seasonal\nactivity. The increase in the commercial finance loan and lease coverage ratio was primarily related to the $594.4\nmillion of insurance premium finance loans that were held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and, as such, had\nno related ACL balance. That portfolio carried a lower reserve rate compared to the rest of the commercial\nfinance portfolio.\n5\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses for the periods presented was as follows.\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember June 30, September September September\n(Dollars in thousands) 30, 2024 2024 30, 2023 30, 2024 30, 2023\nBeginning balance $ 79,836 $ 80,777 $ 81,916 $ 49,705 $ 45,947\nProvision (reversal of) - tax services loans (297) (3,285) 2,945 22,995 35,775\nProvision (reversal of) - all other loans and\nleases 1,423 8,926 6,124 19,243 21,673\nCharge-offs - tax services loans (28,815) (820) (36,606) (30,780) (38,741)\nCharge-offs - all other loans and leases (7,912) (7,772) (6,227) (26,902) (21,158)\nRecoveries - tax services loans 461 1,230 531 7,785 2,963\nRecoveries - all other loans and leases 640 780 1,022 3,290 3,246\nEnding balance $ 45,336 $ 79,836 $ 49,705 $ 45,336 $ 49,705\nThe Company recognized a provision for credit losses of $0.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $9.0 million for the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The period-over-period decrease in\nprovision for credit losses was primarily due to decreases in provision for credit losses in the commercial finance\nportfolio of $4.7 million and the tax services portfolio of $3.2 million, partially offset by an increase of $0.1 million\nin provision for credit losses in the warehouse finance portfolio. The decrease in provision for credit losses in the\ncommercial finance portfolio was primarily due to the insurance premium finance portfolio moving to held for\nsale during the quarter and reversing out the provision for credit losses on that portfolio. The Company\nrecognized net charge-offs of $35.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-\noffs of $41.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs attributable to the seasonal tax\nservices, consumer finance, and commercial finance portfolios for the current quarter were $28.4 million, $3.9\nmillion, and $3.3 million, respectively. Net charge-offs attributable to the tax services, commercial finance and\nconsumer finance portfolios for the same quarter of the prior year were $36.1 million, $5.1 million, and $0.1\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company's past due loans and leases were as follows for the periods presented.\nAs of September 30,\n2024 Accruing and Nonaccruing Loans and Leases Nonperforming Loans and Leases\n> 89 Days\n30-59 60-89 > 89 Total Loans Past Due\nDays Past Days Past Days Past Total Past and Leases and Nonaccrual\n(Dollars in thousands) Due Due Due Due Current Receivable Accruing Balance Total\nLoans held for sale $ 2,266 $ 1,361 $ 1,050 $ 4,677 $ 684,193 $ 688,870 $ 1,050 $ — $ 1,050\nCommercial finance 23,381 7,671 19,975 51,027 3,244,572 3,295,599 2,314 26,412 28,726\nConsumer finance 3,962 3,186 3,053 10,201 238,599 248,800 3,053 — 3,053\nTax services — — 8,733 8,733 92 8,825 8,733 — 8,733\nWarehouse finance — — — — 517,847 517,847 — — —\nTotal loans and leases\nheld for investment 27,343 10,857 31,761 69,961 4,001,110 4,071,071 14,100 26,412 40,512\nTotal loans and leases $ 29,609 $ 12,218 $ 32,811 $ 74,638 $ 4,685,303 $ 4,759,941 $ 15,150 $ 26,412 $ 41,562\n6\nAs of June 30, 2024 Accruing and Nonaccruing Loans and Leases Nonperforming Loans and Leases\n> 89 Days\n30-59 60-89 > 89 Total Loans Past Due\nDays Past Days Past Days Past Total Past and Leases and Nonaccrual\n(Dollars in thousands) Due Due Due Due Current Receivable Accruing Balance Total\nLoans held for sale $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 29,380 $ 29,380 $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial finance 28,224 7,348 17,071 52,643 3,807,548 3,860,191 8,427 27,613 36,040\nConsumer finance 4,496 3,534 8,588 16,618 236,740 253,358 8,588 — 8,588\nTax services — 43,184 — 43,184 — 43,184 — — —\nWarehouse finance — — — — 449,962 449,962 — — —\nTotal loans and leases\nheld for investment 32,720 54,066 25,659 112,445 4,494,250 4,606,695 17,015 27,613 44,628\nTotal loans and leases $ 32,720 $ 54,066 $ 25,659 $ 112,445 $ 4,523,629 $ 4,636,074 $ 17,015 $ 27,613 $ 44,628\nThe Company's nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 were $43.0 million, representing 0.57% of total\nassets, compared to $46.3 million, or 0.61% of total assets at June 30, 2024 and $58.0 million, or 0.77% of total\nassets at September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in the nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to\nJune 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease in nonperforming loans in the commercial finance and\nconsumer finance portfolios, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming loans in the tax services portfolio\ndue to seasonal activity. When comparing the current period to the same period of the prior year, the decrease\nin nonperforming assets was primarily due to decreases in nonperforming loans in the commercial finance\nportfolio, partially offset by increases in the seasonal tax services portfolio and consumer finance portfolio.\nThe Company's nonperforming loans and leases at September 30, 2024, were $41.6 million, representing 0.87%\nof total gross loans and leases, compared to $44.6 million, or 0.96% of total gross loans and leases at June 30,\n2024 and $56.2 million, or 1.26% of total gross loans and leases at September 30, 2023.\nThe Company has various portfolios of consumer lending and tax services loans that present unique risks that\nare statistically managed. Due to the unique risks associated with these portfolios, the Company monitors other\ncredit quality indicators in their evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on these\nportfolios, and as such, these loans are not included in the asset classification table below.

Total\naverage deposits for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter decreased by $5.7 million to $6.20 billion compared to the\nsame period in fiscal 2023. The decrease in average deposits was due to decreases in wholesale deposits and\nsavings deposits, partially offset by increases noninterest bearing deposits and money market deposits.\nTotal end-of-period deposits decreased 11% to $5.88 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $6.59 billion\nat September 30, 2023. The decrease in end-of-period deposits was primarily driven by decreases in\nnoninterest-bearing deposits of $715.8 million, money market deposits of $10.6 million, and savings deposits of\n$10.3 million, partially offset by an increase in wholesale deposits of $20.1 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $433.3 million in deposits related to government stimulus\nprograms. Of the total amount of government stimulus program deposits, $198.2 million are on activated cards\nwhile $235.1 million are on inactivated cards.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company managed $201.9 million of customer deposits at other banks in its\ncapacity as custodian. These deposits provide the Company with the ability to earn servicing fee income,\ntypically reflective of the EFFR. The sequential quarter decrease in these customer deposits held at other banks\nreflects normal seasonal patterns in deposits on balance sheet as well as the Company retaining more deposits\non its balance sheet to fund loan growth by the Company during the current quarter.\nRegulatory Capital\nThe Company and its subsidiary Pathward®, N.A. (the \"Bank\") remained above the federal regulatory minimum\ncapital requirements at September 30, 2024, and continued to be classified as well-capitalized, and in good\nstanding with the regulatory agencies. Regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Bank are stated in the\ntable below. Regulatory capital is not affected by the unrealized loss on accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (“AOCI”). The securities portfolio is primarily comprised of amortizing securities that should provide\nconsistent cash flow.\nThe tables below include certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by investors, analysts and bank\nregulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. Management reviews these\nmeasures along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analysis.\nSeptember June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\nAs of the Periods Indicated 30, 2024(1) 2024 2024 2023 2023\nCompany\nTier 1 leverage capital ratio 9.26 % 9.13 % 7.75 % 7.96 % 8.11 %\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital ratio 12.60 % 12.44 % 12.30 % 11.43 % 11.25 %\nTier 1 capital ratio 12.86 % 12.70 % 12.56 % 11.69 % 11.50 %\nTotal capital ratio 14.08 % 14.33 % 14.21 % 13.12 % 12.84 %\nBank\nTier 1 leverage ratio 9.44 % 9.36 % 7.92 % 8.15 % 8.32 %\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital ratio 13.12 % 13.02 % 12.83 % 11.97 % 11.81 %\nTier 1 capital ratio 13.12 % 13.02 % 12.83 % 11.97 % 11.81 %\nTotal capital ratio 13.97 % 14.27 % 14.09 % 13.01 % 12.76 %\n(1) September 30, 2024 percentages are preliminary pending completion and filing of the Company's regulatory reports.

At September 30, 2024, the Company’s loans and\nleases receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, totaled $4.03 billion, or 53% of the Company’s total assets, as compared to $4.32 billion, or\n57%, at September 30, 2023.\n4\nTable of Contents\nLoan and lease applications are initially considered and approved at various levels of authority, depending on the type and amount of the loan or\nlease as directed by the Bank's lending policies.

These products include term lending, asset-based lending, factoring, lease financing,\ninsurance premium finance, government guaranteed lending, and other commercial finance products offered on a nationwide basis.\nTerm Lending. The Bank originates a variety of collateralized conventional term loans and notes receivable. While terms range from three years\nto 12 years, the weighted average life of these loans is approximately 59 months. These term loans may be secured by equipment, recurring\nrevenue streams, or real estate. Credit risk is managed through setting loan amounts appropriate for the collateral based on information\nincluding equipment cost, appraisals, valuations, and lending history. The Bank follows standardized loan policies and established and\nauthorized credit limits and applies attentive portfolio management, which includes monitoring past dues, financial performance, financial\ncovenants, and industry trends. As of September 30, 2024, 41% of the term lending portfolio exposure is concentrated in solar/alternative\nenergy, most of which are construction projects that will convert to longer term government guaranteed facilities upon completion of the\nconstruction phase. Equipment finance agreements make up 39% of the term lending total as of September 30, 2024. The remaining 20% are a\nvariety of other general purpose commercial loans.\nAsset-Based Lending. The Bank provides asset-based loans secured by short-term assets such as accounts receivable and inventory. Asset-\nbased loans may also be secured by equipment supported by third party independent appraisals. The primary sources of repayment are the\ncollection of the receivables and/or the sale of the inventory securing the loan, as well as the operating income of the borrower. Loans are\ntypically revolving lines of credit with terms of one year to three years. Credit risk is managed through advance rates appropriate for the collateral\n(generally, advance rates on accounts receivable ranges from 80% to 90% and inventory advance rates range from 40% to 60%). In certain\ncases, inventory advances are supported by the third party independent appraisals. Collateral is further supported and verified via field audits\nconducted up to three times per year. All asset-based facilities have standardized loan policies, established and authorized credit limits, attentive\nportfolio management and the use of lock box agreements and similar arrangements which result in the Company receiving and controlling the\ndebtors' cash receipts. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 65% of asset-based loans were backed by accounts receivable.\nFactoring. The Bank provides factoring lending where customers provide detailed accounts receivable reporting for lending arrangements. The\nfactoring customers are diversified as to industry and geography. With these loans, the Commercial Finance business lends a percentage of\neligible accounts receivable invoices. Advance rates generally range between 80% and 95%. Credit risk is managed through standardized\nadvance policies, established and authorized credit limits, verification of receivables, attentive portfolio management and the use of lock box\nagreements and similar arrangements which result in the Company receiving and controlling the customer's cash receipts. In addition,\ncustomers generally guarantee the payment of purchased accounts receivable.\nLease Financing. The Bank provides creative, flexible lease solutions for equipment needs of its customers. Leases that transfer substantially all\nof the benefits and risks of ownership to the lessee are accounted for as sales-type or direct financing leases. The lease may contain provisions\nthat transfer ownership to the lessee at the end of the initial term, contain a bargain purchase option or allow for purchase of the equipment at\nfair market value. Residual values are estimated at the inception of the lease. Lease maturities are generally no greater than 84 months.\nInsurance Premium Finance. Effective on the Closing Date of the commercial insurance premium finance business sale to AFS IBEX Financial\nServices, LLC, the Company no longer holds or originates insurance premium finance loans. Until the Closing Date, the Bank provided, on a\nnational basis, short-term, primarily collateralized financing to facilitate the commercial customers’ purchase of insurance for various forms of\nrisk, otherwise known as insurance premium financing. This included, but was not limited to, policies for commercial property, casualty and\nliability risk. Premiums were advanced either directly to the insurance carrier or through an intermediary/broker and repaid by the policyholder\nwith interest during the policy term. The policyholder generally made a 20% to 25% down payment to the insurance broker and financed the\nremainder over nine to 10 months on average. The down payment was set such that if the policy is canceled, the unearned premium was\ntypically sufficient to cover the loan balance and accrued interest and was returned by the insurer to the Bank on a pro rata basis. Over 95% of\nthe portfolio finances policies were provided by investment grade-rated insurance company partners.\n7\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Guaranteed Lending. The Bank originates loans through programs partially guaranteed by the SBA or USDA. SBA loans are made\nto small businesses and professionals. Generally, the Bank provides USDA loans to alternative energy project developers and the hotel industry.\nCertain guaranteed portions of these loans may be sold to the secondary market. See \"Originations, Sales and Servicing of Loans and Leases\"\nbelow for further details.\nOther Commercial Finance. Included in this category of loans are the Company's healthcare receivables loan portfolio primarily comprised of\nloans to individuals for medical services received. The majority of these loans are guaranteed by the hospital providing the service to the debtor\nand this guarantee serves to reduce credit risk as the guarantors agree to repurchase severely delinquent loans. Credit risk is minimized on\nthese loans based on the guarantor’s repurchase agreement. This loan category also includes commercial real estate loans.\nConsumer Finance\nThe Bank offers a variety of installment and revolving consumer lending products through its credit solutions. The Bank designs its credit\nprogram relationships with certain desired outcomes, including liquidity, credit protection, and risk retention by the program partner. The Bank\nbelieves the benefits of these outcomes not only support its goals but the goals of the credit program partner as well. The Bank designs its\nprogram credit protections in a manner so that the Bank earns a reasonable risk adjusted return, but is protected by certain layers of credit\nsupport, similar to what you would find in structured finance. Certain loans are sold to third parties based on terms and conditions within the\nProgram Agreement. See \"Originations, Sales and Servicing of Loans and Leases\" below for further details.\nTax Services\nThe Bank's Partner Solutions business line offers professional tax solutions, which includes short-term refund advance loans and short-term\nelectronic return originator (\"ERO\") advance loans.\nRefund Advance Loans. Refund advance loans are unsecured loans to taxpayers that are determined to be eligible based on underwriting\ncriteria designed for this product. Due to the nature of refund advance loans, it typically takes no more than three e-file cycles (the period of time\nbetween scheduled IRS payments) from when the return is accepted by the IRS to collect from the borrower. In the event of default, the Bank\nhas no recourse against the taxpayer. When collection of principal becomes doubtful, the Bank will charge off the balance of a refund advance\nloan on September 30. Any remaining balances are charged off at the end of the calendar year. The Bank may record recoveries of previously\ncharged off loans if collected in subsequent tax years.\nERO Advance Loans. ERO advance loans are unsecured advances that are typically utilized by tax preparers to purchase tax preparation\nsoftware and to prepare tax office operations for the upcoming tax season. EROs go through an underwriting process to determine eligibility.\nCollection on ERO advances begins once the ERO begins to process refund transfers. Generally, the Bank will charge off the balance of an\nERO advance loan if there is a balance at the end of June, or when collection of principal becomes doubtful.\nWarehouse Finance\nThe Bank participates in several collateral-based warehouse lines of credit whereby the Bank is in a senior, secured position as the first out\nparticipant. These facilities are primarily collateralized by consumer receivables, with the Bank holding a senior collateral position enhanced by a\nsubordinate party structure.\nOriginations, Sales and Servicing of Loans and Leases\nThe Company, from time to time, sells loans and leases, and in some cases, loan participations, generally without recourse. At September 30,\n2024, there were no outstanding loans sold by the Company with recourse. When loans or leases are sold, the Company may retain the\nresponsibility for collecting and remitting loan payments, making certain that escrow payments are made on behalf of borrowers, and otherwise\nservicing the loans. The servicing fee is recognized as income over the life of the loans. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was servicing\n$350.7 million of SBA/USDA loans and $13.8 million of term lending loans.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThe Company may sell the guaranteed portion of its SBA 7(a) loans and USDA program loans in the secondary market. These sales have\nresulted in gains for the Company at the time of sale and created a stream of future servicing income. When the Company sells the guaranteed\nportion of its loans, it retains credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and, if a customer defaults on the loan, the Company shares\nany loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA or USDA, as applicable. If the SBA or USDA establishes that a loss on a\nguaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by the\nCompany, the SBA or USDA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from the Company, which could materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn October 31, 2024, as part of the insurance premium finance business sale, the Company sold $588.4 million of commercial insurance\npremium finance loans. See Note 20.

In addition, the Company’s ability\nto sell loans may substantially decrease if potential buyers reduce their purchasing activities.\nThe following table shows the loan and lease originations (including draws, loan and lease renewals, and undisbursed portions of loans and\nleases in process), purchases, and sales and repayment activities of the Company for the periods indicated.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nOriginations\nCommercial finance $ 11,691,809 $ 11,268,857\nConsumer finance 2,535,736 1,842,021\nTax services 1,596,136 1,493,109\nTotal loans and leases originated 15,823,681 14,603,987\nPurchases\nCommercial finance 13,782 480\nWarehouse finance 284,480 212,706\nTotal loans and leases purchased 298,262 213,186\nSales and Repayments\nSales:\nCommercial finance 99,005 16,610\nConsumer finance 1,937,079 1,123,271\nTotal loans and leases sales 2,036,084 1,139,881\nRepayments:\nLoan and lease principal repayments 13,759,262 12,798,879\nTotal principal repayments 13,759,262 12,798,879\nTotal reductions 15,795,346 13,938,760\nIncrease (decrease) in other items, net (2,058) 4,348\nNet increase $ 324,539 $ 882,761\n9\nTable of Contents\nNonperforming Assets, Other Loans and Leases of Concern and Classified Assets\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s loan and lease delinquencies by type, by amount and by percentage of type at September 30,\n2024.\n30-59 Days 60-89 Days > 89 Days Past Due\nNumber of Percent of Number of Percent of Number of Percent of\n(Dollars in thousands) Loans Amount Category Loans Amount Category Loans Amount Category\nLoans held for sale 236 $ 2,266 7.7 % 170 $ 1,361 11.1 % 760 $ 1,050 3.2 %\nCommercial finance 128 23,381 79.0 % 140 7,671 62.8 % 329 19,975 60.9 %\nConsumer finance 2,064 3,962 13.3 % 805 3,186 26.1 % 754 3,053 9.3 %\nTax services (1) — — — % — — — % — 8,733 26.6 %\nWarehouse finance — — — % — — — % — — — %\nTotal loans and leases held for\ninvestment 2,192 $ 27,343 92.3 % 945 $ 10,857 88.9 % 1,083 $ 31,761 96.8 %\nTotal loans and leases 2,428 $ 29,609 100.0 % 1,115 $ 12,218 100.0 % 1,843 $ 32,811 100.0 %\n(1) The tax services loans past due represented the aggregate remaining balance of the tax services loan portfolio.\nDelinquencies 90 days and over constituted 0.69% of total loans and leases and 0.43% of total assets.\nGenerally, when a loan or lease becomes delinquent 90 days or more or when the collection of principal or interest becomes doubtful, the\nCompany will place the loan or lease on a non-accrual status and, as a result, previously accrued interest income on the loan or lease is\nreversed against current income. The loan or lease will generally remain on a non-accrual status until six months of good payment history has\nbeen established or management believes the financial status of the borrower has been significantly restored. Certain relationships in the table\nabove are over 90 days past due and still accruing. The Company considers these relationships as being in the process of collection. Insurance\npremium finance loans, consumer finance and tax services loans are generally not placed on non-accrual status, but are instead written off when\nthe collection of principal and interest become doubtful.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe table below sets forth the amounts and categories of the Company’s nonperforming assets.\nAt September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nNonperforming Loans and Leases\nNonaccruing loans and leases:\nCommercial finance $ 26,412 $ 37,372\nTotal nonaccruing loans and leases 26,412 37,372\nAccruing loans and leases delinquent 90 days or more:\nLoans held for sale 1,050 306\nCommercial finance 2,314 11,242\nConsumer finance 3,053 2,210\nTax services(1) 8,733 5,082\nTotal accruing loans and leases delinquent 90 days or more 15,150 18,840\nTotal nonperforming loans and leases 41,562 56,212\nOther Assets\nNonperforming operating leases 1,471 1,764\nTotal other assets 1,471 1,764\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 43,033 $ 57,976\nTotal as a percentage of total assets 0.57 % 0.77 %\n(1) Certain tax services loans do not bear interest.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, gross interest income, which would have been recorded had the nonaccruing loans and leases\nbeen current in accordance with their original terms, was insignificant, none of which was included in interest income.\nNonaccruing Loans and Leases. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $26.4 million in nonaccruing loans and leases, which constituted\n0.6% of the Company's gross loan and lease portfolio. At September 30, 2023, the Company had $37.4 million in nonaccruing loans which\nconstituted 0.8% of its gross loan and lease portfolio. The fiscal 2024 decrease in nonaccruing loans and leases was primarily driven by one\nsizable relationship within the commercial finance portfolio that was nonaccrual during the prior period and not reported as such as of September\n30, 2024.\nAccruing Loans and Leases Delinquent 90 Days or More. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $15.2 million in accruing loans and leases\ndelinquent 90 days or more, compared to $18.8 million at September 30, 2023. The decrease in the balance of accruing loans and leases 90\ndays or more past due was primarily within the commercial finance portfolio, partially offset by increases within the consumer finance and\nseasonal tax services portfolios.\nFor information on classified assets, see “Item 7.

The\nCompany's ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.11% at September 30, 2024 from 1.14% at September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease in the total loan and lease coverage ratio was primarily driven by decreases in the loan and lease coverage ratios for the consumer\nfinance portfolio and the seasonal tax services portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the loan and lease coverage ratio for the commercial\nfinance portfolio. The increase in the commercial finance loan and lease coverage ratio was primarily related to the $594.4 million of insurance\npremium finance loans that were held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and, as such, had no related ACL balance. That portfolio carried a lower\nreserve rate compared to the rest of the commercial finance portfolio. The Company expects to continue to diligently monitor the ACL and adjust\nas necessary in future periods to maintain an appropriate and supportable level.\nManagement believes that, based on a detailed review of the loan and lease portfolio, historic loan and lease losses, current economic\nconditions, the size of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, the level of the ACL at September 30, 2024 reflected an appropriate\nallowance against expected credit losses from the lending portfolio. Although the Company maintains its ACL at a level it considers to be\nappropriate, investors and others are cautioned that there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts, or that\nadditional provisions for loan and lease losses will not be required in future periods.\nInvestment Activities\nThe investment policy of the Company generally is to invest funds among various categories of investments and maturities based upon the\nCompany’s need for liquidity, to achieve the proper balance between its desire to minimize risk and maximize yield, to provide collateral for\nborrowings and to fulfill the Company’s asset/liability management policies. The Company’s portfolio is managed in accordance with a written\ninvestment policy, which is implemented by members of the Company’s Asset/Liability Committee. The Company closely monitors balances in\nthese accounts and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid assets to fund potential deposit outflows or other liquidity needs. To date, the Company\nhas not experienced any unexpected significant outflows related to the Partner Solutions business line deposits, though no assurance can be\ngiven that this will continue to be the case.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had total investment securities with an amortized cost of $1.98 billion compared to $2.18 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, $1.57 billion, or 79.3%, of the Company’s investment securities were pledged to secure various\nobligations of the Company. Many of the Company’s municipal holdings are able to be pledged at either the Federal Reserve bank (\"FRB\") or the\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (\"FHLB\").\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") portfolio consists of securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or by non-agencies.\nMBS have uncertain cash flow characteristics that present additional interest rate risk in the form of prepayment or extension risk primarily\ncaused by changes in market interest rates. The prepayment risk associated with MBS is continually monitored, and prepayment rate\nassumptions are adjusted as appropriate to update the Company’s MBS accounting and asset/liability reports.\nThe following table sets forth the carrying value of the Company’s portfolio at the dates indicated.\nAt September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nSecurities Available for Sale (\"AFS\")\nCorporate securities $ 19,750 $ 18,250\nSBA securities 81,935 85,242\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 480 2,289\nNon-bank qualified obligations of states and political subdivisions 217,990 226,723\nAsset-backed securities 189,698 246,199\nMortgage-backed securities 1,231,368 1,225,525\nTotal debt securities AFS 1,741,221 1,804,228\nSecurities Held to Maturity (\"HTM\")\nNon-bank qualified obligations of states and political subdivisions 31,060 34,415\nMortgage-backed securities 2,032 2,176\nTotal debt securities HTM 33,092 36,591\nFRB and FHLB stock 36,014 28,210\nTotal securities and FRB and FHLB stock $ 1,810,327 $ 1,869,029\nOther Interest-Earning Assets\nInterest bearing deposits in other financial institutions and federal funds sold(1) $ 106,672 $ 262,225\n(1) From time to time, the Company maintains balances in excess of insured limits at various financial institutions, including the FRB, the FHLB,\nand other private institutions. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $104.9 million and $1.7 million in interest bearing deposits held at\nthe FRB and FHLB, respectively. At September 30, 2023, the Company had $260.3 million and $1.9 million in interest bearing deposits held\nat the FRB and FHLB, respectively.\nThe fair value of debt securities available for sale (\"AFS\") decreased $63.0 million at September 30, 2024 when compared to September 30,\n2023 while the amortized cost of debt securities held to maturity (\"HTM\") decreased $3.5 million over the same period. These decreases were\nprimarily driven by reductions in SBA securities, non-bank qualified obligations of state and political subdivisions, and asset-backed securities,\npartially offset by an increase in MBS.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the contractual maturities of debt securities AFS and HTM at September 30, 2024.

The actual maturity\nof an MBS is typically less than its stated contractual maturity due to scheduled principal payments and prepayments of the underlying\nmortgages. Prepayments that are different than anticipated will affect the yield to maturity. The yield is based upon the interest income and the\namortization of any premium or discount related to the MBS. In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”),\npremiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans, which decrease and increase interest income, respectively. The\nprepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of MBS, and\nthese assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments. Although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many\nfactors, including the type of mortgages, the coupon rate, borrower credit scores, loan to premises value, the age of mortgages, the geographical\nlocation of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates, the difference between the interest\nrates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of\nprepayments. During periods of falling mortgage interest rates, if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market\ninterest rates offered for mortgage loans, refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the\nrelated security. Under such circumstances, the Company may be subject to reinvestment risk because, to the extent that the Company’s MBS\namortize or prepay faster than anticipated, the Company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of such repayments and prepayments at a\ncomparable rate. During periods of rising interest rates, these prepayments tend to decelerate as the prevailing market interest rates for\nmortgage rates increase and prepayment incentives dissipate.\nUnder ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and\nsubsequent related ASUs (collectively, \"Topic 326\") debt securities HTM are subject to an allowance for credit losses that reflects expected credit\nlosses over the life of the financial asset, unless management concludes there is a zero risk of loss. The Company’s HTM debt security portfolio\nis limited to investments with implicit and explicit guarantees by government agencies. As a result, management has concluded a zero risk of\nloss associated with these securities and no provision for credit loss has been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nUnder Topic 326, debt securities AFS continue to be recorded at fair value but are subject to an allowance for credit losses that reflects the\nportion of an unrealized loss position related to credit factors. Any such credit loss is recorded in the Company’s Provision for Credit Loss on the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. Non-credit related losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income in the Company’s\nConsolidated Statement of Condition. The adoption of CECL was inconsequential to debt securities AFS.\nEquity Securities. The Company holds marketable equity securities, which have readily determinable fair values, and include common equity and\nmutual funds. These securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, due to changes in fair value, reflected in earnings.\nInterest and dividend income from these securities is recognized in interest income. See Note 2. Securities for additional information on\nmarketable equity securities.\nThe Company also holds non-marketable equity investments and accounts for them under the equity method, fair value, or the measurement\nalternative method depending on the level of significant influence the Company can exercise and the availability of fair value. All income or loss\nrecognition or fair value adjustments, regardless of measurement methodology, are reflected in earnings as non-interest income. Non-\nmarketable equity investments measured under the equity method, or the measurement alternative method are reviewed for impairment each\nreporting period and are reported in earnings if applicable.\nFunding Activities\nThe Company’s sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, amortization and repayment of loan and lease principal, interest earned on or\nmaturation of securities and funds provided from operations.\nBorrowings, including FHLB advances, overnight federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, other short-term borrowings, and funds\navailable through the FRB Discount Window, may be used at times to compensate for seasonal reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less\nthan projected levels, may be used to compensate for short-term delays in deposit funding, may be used on a longer-term basis to support\nexpanded lending activities, and may also be used to match the funding of a corresponding asset.\n16\nTable of Contents\nDeposits\nThe Company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms. The Company’s deposits primarily consist of\ndemand deposit accounts, savings accounts, and money market savings accounts, many of which are related to the Partner Solutions business\nline. In addition, the Company may periodically utilize brokered or other wholesale deposits to target strategic maturities related to its seasonal\nrefund advance lending. The refund advance lending season typically lasts six weeks or less and it is generally more efficient to fund these\nshort-term loans by using brokered deposits to match the expected repayment from refunds. Other sources of wholesale deposits may also be\nutilized periodically to take advantage of balance sheet funding opportunities.\nThe flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, and competition.\nThe variety of deposit accounts offered by the Company has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to\nchanges in consumer demand. The Company endeavors to manage the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset/liability management and\nprofitability objectives. Based on its experience, the Company believes that deposits related to the Partner Solutions business line are relatively\nstable sources of deposits. However, the ability of the Company to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits has been\nand will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.\nDuring fiscal years 2020 and 2021, in partnership with the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (“Fiscal Service”), the\nBank issued 16.5 million prepaid cards in conjunction with the three Economic Impact Payment (\"EIP\") stimulus programs, totaling approximately\n$24.15 billion. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $433.3 million in deposits related to government stimulus funds. Of the total amount\nof government stimulus program deposits, $198.2 million are on activated cards while $235.1 million are on inactivated cards.\nAt September 30, 2024, $5.64 billion of the Company’s $5.88 billion deposit portfolio was attributable to the Consumer segment. The majority of\nthese deposits represent funds available to spend on prepaid debit cards and other stored value products, of which $5.59 billion are included\nwith noninterest-bearing checking accounts and $47.5 million are included with savings deposits on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition. The Partner Solutions business line originates debit card programs through outside sales agents and other financial\ninstitutions. As such, these deposits carry a somewhat higher degree of concentration risk than traditional consumer products. If a major\ncustomer or card program were to leave the Bank, deposit outflows could be more significant than if the Bank were to lose a more traditional\ncustomer, although it is considered unlikely that all deposits related to a program would leave the Bank without significant advance\nnotification. As such, and as historical results indicate, the Company believes that its deposit portfolio attributable to the Consumer segment is\nstable. Deposits arising from the Partner Solutions business line has allowed the Bank to reduce its reliance on wholesale deposits, certificates\nof deposit and public funds, which typically have relatively higher costs.\nFor information on noninterest-bearing checking deposits, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operation - Financial Condition\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nApproximately 57% of the deposit portfolio during the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter was subject to variable, rate-related processing expenses that\nare derived from the terms of contractual agreements with certain Partner Solutions relationships. These agreements are tied to a rate index,\ntypically the Effective Federal Funds Rate (\"EFFR\").\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the dollar amount of deposits in the various types of deposit programs offered by the Company for the periods\nindicated.\nAt September 30,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percent of Total Amount Percent of Total\nTransactions and Savings Deposits:\nNon-Interest bearing checking $ 5,617,097 95.6 % $ 6,332,941 96.1 %\nInterest bearing checking 4,350 0.1 % 415 — %\nSavings deposits 48,730 0.8 % 59,041 0.9 %\nMoney market deposits 174,701 3.0 % 185,307 2.8 %\nWholesale deposits 1,001 — % 5,944 0.1 %\nTotal transactions and savings deposits 5,845,879 99.5 % 6,583,648 99.9 %\nTime Certificates of Deposit:\nTotal time certificates of deposit(1) 29,206 0.5 % 5,534 0.1 %\nTotal deposits $ 5,875,085 100.0 % $ 6,589,182 100.0 %\n(1) As of September 30, 2024, total time certificates of deposit included $25.0 million of wholesale certificates of deposit.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, total deposits that exceed FDIC insurance limits, or are otherwise uninsured, were estimated to be $643.3\nmillion and $550.7 million, respectively.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operation – Financial Condition” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBorrowings\nAlthough deposits are the Company’s primary source of funds, the Company’s practice has been to utilize borrowings when they are a less\ncostly source of funds, can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, or when the Company desires additional capacity to fund loan demand.\nBorrowings from various sources mature based on stated payment schedules.\nThe Company’s borrowings have historically consisted primarily of advances from the FHLB upon the security of a blanket collateral agreement\nof a percentage of unencumbered loans and the pledge of specific securities. Such advances can be made pursuant to several different credit\nprograms, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had $257.0 million overnight\nborrowings with the ability to borrow up to an approximate additional $726.6 million from the FHLB.\nAs of September 30, 2024, debt securities with fair values of approximately $533.8 million and $1.04 billion were pledged as collateral to the\nFRB and the FHLB, respectively, to secure various obligations of the Company. For additional information regarding the Company’s\ncollateralization of borrowings, see Note 10. Short-term and Long-term Borrowings to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which is\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn September 26, 2022, the Company announced the completion of a private placement of $20 million of its 6.625% Fixed-to-Floating Rate\nSubordinated Notes due 2032 to certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors. The Notes are intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital\nfor regulatory capital purposes. The Notes were issued under an indenture with UMB Bank, N.A., as trustee. At September 30, 2024, $19.7\nmillion in aggregate principal amount in subordinated debentures were outstanding.\nOn July 16, 2001, the Company issued all of the 10,310 authorized shares of Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities\nof First Midwest Financial Capital Trust I (preferred securities of subsidiary trust) holding solely trust preferred securities. Distributions are paid\nsemiannually. Cumulative cash distributions are calculated at 6-month CME Term SOFR plus 0.42826% tenor spread adjustment plus 3.75%,\nnot to exceed 12.5%. The Company may, at one or more times, defer interest payments on the capital securities for up to 10 consecutive semi-\nannual periods, but not beyond July 25, 2031. At the end of any deferral period, all accumulated and unpaid distributions must be paid. The\ncapital securities are required to be redeemed on July 25, 2031; however, the Company has a semiannual option to shorten the maturity date.\nThe option has not been exercised as of the date of this filing. The redemption price is $1,000 per capital security plus any accrued and unpaid\ndistributions to the date of redemption. Holders of the capital securities have no voting rights, are unsecured, and rank junior in priority of\npayment to all of the Company’s indebtedness and senior to the Company’s common stock. The trust preferred securities have been includable\nin the Company’s capital since they were issued. The preferential capital treatment of the Company’s trust preferred securities was\ngrandfathered under the Dodd-Frank Act and is consistent with federal community bank capital rules.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThrough the Crestmark Acquisition, the Company acquired $3.4 million in floating rate capital securities due to Crestmark Capital Trust I, a\n100%-owned nonconsolidated subsidiary of the Company. The subordinated debentures bear interest at 3-month CME Term SOFR plus\n0.26161% tenor spread adjustment plus 3.00%, have a stated maturity of 30 years from the date of issuance and are redeemable by the\nCompany at par, with regulatory approval. The interest rate is reset quarterly at distribution dates in February, May, August, and November. The\nsubsidiary has the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed five\nconsecutive years.\nThe outstanding balance of the trust preferred securities at September 30, 2024 was $13.7 million.\nThe following table sets forth the maximum month-end balance and average balance of trust preferred securities, subordinated debentures,\novernight fed funds purchased, and other borrowings for the periods indicated.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nMaximum Balance:\nTrust preferred securities $ 13,661 $ 13,661\nSubordinated debentures 19,693 19,626\nOvernight fed funds purchased 377,000 440,000\nOther borrowings 523 2,178\nAverage Balance:\nTrust preferred securities $ 13,661 $ 13,661\nSubordinated debentures 19,638 19,560\nOvernight fed funds purchased 99,290 74,812\nOther borrowings 201 1,447\nThe following table sets forth certain information as to the Company’s trust preferred securities, subordinated debentures, overnight fed funds\npurchased, and other borrowings.\nAt September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nTrust preferred securities $ 13,661 $ 13,661\nSubordinated debentures 19,693 19,591\nOvernight fed funds purchased 377,000 13,000\nOther borrowings — 621\nTotal borrowings $ 410,354 $ 46,873\nWeighted average interest rate of trust preferred securities 8.91 % 9.39 %\nWeighted average interest rate of subordinated debentures 6.63 % 6.63 %\nWeighted average interest rate of overnight fed funds purchased 5.11 % 5.57 %\nPartner Solutions Activities\nThe Company's core differentiators, including industry experience, operational excellence, committed partnership, and mature risk and\ncompliance infrastructure are important for payment innovators in an evolving marketplace. Partner Solutions delivers a diversified portfolio of\nofferings including issuing, acquiring, digital payments, financial institution solutions, credit solutions, and professional tax solutions with an\noperating structure that streamlines banking processes and ensures reliable and sustainable programs with unparalleled commitment to\nenabling our partners' success. Overall, the products and services offered by the Company are generally designed to facilitate the processing\nand settlement of authorized electronic transactions involving the movement of funds.\n20\nTable of Contents\nWhile the Company has seasoned banking expertise and time-tested risk and compliance infrastructure, no guarantee can be made that the\nCompany will not experience losses in the Partner Solutions business line. The Company has signed agreements with terms extending through\nthe next few years with several of its largest sales agents/program managers, which the Company expects will help mitigate this risk.\nEach offering is discussed generally below with examples to illustrate use cases. The Company cross-utilizes personnel and resources across\nthese offerings.\nIssuing\nDDA Sponsorship. Partners looking to offer financial services in an ecosystem typically employ a direct deposit account, savings account or debit\ncard, or combination thereof. Pathward facilitates their ability to establish a seamless banking experience for both their consumer and business\ncustomers, complete with online acceptance and digital funds transfer, as well as options such as overdraft protection in times of income\nshortfalls and the overall benefit of improved money management.\nPrepaid Sponsorship. Similar to traditional debit cards, prepaid cards are embedded with a magnetic stripe, which encodes relevant card data\n(which may or may not include information about the user and/or purchaser of such card), and an EMV chip, which is equipped with a\nmicroprocessor chip and the technology used to authenticate chip card transactions. When the holder of a card attempts a permitted transaction,\nnecessary information, including the authorization for such transaction, is shared between the “point of use” or “point of sale” and authorization\nsystems maintaining the account of record. Most recently, “virtual” prepaid cards have become popular in the industry. Virtual prepaid cards are\nused in both the consumer space, for example as a gift card, and in the commercial arena to facilitate accounts payable and vendor payments.\nThe funds associated with such cards are typically held in pooled accounts at the Bank representing the aggregate value of all cards issued in\nconnection with particular products or programs. Although the funds are held in pooled accounts, the account of record indicates the funds held\nby each individual card. The cards may work in a closed loop (e.g., the card will only work at one particular merchant and will not work anywhere\nelse), a restricted access network (e.g., the card will only work at a specific set of merchants such as a shopping mall), or in an open loop by way\nof a Visa, MasterCard, or Discover branded debit card that will work wherever such cards are accepted for payment. Most of the Company's\nprepaid cards are open loop. Pathward is one of the leading prepaid card issuers in the United States.\nThe prepaid card business can generally be divided into two program categories: Consumer Use and Business or Commercial Use products.\nThese programs are typically offered through a third-party relationship.\nConsumer Use. Examples of consumer use prepaid card programs include payroll, general purpose reloadable (\"GPR\"), reward, gift and\nbenefit/HSA cards. Payroll cards are a product whereby an employee’s payroll is loaded to the card by their employer via direct deposit. GPR\ncards are usually distributed by retailers and can be reloaded an indefinite number of times at participating retail load networks. Other examples\nof reloadable cards are travel cards, which are used in place of traveler’s checks and can be reloaded a predetermined number of times, as well\nas tax-related cards where a taxpayer’s refund is placed on the card. Reloadable cards are generally open-loop cards that consumers can use to\nobtain cash at ATMs or purchase goods and services wherever such cards are accepted for payment.\nBusiness or Commercial Use. Prepaid cards are also frequently used by businesses for travel and entertainment, accounts payable and\nbusiness-to-business (\"B2B\") settlement products. For example, virtual prepaid cards are used to facilitate one-time payments between a\ncompany and its vendors for monthly settlement. Travel and entertainment cards, alternatively, are reloadable by the company for use by its\nemployees to travel for business.\nAcquiring\nMerchant Acquiring Sponsorship. Acquiring solutions include the acceptance, processing and settlement of credit card and debit card payments\nby an acquiring bank on behalf of merchants. Pathward acts as an acquiring bank to sponsor acquiring activity on behalf of merchant customers\nby leveraging partnerships with partners who act as merchant processors, third-party service providers, independent sales organizations\n(“ISOs”), and/or payment facilitators to identify, onboard and support merchant customers.\n21\nTable of Contents\nATM Sponsorship. The Company sponsors ATM ISOs into various networks and provides associated sponsorships of encryption support\norganizations and third-party processors in support of the financial institutions and the ATM ISO sponsorships. Sponsorship consists of the\nreview and oversight of entities participating in debit and credit networks.\nPathward currently provides financial processing services for approximately 300,000 freestanding ATMs nationwide providing consumers with\naccess to funds at ATMs frequently found in malls, retail chains, convenience stores, events, fairs and other small business locations across the\nU.S.\nDigital Payments\nMoney Movement Solutions. In today’s market, consumers want to move their money fast, with more visibility and control of their own financial\ntransactions. Pathward provides the financing operations for Automated Clearing House (\"ACH\") transactions, disburse to debit (through Visa\nDirect or Mastercard Send), wire or check processing which enable the faster, almost instantaneous movement of funds from sender to receiver.\nTechnology has accelerated the growth and speed of transactional payments for corporate and financial organizations. Prompt movement of\nmoney creates efficiency, speed and a robust marketplace for consumers, B2B and business-to-consumer (\"B2C\") companies.\nPathward is a Nacha Top 30 bank for receiving and originating payments. As of September 2024, Pathward typically processes a combined $2.5\nbillion per day in ACH and wire services to provide safe and efficient movement of money.\nFinancial Institution Solutions\nWith this suite of offerings, Pathward provides community banks and credit unions a path to fulfill the unique needs of their customers without\nusing in-house resources.\nPrepaid Solutions. Pathward has delivered myriad co-branded prepaid card programs that promote the brands of our financial institution clients.\nCommercial Financing Options. Today’s businesses require unique, flexible financial products to target areas ranging from acquiring new\nequipment and business expansion to maximizing cash flow and working capital. When business clients do not qualify for traditional financing or\nwhen a product is not available, Pathward provides a variety of options including asset-based lending and SBA lending.\nMerchant Services. Pathward’s merchant services program empowers community banks and credit unions to offer merchant processing services\nto their business clients, eliminating the challenges and liabilities associated with managing an independent program.\nProfessional Tax Solutions\nUnder the Refund Transfer program, the Bank opens a temporary bank account for each customer who is receiving an income tax refund and\nelects to defer payment of his or her tax preparation fees. After, the IRS and any state income tax authorities transfer the refund into the\ncustomer’s account, the net funds are transferred to the customer. The temporary deposit account remains available for use for two tax years,\nwhich allows for additional payments to be received in addition to federal and state refunds, and then the account is closed.\nRegulation and Supervision\nBoth the Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation in connection with their respective activities and operations, including those\nof their subsidiaries. On April 1, 2020, the Bank converted from a federal thrift charter to a national bank charter and the Company converted\nfrom a savings and loan holding company to a BHC that has elected to be a FHC.\nAs a national bank, the Bank is supervised and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), as its primary federal\nregulator, and the FDIC, the federal agency that administers the DIF. As a BHC, the Company is supervised and examined by the FRB. Federal\nbanking policy is designed to protect customers of and depositors in insured depository institutions, the DIF, and the U.S. banking system.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe framework by which both the Company and the Bank are supervised and examined is complex. This framework includes acts of Congress,\nregulations, policy statements and guidance, and other interpretive materials that define the obligations and requirements for entities\nparticipating in the U.S. banking system.\nMoreover, regulation of banks and their holding companies is subject to continual revision, both through statutory changes and corresponding\nregulatory revisions as well as through evolving supervisory objectives of banking agency examiners and supervisory staff. It is not possible to\npredict the content or timing of changes to the laws and regulations that may impact the business of the Bank and the Company. Any changes to\nthe regulatory framework applicable to the Company or the Bank, however, could have a material adverse impact on the condition or operations\nof each entity.\nIn addition to regulation and supervision by the FRB, the Company is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and is required to file reports with the SEC and otherwise comply with federal securities laws.\nAs described broadly below, the banking industry is subject to significant regulation. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list\nof all the activities regulated by the U.S. banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the Company or the Bank. Rather, it is\nintended to briefly summarize the legal and regulatory framework in which the Company and the Bank operate and describe legal requirements\nthat impact their businesses and operations. The information set forth below is subject to change and is qualified in its entirety by the actual laws\nand regulations referenced.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \"Dodd-Frank Act”)\nEnacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the financial regulatory regime in the United States. Since the enactment of the\nDodd-Frank Act, U.S. banks and financial services firms, such as the Company and the Bank, have been subject to enhanced regulation and\noversight. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to further\nrulemaking and interpretation by the federal banking agencies; moreover, certain provisions of the act that were implemented by federal\nagencies have been revised or rescinded pursuant to legislative changes adopted by the U.S. Congress.\nCertain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that directly impact the operation of the Company or the Bank are highlighted below:\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank is subject to regulations promulgated by the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “Bureau”). The Bureau has consolidated authority related to federal laws and regulations impacting\nthe provision of consumer financial products and services. The Bureau also has substantial power to define the rights of consumers and\nresponsibilities of lending institutions, such as the Bank. The Bureau does not, however, examine or supervise the Bank for compliance with\nsuch laws and regulations; rather, based on the Bank’s size (less than $10 billion in assets), enforcement authority remains with the OCC,\nalthough the Bank may be required to submit reports or other materials to the Bureau upon request. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides state\nattorneys general with the right to enforce federal consumer protection laws. The Bureau is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any\ncovered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any\ntransaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service (\"UDAAP\nauthority\"). To date, the Bureau has engaged in rulemaking and taken enforcement actions that directly impact the business operations of\nfinancial institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank and its divisions.\nInterchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that restrict interchange fees to those which are “reasonable and\nproportionate” for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing (known as the\n“Durbin Amendment”). In October 2023, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules that would reduce the maximum permissible interchange fee\ncap and would adopt an approach for future adjustments to the interchange fee cap. Although, as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, the interchange fee restrictions in the Durbin Amendment do not apply to the Bank because debit card issuers with total worldwide\nassets of less than $10 billion are exempt, such restrictions may negatively impact the pricing all debit card processors in the market, including\nthe Bank, may charge.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIncentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC,\nissue a rule related to incentive-based compensation. No final rule implementing this provision of the Dodd-Frank Act has, as of the date of the\nfiling of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, been adopted, but a proposed rule was published in May 2024. The proposed rule is intended to (i)\nprohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that the banking agencies determine could encourage certain financial institutions to take\ninappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss, (ii) require the board of directors of those\nfinancial institutions to take certain oversight actions related to incentive-based compensation, and (iii) require those financial institutions to\ndisclose information concerning incentive-based compensation arrangements to the appropriate federal regulator. Although a final rule has not\nbeen issued, the Company and the Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that their incentive compensation plans do not encourage\ninappropriate risks, consistent with the principles identified above.\nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (“Regulatory Relief Act”)\nEnacted in 2018, the Regulatory Relief Act includes several provisions that positively affect smaller banking institutions (e.g., those with less than\n$10 billion in assets) like the Bank. Specific provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act that benefit smaller banks include modifications to the\n“qualified mortgage” criteria under the “ability to repay” rules for certain mortgages that are held and maintained on the Bank’s retained portfolio\nas well as relief from certain capital requirements required by an international banking capital framework with the creation of a “community bank\nleverage ratio.” See “Regulatory Capital Requirements” and “Brokered Deposits.”\nTemporary Regulatory Capital Relief Related to Impact of CECL\nOn August 26, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the\nadoption of CECL. The interim final rule provided banking organizations that implemented CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for\ntwo years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology,\nfollowed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. The\nCompany elected to phase in the regulatory capital impact as permitted under this final rule. The CECL transition amount is being phased out of\nregulatory capital over a three-year period that began October 1, 2022 and ends on September 30, 2025.\nBank Regulation and Supervision\nThe Bank is a national bank that is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all of its operations by its primary federal\nregulator, the OCC, and by its deposit insurer, the FDIC. Such regulation covers all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices,\nsafeguarding deposits, capital structure, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel. The Bank pays assessment\nfees both to the OCC and the FDIC, and the level of such assessments reflects the condition of the Bank. If the condition of the Bank were to\ndeteriorate, the level of such assessments could increase significantly, having a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nRegulatory authorities have been granted extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities which are intended\nto strengthen the financial condition of the banking industry, including, but not limited to, the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an\ninstitution, the classification of assets by the institution, and the adequacy of an institution’s allowance for credit losses. Typically, these actions\nare undertaken due to violations of laws or regulations or conduct of operations in an unsafe or unsound manner.\nThe Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the National Bank Act (“NBA”) and the OCC’s implementing regulations promulgated\nthereunder. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate,\ncommercial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets. The Bank may also invest in operating subsidiaries,\nbank service companies (but not service corporations generally), financial subsidiaries, and may make non-controlling investments in other\nentities, in each case subject to the statutory provisions of the NBA and the OCC’s regulatory requirements and limitations.\nIn general, the Bank’s legal lending limit totals 15 percent of its capital and surplus plus an additional 10 percent of capital and surplus if the\namount that exceeds the 15 percent general limit is fully secured by readily marketable collateral (together, referred to as the “combined general\nlimit”). At September 30, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with the combined general limit.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe OCC announced on October 1, 2024 that its supervisory strategies for 2025 will focus on: (a) credit; (b) allowance for credit losses; (c) asset\nand liability management; (d) capital; (e) climate-related financial risks for banks with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets; (f)\ncybersecurity; (g) enterprise change management; (h) operations; (i) third-party risks; (j) payments; (k) Bank Secrecy Act/anti--money\nlaundering/countering the financing of terrorism and Office of Foreign Assets Control; (l) consumer compliance; (m) Community Reinvestment\nAct; and (n) fair lending.\nThe OCC’s 2025 supervisory plan provides the foundation for policy initiatives and for supervisory strategies as applied to national banks as well\nas their third-party service providers subject to OCC examination. OCC staff members use the supervisory plan to guide their supervisory\npriorities, planning, and resource allocations. The OCC typically provides periodic updates about supervisory priorities through the Semiannual\nRisk Perspective process in the fall and spring of each year.\nInsurance of Deposit Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC\nThe Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, a permanent increase in deposit\ninsurance to $250,000 was authorized. The coverage limit is per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership\ncategory. FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.\nWhile not the Bank's primary federal regulator, the FDIC, as insurer of the Bank's deposits, imposes deposit insurance premiums and is\nauthorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from\nengaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order poses a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has authority to initiate\nenforcement actions against any FDIC-insured institution after giving its primary federal regulator the opportunity to take such action, and may\nseek to terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or\nunsound condition. Finally, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound\npractices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition\nimposed by the FDIC or the OCC.\nThe FDIC imposes an assessment against all depository institutions for deposit insurance quarterly. FDIC total base assessment rates for\ninstitutions that have been insured for at least five years range from 2.5 to 42 basis points annually and take into account an institution’s\ncomposite CAMELS rating and other factors. Notably, the FDIC has the authority to increase an institution’s deposit insurance premium if it\ndetermines that an insured depository institution significantly relies upon brokered deposits. As of September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the\nBank’s deposit insurance assessment rate was 7 basis points, 7 basis points, and 5 basis points, respectively. The Bank’s deposit insurance\npremium expense totaled $5.3 million for 2024, $4.3 million for 2023, and $3.1 million for 2022. A significant increase in DIF insurance premiums\nwould have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank.\nThe designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) of the DIF reached 1.36% as of September 30, 2018, exceeding the statutorily required 1.35% two years\nahead of the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. On June 30, 2019, the DRR reached 1.40% and the FDIC applied small bank credits to\nbanks with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, beginning September 30, 2020. The FDIC will continue to apply small bank credits\nso long as the DRR is at least 1.35%. After applying small bank credits for four quarters, the FDIC will remit to banks the value of any remaining\nsmall bank credits in the next assessment period in which the DRR is at least 1.35%.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the FDIC to designate and publish the DRR before the beginning of each calendar year. For\ncalendar year 2024, the FDIC set the DRR at 2.00%, which is consistent with the DRR set for each calendar year since 2011 and the FDIC's\ngoal to maintain the DRR at or above the statutory threshold.\n25\nTable of Contents\nBrokered Deposits\nThe FDIC limits the ability to accept brokered deposits to those insured depository institutions that are well capitalized. Institutions that are less\nthan well capitalized cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless they have applied for and been granted a waiver by the\nFDIC. The FDIC has defined the “national rate” for all interest-bearing deposits held by less-than-well-capitalized institutions as “a simple\naverage of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available” and has stated that its presumption is that\nthis national rate is the prevailing rate in any market. As such, institutions that are less than well capitalized that are permitted to accept, renew\nor rollover brokered deposits via FDIC waiver generally may not pay an interest rate in excess of the national rate plus 75 basis points on such\nbrokered deposits. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank categorized $82.0 million, or 1% of its deposit liabilities, as brokered deposits.\nOn December 15, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule establishing a new framework for analyzing whether bank deposits obtained through third-\nparty arrangements are brokered deposits pursuant to Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Generally, a person is a \"deposit broker\"\nif it is \"engaged in the business of placing deposits, or facilitating the placement of deposits, of third parties with insured depository institutions or\nthe business of placing deposits with insured depository institutions for the purpose of selling interests in those deposits to third parties.\" The\nfinal rule clarifies what it means to be in the business of placing deposits and facilitating the placement of deposits for purpose of the deposit\nbroker definition.\nSection 29 provides, in particular, that a person with an exclusive deposit placement arrangement with one insured depository institution will not\nbe considered a deposit broker because it is not in the business of placing deposits or facilitating the placement of deposits.\nThe final rule also clarifies application of the “primary purpose exception” to Section 29 by identifying a number of common business\nrelationships described as “designated exceptions” as meeting the primary purpose exception. Many of these designated exceptions are\narrangements previously addressed in advisory opinions and include: certain investment-related deposits; property management service\ndeposits; deposits for cross-border clearing services; deposits related to real estate and mortgage servicing activities; retirement and 529\ndeposits; deposits related to employee benefits programs; deposits held to secure credit card loans; and deposits placed by agencies to\ndisburse government benefits. As a result of this final rule, the Company's deposits that were classified as brokered deposits reduced\nsignificantly beginning with the June 30, 2021 reporting period.\nOn July 30, 2024, the FDIC proposed a rule that would amend the current rules governing brokered deposits. The proposed rule as drafted\nwould, among other things, (1) amend the definition of “deposit broker”; (2) eliminate the exclusive deposit placement arrangement exception; (3)\neliminate the enabling transactions designated business exception; (4) revise the “25 percent test” designated business exception for a primary\npurpose exception to be available only to broker-dealers and investment advisers and only if less than 10 percent of the total assets that the\nbroker-dealer or investment adviser has under management for its customers is placed at one or more insured depository institutions; (5) revise\nthe interpretation of the primary purpose exception to consider the third party’s intent in placing customer funds at a particular insured depository\ninstitution; (6) allow only insured depository institutions to file notices and applications for primary purpose exceptions; and (7) clarify how an\ninsured depository institution that loses its “agent institution” status regains that status. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the\nproposed rule on the Company were it to be adopted as a final rule and monitoring the status of this rulemaking.\nBranching by National Banks\nSubject to certain limitations, federal statutes and OCC regulations permit national banks to establish branches in any state of the United States.\nWith OCC approval, a national bank may open an interstate de novo branch in any state that permits the establishment of a branch by a bank\nchartered by such state, subject to applicable state law limitations. The Bank's only banking office open to the public is its home office in Sioux\nFalls, South Dakota, where it accepts deposits.\n26\nTable of Contents\nPrepaid Accounts under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (\"Regulation E\") and the Truth In Lending Act (\"Regulation Z\")\nThe Bureau’s “Prepaid Accounts Rule,” adopted in October 2016, enhanced the regulations applicable to prepaid products and brought them\nfully within Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act. In addition, prepaid products that have a credit\ncomponent, like some of those offered in connection with an existing program manager agreement, are now regulated by Regulation Z, which\nimplements the federal Truth in Lending Act. The rule also extended Regulation Z’s credit card rules and disclosure requirements to prepaid\naccounts that provide overdraft services and other credit features. These rules became effective on April 1, 2019.\nShort-Term, Small-Dollar Installment Lending\nIn October 2017, the OCC rescinded its guidance on deposit advance products in light of the Bureau’s pending small dollar loan rule related to\npayday, vehicle title and certain high cost installment loans that was issued in November 2017 (“Small Dollar Rule”).\nThe Bureau issued its final Small Dollar Rule on July 22, 2020, which rescinded certain provisions of the rule that was issued in 2017 relating to\nmandatory underwriting. Specifically, the Bureau revoked provisions that: (i) provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make\na covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan, including payday and vehicle title loans, without reasonably determining that\nconsumers have the ability to repay those loans according to their terms; (ii) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the\nability-to-repay determination; (iii) exempt certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and (iv) establish related definitions,\nreporting, and recordkeeping requirements. The payment provisions of the Small Dollar Rule were not rescinded and restrict lenders from\nattempting to withdraw payment from a borrower’s account after two consecutive failed attempts unless the borrower provides new authorization\nfor the third attempt. In order to begin re-attempting payments, the lender must follow certain guidelines and obtain new authorizations where\napplicable. The Small Dollar Rule has been the subject of litigation, but the Bureau indicated that it expects the Small Dollar Rule to become\neffective on March 30, 2025.\nSeparately, in May 2018, the OCC published guidance that encourages national banks and federal savings associations to offer responsible\nshort-term, small-dollar installment loans with terms between two and twelve months and equal amortizing payments. Pursuant to the OCC’s\nguidance on this issue, banks are encouraged to offer these products in a manner that is consistent with sound risk management principles and\nclear, documented underwriting guidelines. Further, the federal banking agencies issued interagency guidance on May 20, 2020 to encourage\nbanks, savings associations, and credit unions to offer responsible small-dollar loans to customers for consumer and small business purposes.\nAs of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Bank has not determined to offer such products, although this position may\nchange as the Bank further refines its business plan in the future.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe OCC requires national banks, like the Bank, to have an effective and sound interest rate risk management program, including appropriate\nmeasurement and reporting, robust and meaningful stress testing, assumption development reflecting the institution’s experience, and\ncomprehensive model valuations. According to OCC guidance, interest rate risk exposure is supposed to be managed using processes and\nsystems commensurate with their earnings and capital levels; complexity; business model; risk profile; and scope of operations.\nStandards for Safety and Soundness\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines\nestablish certain safety and soundness standards for all depository institutions. The operational and managerial standards in the guidelines\ngenerally relate to the following: (1) internal controls and information systems; (2) internal audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit\nunderwriting; (5) interest rate exposure; (6) asset growth; (7) compensation, fees and benefits; (8) asset quality; and (9) earnings. Failure to\nmeet the standards in the guidelines could result in a request by the OCC to the Bank to provide a written compliance plan to demonstrate its\nefforts to come into compliance with such guidelines.\n27\nTable of Contents\nAnti-Money Laundering (“AML”) Laws and Regulations\nAML and financial transparency laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, impose strict\nstandards for gathering and verifying customer information in order to ensure funds or other assets are not being placed in U.S. financial\ninstitutions to facilitate terrorist financing and laundering of funds. Applicable laws require financial institutions to have AML programs in place\nand require the federal banking agencies to consider a holding company’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on certain\nmerger or acquisition applications. In addition, failure to comply with these requirements could lead to significant fines and penalties or the\nimposition of corrective orders. In July 2024, the federal banking agencies, including the FRB and OCC, proposed amendments to update the\nrequirements for supervised institutions to establish, implement and maintain effective, risk-based and reasonably designed AML and countering\nthe financing of terrorism (“CFT”) programs. The proposed amendments would require supervised institutions to identify, evaluate and document\nthe regulated institution’s money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit finance activity risks, as well as consider, as appropriate, the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (“FinCEN”) published national AML/CFT priorities.\nCustomer Identification Programs for Holders of Prepaid Cards\nThe federal banking agencies, including the OCC and the FRB, issued guidance in 2016 that extends the requirements of the Customer\nIdentification Program required by Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act to prepaid accounts where the cardholder has either the (i) ability to\nreload funds, or (ii) access to credit or overdraft features. If either of these features is present, the issuer must verify the identity of the named\naccount holder.\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity\nThe Bank is required by federal statutes and regulations to disclose its privacy policies to its customers. The Bank is also required to\nappropriately safeguard its customers’ personal information.\nOn November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to improve the sharing of information about cyber incidents. The final\nrule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator of any significant computer-security incident as soon as possible and\nno later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that a cyber incident has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that\nhave materially affected—or are reasonably likely to materially affect—the viability of a banking organization's operations, its ability to deliver\nbanking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. The final rule also requires a bank service provider to notify affected\nbanking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has\nmaterially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect banking organization customers for four or more hours. This rule became effective\nMay 1, 2022.\nIn addition, certain state laws could potentially impact the Bank’s operations, including those related to applicable notification requirements when\ncomputer-security incident or unauthorized access to customers’ nonpublic personal information has occurred.\nGuidance for Third-Party Relationships\nOn June 9, 2023, the OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC issued final interagency guidance on risk management of third-party relationships,\nincluding third-party lending relationships. The interagency guidance is based, in part, on the OCC’s previously existing third-party risk\nmanagement guidance from 2013 and seeks to, among other things, promote consistency in third-party risk management and provide sound risk\nmanagement guidance for third-party relationships commensurate with a bank’s risk profile and complexity as well as the criticality of the activity.\nThe final interagency guidance replaces each agency’s existing guidance on this topic (including the OCC's 2020 Frequently Asked Questions\non Third-Party Relationships) and is directed to all banking organizations supervised by the OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC. Additionally, third\nparty relationship risk management and banking as a service arrangements (including with respect to deposit products and services) have been\ntopics of focus for federal bank regulators in 2024 and further rulemaking activity or guidance may be forthcoming.\nUnclaimed Property Laws\nUnclaimed property (escheatment) laws vary by state but generally require holders of customer property (including money) to turn over such\nproperty to the applicable state after holding the property for the statutorily prescribed period of time. These laws are not uniform and impose\nvarying requirements on entities, like the Bank, which may hold funds that are required to be escheated to the applicable states.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAssessments\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides that, in establishing the amount of an assessment, the Comptroller of the Currency may consider the nature and\nscope of the activities of the entity, the amount and type of assets it holds, the financial and managerial condition of the entity and any other\nfactor that is appropriate. The assessments are paid to the OCC on a semi-annual basis. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the\nBank paid assessments (standard assessments) of $789,608 to the OCC.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe regulatory capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank (the “Capital Rules”) identify three components of regulatory capital: (i)\ncommon equity tier 1 capital (“CET1 Capital”), (ii) additional tier 1 capital, and (iii) tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 Capital and\nadditional tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain requirements. Total capital is the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital. CET1 Capital, tier 1\ncapital, and total capital serve as the numerators for three prescribed regulatory capital ratios. Risk-weighted assets, calculated using the\nstandardized approach in the Capital Rules for the Company and the Bank, provide the denominator for such ratios. There is also a leverage\nratio that compares tier 1 capital to average total assets.\nFailure by the Company or the Bank to meet minimum capital requirements set by the Capital Rules could result in certain mandatory and/or\ndiscretionary disciplinary actions by their regulators that could have a material adverse effect on their business and their consolidated financial\nposition. Under the capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (discussed below), the Company and the\nBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's and the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-\nbalance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are\nalso subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nThe Company and the Bank are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in\norder to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital\nconservation buffer is exclusively composed of CET1 Capital and applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios (but not the leverage\nratio).\nThe Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1 Capital. These include, for example, the requirement that\ndeferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant\ninvestments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 Capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of\nCET1 Capital or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1 Capital.\nThe Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings for a large and risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the\nnature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting\nin high-risk weights for a variety of asset classes. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements and\nwas designated as “well capitalized” under federal guidelines.\nThere have been several developments which are intended to reduce the regulatory capital burden on smaller or less complex banking\norganizations like the Company and the Bank. The effect that these developments will have on the Company and the Bank is currently uncertain.\nIn July 2019, the federal banking agencies finalized a rule intended to simplify and clarify a number of the more complex aspects of existing\nregulatory capital rules. Specifically, the rule simplifies the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets,\ninvestments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interest. The final rule also allows bank holding\ncompanies to redeem common stock without prior approval unless otherwise required. The final rule became effective April 1, 2020 for the\namendments to simplify capital rules, and October 1, 2019 for revisions to the pre-approval requirements for the redemption of common stock\nand other technical amendments. The Bank did not elect to implement the relief provided under the simplification rule.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOn November 21, 2018, the FDIC, the OCC, and the FRB jointly issued a proposed rule required by the Regulatory Relief Act that would permit\nqualifying banks that have less than $10 billion in consolidated assets to elect to be subject to a 9% leverage ratio that would be applied using\nless complex leverage calculations (referred to as the “community bank leverage ratio” or “CBLR”). Under the proposed rule, banks that opt into\nthe CBLR framework and maintain a CBLR of greater than 9% would not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements and\nwould be deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements. The rule was adopted in September 2019. The Bank continues to assess\nthe potential impact of opting in to this election as part of its ongoing capital management and planning processes.\nPrompt Corrective Action (\"PCA\")\nFederal banking agencies are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their\nminimum capital requirements expressed in terms of a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a CET1 ratio, and a leverage\nratio (as identified in the tables above).\nWell capitalized banks may not make a capital distribution or pay management fees if the bank would be undercapitalized after making such\ndistributions or paying such fees. Adequately capitalized banks, in general, cannot pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would\nleave them undercapitalized; they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if, after paying the fee, they would be undercapitalized;\nand they cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless they have applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC.\nThe activities of an “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” bank are further restricted. Any such bank\nmust submit a capital restoration plan that is guaranteed by each company that controls the Bank, and such company must provide appropriate\nassurances of performance. Until such plan is approved, the bank may not increase its assets, acquire another institution, establish a branch or\nengage in any new activities, and generally may not make capital distributions. The federal banking agencies are authorized to impose additional\nrestrictions, discussed below, that are applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.\nThe imposition of any action taken by the OCC against the Bank in connection with the agency’s PCA authority would likely have a substantial\nadverse effect on it and on the Company’s operations and profitability. This is especially true if the Bank were to no longer be deemed to be well\ncapitalized and, therefore, subject to limitations on its ability to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC. The\nCompany's stockholders are not entitled to preemptive rights and, therefore, if the Company is directed by its regulators to issue additional\nshares of common stock, such issuance may result in dilution to the Company's existing stockholders.\nInstitutions in Troubled Condition\nCertain events, including entering into a formal written agreement with a bank’s regulator that requires action to improve the bank’s financial\ncondition, or being informed by the regulator that the bank is in troubled condition, will automatically result in limitations on so-called “golden\nparachute” agreements pursuant to Section 18(K) of the FDIA. In addition, organizations that are not in compliance with minimum capital\nrequirements, or are otherwise in a troubled condition, must give 90 days’ written notice to the OCC before appointing a Director or Senior\nExecutive Officer, pursuant to the OCC’s regulations.\nCivil Money Penalties\nThe OCC has the authority to assess civil money penalties (“CMPs”) against any national bank, federal savings bank or any of their institution-\naffiliated parties (“IAPs”). In addition, the OCC has the authority to assess CMPs against bank service companies and service providers. CMPs\nmay encourage an affected party to correct violations, unsafe or unsound practices or breaches of fiduciary duty. CMPs are also intended to\nserve as a deterrent to future violations of law, regulations, orders and other conditions.\nLimitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions\nThe NBA and related federal regulations govern the permissibility of dividends and capital distributions by a national bank. As a national bank,\nthe Bank’s board of directors may not declare, and the Bank may not pay, any dividend in an amount greater than the sum of current period net\nincome and retained earnings. A distribution in excess of that amount is a reduction in permanent capital, and the Bank would need to follow the\napplicable procedures set forth in OCC regulations and guidance. Further, the Bank’s board of directors may not declare a dividend if paying the\ndividend would result in the Bank being undercapitalized under the OCC’s PCA rule.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe Bank also must obtain prior approval from the OCC to pay a cash dividend if the dividend would exceed the sum of current period net\nincome and retained earnings from the past two years, after deducting the following transactions during that period: (i) any dividends previously\ndeclared, (ii) extraordinary transfers required by the OCC, and (iii) payments made for the retirement of preferred stock. This calculation is\nperformed on a rolling basis as described in the OCC’s earnings limitation regulations.\nThe Bank paid cash dividends in the amount of $87.0 million to the Company during fiscal 2024, to be used to fund share repurchases under the\ncommon stock share repurchase programs that were authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. On September 3, 2021, the Company's\nBoard of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to 6,000,000 shares of the\nCompany's outstanding common stock on or before September 30, 2024. On August 25, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a\nnew stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to an additional 7,000,000 shares of the Company's\noutstanding common stock on or before September 30, 2028. As part of its capital planning, the Company will continue to regularly assess its\nneeds for dividends from the Bank in order to fund future share repurchases and dividends to the Company's stockholders as needed.\nTransactions with Affiliates\nThe Bank must comply with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act relative to transactions with “affiliates,” generally defined to mean\nany company that controls or is under common control with the institution (as such, the Company is an affiliate of the Bank for these purposes).\nTransactions between an institution or its subsidiaries and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the Bank as terms prevailing at\nthe time for transactions with non-affiliates. Certain transactions, such as loans to an affiliate, are restricted to a percentage of the institutions’\ncapital (e.g., the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the\ninstitution; the aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the institution’s capital and surplus).\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (“CRA”)\nUnder the CRA, the Bank is evaluated periodically by its primary federal banking regulator to determine if it is meeting its continuing and\naffirmative obligations consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its assessment areas, including low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods. CRA ratings can also impact an insured depository institution’s ability to engage in certain activities as CRA\nperformance is considered in connection with certain applications by depository institutions and their holding companies, including merger\napplications, charter applications, and applications to acquire assets or assume liabilities. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” rating during its\nmost recent Performance Evaluation dated January 29, 2024.\nOn October 24, 2023, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule to modernize CRA regulations consistent with the following key\ngoals: (i) to encourage banks to expand access to credit, investment, and banking services in low to moderate income communities; (ii) to adapt\nto changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking and the growth of non-branch delivery systems; (iii) to provide greater\nclarity and consistency in the application of the CRA regulations, including adoption of a new metrics-based approach to evaluating bank retail\nlending and community development financing; and (iv) to tailor CRA evaluations and data collection to bank size and type, recognizing that\ndifferences in bank size and business models may impact CRA evaluations and qualifying activities. Most of the final CRA rule’s requirements\nwill be applicable beginning January 1, 2026, with certain requirements, including the data reporting requirements, applicable as of January 1,\n2027. The Bank is evaluating the expected impact of the modified CRA regulations.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\nThe Bank is a member of the FHLB system through the FHLB of Des Moines, one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing\ncredit function that is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to\nbe fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances must be used for residential home\nfinancing.\nAs a member of the FHLB system, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain activity-based capital stock in the FHLB in the amount\nspecified by the applicable FHLB's capital plan. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had in the aggregate $16.3 million in FHLB stock, which was in\ncompliance with the FHLB of Des Moines' requirement. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, dividends paid by the FHLB to the Bank\ntotaled $0.7 million.\n31\nTable of Contents\nOther Regulation\nThe Bank is also subject to a variety of other regulations with respect to its business operations including, but not limited to, the Truth in Lending\nAct, the Truth in Savings Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Military\nLending Act, the Servicemembers’ Civil Relief Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Telephone Consumer\nProtection Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\nIt is possible that additional rulemaking could require significant revisions to the regulations under which the Bank operates and is supervised.\nAny change in such laws and regulations or interpretations thereof negatively impacting the Bank's or the Company's current operations,\nwhether by the OCC, the FDIC, the Bureau, the FRB or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its operations\nand on the Company and its stockholders.\nHolding Company Regulation and Supervision\nThe Company is subject to examination, supervision, and certain reporting requirements by the Federal Reserve, which has responsibility for the\nprimary regulation and supervision of all BHCs, including the Company, under the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHCA”). The Federal Reserve\nalso has supervisory authority over any nonbank subsidiary of a BHC that is not functionally regulated by another federal or state regulator, such\nas a leasing subsidiary. Through the supervisory process, the Federal Reserve ensures that BHCs, like the Company, comply with law and\nregulation and are operated in a manner that is consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The Federal Reserve supervises BHCs\npursuant to Regulation Y (12 C.F.R. Part 225) and a supervisory program that seeks to ensure that BHCs comply with rules and regulations and\nthat they operate in a safe and sound manner.\nAs a BHC that has elected to become a FHC, the Company may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged\nin any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve in consultation\nwith the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and\nsoundness of depository institutions or the financial system (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve). Activities that are financial in nature\ninclude securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, and making merchant banking investments.\nAcquisitions\nFederal law prohibits a BHC, including the Company, directly or indirectly, from: (a) acquiring control (as defined under Regulation Y) of another\nbank (or a holding company parent) without prior Federal Reserve approval; or (b) through merger, consolidation or purchase of assets,\nacquiring another bank or a holding company thereof, or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution (or a holding company),\nwithout prior Federal Reserve approval. In evaluating applications by BHCs to acquire other holding companies and banks, the Federal Reserve\nmust consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition\non the risk to the DIF, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.\nOn September 17, 2024, the OCC issued a final rule related to its regulations for business combinations involving national banks and a policy\nstatement that summarizes the principles the OCC uses when it reviews proposed bank merger transactions under the Bank Merger Act\n(“BMA”). The final rule removes provisions related to expedited review and the use of the streamlined business combination application. The\npolicy statement discusses the OCC’s review of applications submitted under the BMA, including general principles for the OCC’s review and the\nOCC’s consideration of the financial stability, managerial and financial resources and future prospects and the convenience and statutory needs\nfactors under the BMA. On September 17, 2024, the FDIC also approved a final Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions addressing\nthe scope of transactions subject to FDIC approval, the FDIC’s process for evaluating merger applications, and the principles that guide the\nFDIC’s consideration of the applicable statutory factors as set forth in the BMA.\n32\nTable of Contents\nChange in Bank Control\nFederal law and regulation set forth the types of transactions that require prior notice under the Change in Bank Control Act (“CIBCA”). Pursuant\nto CIBCA and Regulation Y, any person (acting directly or indirectly) that seeks to acquire control of a bank or its holding company must provide\nprior notice to the Federal Reserve. A “person” includes an individual, bank, corporation, partnership, trust, association, joint venture, pool,\nsyndicate, sole proprietorship, unincorporated organization, or any other form of entity. A person acquires \"control\" of a banking organization\nwhenever the person acquires ownership, control, or the power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the institution. The\napplicable regulations also provide for certain other \"rebuttable\" presumptions of control.\nIn April 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to revise its regulations related to determinations of whether a company has the ability to\nexercise a controlling influence over another company for purposes of the BHCA. The final rule expands and codifies the presumptions for use in\nsuch determinations. By codifying the presumptions, the final rule provides greater transparency on the types of relationships that the Federal\nReserve generally views as supporting a facts-and-circumstances determination that one company controls another company. The Federal\nReserve’s final rule applies to questions of control under the BHCA, but does not extend to CIBCA.\nSource of Strength and Capital Requirements\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires all companies, including BHCs, that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution to serve as a\nsource of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to maintain adequate resources to support such\ninstitutions; to date, however, specific regulations implementing this requirement have not been published. As an BHC, the Company is also\nsubject to the same regulatory capital requirements as the Bank.\nExamination\nIn 2019, the Federal Reserve published finalized guidance with respect to inspection frequency and scope for BHCs with less than $10 billion in\nassets. According to the Federal Reserve, with respect to institutions with less than $10 billion in assets (such as the Company), the\ndetermination of whether a holding company is \"complex\" versus \"noncomplex\" is made at least annually on a case-by-case basis taking into\naccount and weighing a number of considerations, such as: the size and structure of the holding company; the extent of intercompany\ntransactions between insured depository institution subsidiaries and the holding company or uninsured subsidiaries of the holding company; the\nnature and scale of any non-bank activities; and the degree of leverage of the holding company, including the extent of its debt outstanding to\nthe public.\nDividends\nIn 2009, the Federal Reserve released a supervisory letter entitled Applying Supervisory Guidance and Regulations on the Payment of\nDividends, Stock Redemptions and Stock Repurchases at Bank Holding Companies. This letter generally sets forth principles describing when a\nBHC must consult, provide notice, or seek approval from the FRB prior to a capital distribution including the payment of dividends, stock\nredemptions, or stock repurchases. According to FRB staff, the FRBs are likely to require holding companies to eliminate, defer or reduce\ndividends if these payments are not fully covered by the net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, earnings retention is not\nconsistent with capital needs or the holding company will not meet or is in danger of not meeting minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nManagement\nIn August 2017, the Federal Reserve published proposed guidance related to supervisory expectations for boards of directors of BHCs. The\nproposal sought to clarify supervisory expectations of boards and distinguish the roles held by senior management to allow boards to focus on\nfulfilling their core responsibilities. On February 26, 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a Supervision and Regulation letter (SR 21-3/CA 21-1)\ncontaining its final supervisory guidance on the effectiveness of a banking institution's board of directors. Although the guidance only applies to\nbank holding companies and savings-and-loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, the Company continues\nto monitor the Federal Reserve's evolving supervisory and regulatory approach to board and senior management effectiveness.\nAdditional Regulatory Matters\nThe Company is subject to oversight by the SEC, NASDAQ and various state securities regulators. In the normal course of business, the\nCompany has received requests for information from these regulators. Such requests have been considered routine and incidental to the\nCompany’s operations.\n33\nTable of Contents\nFederal and State Taxation\nPathward Financial and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and various consolidated state income tax returns.\nAdditionally, Pathward Financial or its subsidiaries file separate company income tax returns in states where required. All returns are filed on a\nfiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The Company monitors relevant tax authorities and changes its estimate of accrued\nincome tax due to changes in income or franchise tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities.\nCompetition\nThe Company operates in competitive markets for each of the different financial sectors in which it engages in business: payments, commercial\nfinance, tax services and consumer lending. Competitors include a wide range of regional and national banks and financial services companies\nlocated both in the Company's market areas and across the nation.\nThe Company’s Partner Solutions business line serves customers nationally and also faces strong competition from large commercial banks and\nspecialty providers of electronic payments processing and servicing, including prepaid, debit and credit card issuers, ACH processors and ATM\nnetwork sponsors. Many of these national players are aggressive competitors, leveraging relationships and economies of scale.\nAs part of its national lending operations, the Company also faces strong competition from non-bank commercial finance companies, leasing\ncompanies, factoring companies, consumer finance and others on a nationwide basis. In addition, the Company’s tax return processing services\ndivision competes nationwide with financial institutions that offer similar processing technologies and capabilities.\nHuman Capital Resources\nThe Company's purpose of powering financial inclusion is foundational to our ability to attract and retain top talent who desire to work with\ninnovators to enable financial availability, choice, and opportunity for consumers and businesses in underserved markets. We empower our\nemployees by providing opportunities to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and well-\nbeing programs. We seek to provide a diverse, inclusive, safe, and healthy workplace, recognizing our employees enable us to deliver on our\npurpose.\nDemographics\nThe following table describes the composition of our workforce as of September 30, 2024:\nEmployee Type 9/30/2023 9/30/2024 Change\nFull-time 1,192 1,239 3.94%\nAll Other Types 7 5 (28.57)%\nTotal Employees 1,199 1,244 3.75%\nWomen 53%\nRacial/Ethnic Minorities 22%\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (\"DEIB\")\nAt Pathward, we are committed to advancing DEIB to meet the dynamic needs of our workforce and business. We aim to cultivate an\nenvironment where every employee is embraced and recognized for their unique contributions in serving our clients, partners and communities.\nPathward works to promote diversity throughout our organization and provide an equal opportunity for employment and success regardless of\nbackground and identity, as reflected in our Code of Business Conduct and Employee Handbook.\n34\nTable of Contents\nTalent Acquisition\nA core tenet of our talent system is to both develop talent from within and enrich our talent pool with external hires to support a continuous\nimprovement mindset. Our “Talent Anywhere” recruitment strategy enables us to source candidates needed to fill essential capabilities and roles\nwhile positioning us as a remote-enabled employer of choice. Our remote-enabled workplace has created valuable benefits for both employees\nand our business by reducing necessary commutes, allowing us to hire diverse talent from anywhere in the United States, and realizing a\nreduction in our physical footprint. As part of our DEIB strategy, we train our internal recruiters on how to mitigate unconscious bias in the hiring\nprocess and how to assemble diverse candidate slates for open positions.\nTalent Assessment and Development\nAssessing talent and leadership development are also critical to our talent growth and retention strategy. We continue to mature and expand our\ntalent management framework. This framework is used throughout the company to better equip Pathward to have clear line of sight into teams’\nstrengths and opportunities in terms of skills, diversity, and leadership potential. This helps ensure our internal talent supply keeps pace with\ndemand, that we invest in our workforce with intention, have our highest performing, highest potential employees applied to our most critical\nwork, and are preparing today’s talent for tomorrow’s needs.\nOur performance management program is an interactive practice that engages our employees beginning with aligning objectives at the\nenterprise level to drive individual goal setting and quarterly conversations designed to review progress and accomplishments and calibrate on\nfocus areas for the upcoming quarter, driving progress against objectives, alignment, and performance feedback throughout the year. We offer a\nvariety of support to help team members and managers establish and meet personalized development goals, take on new roles and become\nbetter leaders.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe recognize that team members who are involved in, enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace contribute meaningfully to\nthe success of the company. As a normal course of business, we complete enterprise-wide engagement surveys. The results of the survey are\nreviewed with the executive management team and are used to prioritize employee programs, initiatives, and communications.\nTotal Rewards\nAs part of our total rewards strategy, we aspire to offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees that attract\nand retain superior talent. In addition to competitive base wages, we offer other variable pay depending on an employee's position, including an\nannual bonus or commission plan. We offer a 401(k) plan with a highly competitive company match. Our healthcare, insurance benefits, health\nsavings and flexible spending accounts are equally competitive with a low-cost share for the employee. We also provide employer paid short-\nand long-term disability and life insurance benefits. We understand how important it is that our employees have time away from work. To allow\nemployees time to recharge, we offer paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption assistance, employee\nassistance programs, and other related benefits. We want our employees to be healthy and be able to bring their whole selves to the workplace.\nHealth and Safety\nWe believe the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health,\nsafety, and wellness of our employees. Being a fully remote-enabled employer, we provide laptops and related hardware along with a stipend to\nenhance employees' at-home work experience. Employees also have access to our offices if they choose to work there instead. Our employees\nand their families are also supported with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that\nsupport their physical and mental health. We follow local, state and federal regulations issued by the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration and are prepared to implement any applicable workplace requirements.\n35\nTable of Contents\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s website address is www.pathwardfinancial.com.

material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n• The price of our common stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors.\n• An investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\n• Future sales or additional issuances of our capital stock may depress prices of shares of our common stock or otherwise dilute the book\nvalue of shares then outstanding.\n• Changes in accounting policies or accounting standards, or changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could\nmaterially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\n• If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be\nimpaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\n• Federal regulations and our organizational documents may inhibit a takeover, prevent a transaction you favor or limit our growth\nopportunities, causing the market price of our common stock to decline.\n• We may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\n• Catastrophic events could negatively impact our operations, the operations of third parties with which we do business, and the\ncommunities in which we do business.\n• Legal challenges to and regulatory investigations of our, or the Bank's, operations could have a significant material adverse effect on us.\n• Our reputation and business could be damaged by negative publicity.\n• Existing insurance policies may not adequately protect us and our subsidiaries.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business\nOur framework for managing risk, including our underwriting practices, may not prevent future losses.\nWe have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which we are\nsubject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among\nothers. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies, as there may exist,\nor develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. For example, if our underwriting practices or criteria fail to\nadequately identify, price, and mitigate credit risks, such as risks related to economic disruption and the risk in our refund advance loan portfolio\nthat the IRS or the relevant state revenue department does not pay our customer's tax refund in full or the risk that any of our EROs will facilitate\nor engage in malfeasance or offer the Bank's products\n38\nTable of Contents\nand services in a manner that does not comply with applicable law or contractual representations, warranties and covenants, it is possible that\nlosses in our loan portfolio will exceed the amounts the Bank has set aside for loss reserves and result in reduced interest income and increased\nprovision for credit loss, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any resulting deterioration in our\nloan and lease portfolio could also cause a decrease in our capital, which would make it more difficult to maintain regulatory capital compliance.\nFurther, risk mitigation techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome\nor the specific circumstances and timing of such outcomes, which may result in the Bank or any of its business lines incurring unexpected\nlosses.\nWe are subject to credit risk in connection with our lending and leasing activities, and our financial condition and results of operations may be\nnegatively impacted by factors that adversely affect our borrowers.\nWe, through the Bank and its business lines, originate various types of loans and leases, and our financial condition and results of operations\nare affected by the ability of borrowers to repay their loans or leases in a timely manner. Borrowers may be unable to repay their loans due to\nvarious factors, some of which are outside of their control. Similarly, borrowers under our commercial loans and related financing products\n(typically, small- to medium-sized businesses) may be more susceptible to even mild or moderate economic declines than larger commercial\nborrowers, which may subject the Bank and, ultimately, us, to a higher risk of loan loss. Many borrowers have been negatively impacted by\nrecent events impacting financial, real estate, and securities markets, including geopolitical turmoil, higher interest rates, inflation, adverse\ndevelopments in the financial services industry, and other events that have caused market and economic volatility, and may continue to be\nsimilarly or more severely affected in the future. The risk of non-payment by borrowers is assessed through our underwriting processes and\nother risk management practices, which may not be able to fully identify, price and mitigate such risk. See \"Our framework for managing risk,\nincluding our underwriting practices, may not prevent future losses.\" Despite those efforts, we do and will experience loan and lease losses, and\nour financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected by those loan and lease losses.\nIf our actual credit losses exceed our allowance for credit losses, our net income will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and subjective judgments about the collectability of our loan and lease portfolio, including the creditworthiness of\nour borrowers and the value of the assets serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans and leases, which are subject to change. Despite\nour underwriting and monitoring practices, our loan and lease customers may not repay their loans and leases according to their terms, and the\ncollateral securing the payment of these loans and leases may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan and lease balance. We may experience\nsignificant credit losses due to nonpayment by our borrowers, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition and\nresults of operation, as well as the value of our common stock. Because we must use assumptions to establish our allowance for credit losses,\nthe current allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, and increases in the allowance, which may be\nsignificant, may be necessary. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to\nincrease our provision for credit loss or recognize loan charge-offs. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net\nincome. We cannot provide any assurance that our monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that our allowance for\ncredit losses will be adequate to cover actual losses.\nOur earnings are significantly affected by general business, political and economic conditions.\nOur operations and profitability, including the value of the portfolio of investment securities we hold and the value of collateral securing certain of\nour loans, are impacted by general business, political and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include short-\nterm and long-term interest rates, inflation, commodity pricing, money supply and monetary policy, political issues, legislative and regulatory\nchanges, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance, the strength of the United States economy,\nand uncertainty in financial markets globally, all of which are beyond our control. A deterioration in business, political or economic conditions,\nincluding those arising from pandemics, geopolitical turmoil and war, government shutdowns or defaults, or increases in unemployment, could\nresult in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets, decreases in loan collateral values, and a decrease in demand for our\nproducts and services, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nAdditionally, an unpredictable or volatile political environment in the United States, including any social unrest and uncertainty as a result of the\n2024 U.S. presidential election, could negatively impact business and market\n39\nTable of Contents\nconditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which could\nhave a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. It is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes\nthat may result due to the upcoming presidential election. A new administration, or a change in the make-up of either the Senate and/or House of\nRepresentatives may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and style. New appointments to the Board of\nGovernances of the Federal Reserve could affect monetary policy and interest rates, which could in turn affect economic growth.\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts\nof economic conditions, and determinations as to whether economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and\nleases. The level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may, in turn, impact\nthe reliability of our underwriting processes. See also \"If our actual loan and lease losses exceed our allowance for credit losses, our net income\nwill decrease.\"\nThe electronic payments industry, including the prepaid financial services segment within that industry in which the Partner Solutions business\nline operates, depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer spending, which may decrease if economic or political conditions in the United\nStates deteriorate and result in a reduction of the number of our prepaid accounts that are purchased or reloaded, the number of transactions\ninvolving our cards and the use of our reloadable card products and related services. A sustained reduction in the use of our products and\nrelated services, either as a result of a general reduction in consumer spending or as a result of a disproportionate reduction in the use of card-\nbased payment systems, would materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse developments or concerns affecting the financial services industry or specific financial institutions could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nActual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional\ncounterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any\nevents of these kinds or other similar events, have in the past and may in the future lead to erosion of customer confidence in the banking\nsystem, deposit volatility, liquidity issues, stock price volatility, increased regulatory scrutiny and other adverse developments. For example, the\nclosures of Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\") and Signature Bank in March 2023, and First Republic Bank in May 2023, led to disruption and volatility,\nincluding deposit outflows and increased need for liquidity, at certain banks. Although depositors of these banks were largely protected, it is not\ncertain that the Federal Reserve or FDIC will treat future bank failures similarly.\nSimilarly, inflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities with\ninterest rates below current market interest rates. Any sale of investment securities that are held in an unrealized loss position by financial\ninstitutions for liquidity or other purposes will cause actual losses to be realized. There can be no assurance that there will not be additional bank\nfailures or issues such as liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry or in the U.S. financial system as a whole. Adverse financial\nmarket and economic conditions can exert downward pressure on stock prices, security prices, and credit availability for financial institutions\nwithout regard to their underlying financial strength. The volatility and economic disruption resulting from the failures of SVB and Signature Bank\nparticularly impacted the price of securities issued by financial institutions, including us.\nWhile we did not experience any abnormal changes in our total outstanding deposit balances following the bank closures in March and May\n2023 and related events, we experienced changes in deposit balances resulting from typical seasonal fluctuations due to the nature of our\nbusiness. While our deposit base primarily consists of millions of retail cards and other small dollar accounts with an average balance less than\n$1,000 and we maintain a liquidity position with numerous funding options available totaling over $2.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, we\ncannot be assured that unusual deposit withdrawal activity will not affect banks generally in the future or us in particular. Continued uncertainty\nregarding or worsening of the severity or duration of the volatility in the banking industry could also adversely impact our estimate of our\nallowance for credit losses and related provision for credit loss.\nAny of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the events described above, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and\nour current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results of operations.\n40\nTable of Contents\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of funds\nare deposits, derived principally through our Partner Solutions business line, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans and leases\nand mortgage-backed securities, and maturing investment securities. We also utilize wholesale deposit sources to provide temporary funding\nwhen necessary or when favorable terms are available. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other\nsources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or\non terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy\ngenerally. Any decline in available funding in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable could adversely\nimpact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses or fulfill our obligations, such as repaying our borrowings or meeting\ndeposit withdrawal demands, any of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Liquidity and Capital\nResources” of this Form 10-K.\nOur investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate anticipated returns, causing an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe invest in certain tax-advantaged investments that support renewable energy resources. Our investments in these projects are designed to\ngenerate a return in part through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. We\nare subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features\nrequired to be met at the project level, may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized.\nThe risk of not being able to realize, or of subsequently incurring a recapture of, the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on various\nfactors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in the applicable tax code, as well as the continued economic viability of the\nproject and project operator. Further, while we engage in due diligence review both prior to the initial investment and on an ongoing basis, our\ndue diligence review may not identify relevant issues or risks that may adversely impact our ability to realize these tax credits or other tax\nbenefits. The possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits would have a negative impact on our financial results.\nThe residual value of leased equipment at the time of its disposition may be less than forecasted at the time we entered into the lease.\nThrough our Commercial Finance business line, we engage in equipment leasing activities. The market value of any given piece of leased\nequipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold due to various factors, including factors beyond our control. The market\nvalue of used leased equipment depends on several factors, including:\n• the market price for new equipment that is similar;\n• the age and condition of the leased equipment at the time it is sold;\n• the supply of and demand for similar used equipment on the market;\n• technological advances relating to the leased equipment or similar equipment; and\n• economic conditions in the specific business or industry in which the equipment is used, as well as broader regional or national economic\nconditions.\nWe include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of leased equipment sold.\nChanges in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of\nleased equipment. If we sell our used leased equipment at prices significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipated at\nthe time we entered into the lease, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.\n41\nTable of Contents\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings depend substantially on our interest rate spread, which is the difference between (i) the interest rates we earn on loans, securities,\nand other interest-earning assets, and (ii) the interest rates we pay on deposits, other borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. We are\nexposed to interest rate risk because our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not react uniformly or concurrently to changes\nin interest rates since the two have different time periods for adjustment and can be tied to different measures of rates. These rates are highly\nsensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory\nauthorities, including the Federal Reserve. Throughout 2022, 2023 and 2024, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds\nrate in an effort to curb inflation. In September 2024 and November 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds\nrate to its current range of 4.50% to 4.75% in light of the progress on inflation. As market interest rates have risen, we have experienced\ncompetitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits, which may decrease our net interest income. In addition, inflationary pressures\nwill generally increase our operating costs and could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers and the values of collateral securing\nloans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. In addition, certain of our noninterest income and noninterest expenses are\nsubject to adverse effect in a rising interest rate environment. The Bank monitors its interest rate risk exposure; however, the Bank can provide\nno assurance that its efforts will appropriately protect the Bank in the future from interest rate risk exposure. For additional information, see Part\nII, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nWe operate in an extremely competitive market, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nWe encounter significant competition in all of our market areas and national business lines from other commercial banks, savings and loan\nassociations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, factoring companies, card issuers, securities brokerage\nfirms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial intermediaries, including but not limited to fintech or neobank\nfinancial intermediaries. Some of our and the Bank's competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits, may be subject to less\nregulation than we are, may offer services that we do not or cannot provide and, due to their size and other factors, may be able to offer services\nat more competitive rates. Our profitability depends upon both our ability to compete successfully in our market areas and the Bank's and the\ndivisions' ability to compete in their various business markets.\nFor example, the Commercial Finance business line competes for loans, leases, and other financial services with numerous national and\nregional banks, thrifts, credit unions, and other financial institutions, as well as other entities that provide financial services, including specialty\nlenders, securities firms, and mutual funds. Certain larger commercial financing companies do not currently focus their marketing efforts on\nsmaller commercial companies; however, any shift in focus by such larger financing companies may further fragment existing market share in\nthis commercial finance industry. Moreover, some of the financial institutions and financial service organizations with which the Commercial\nFinance business line competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as the Commercial Finance business line and the Bank. Many\nof the Commercial Finance business line's competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger and\nmay offer other services that neither the Commercial Finance business line nor the Bank do.\nSeveral banking institutions have adopted business strategies similar to ours, particularly with respect to the banking-as-a-service (\"BaaS\")\nbusiness. This competition, and competition in any of the Bank's other business lines, may increase our costs, reduce our revenues or revenue\ngrowth, result in fragmented market share and a failure to enjoy economies of scale or make it difficult for us to compete effectively in\nmaintaining and obtaining additional customer relationships.\nOur business could suffer if consumer behaviors, or other factors, in connection with the use of prepaid cards change, or there are adverse\ndevelopments with respect to the prepaid financial services industry in general.\nAs the prepaid financial services industry evolves, consumers may either find prepaid financial services to be less attractive than other financial\nservices or may change the way in which they utilize the service prepaid cards provide. Consumers might not use prepaid financial services for\nany number of reasons. For example, negative publicity surrounding us or other prepaid financial service providers could impact the Payments\nbusiness and prospects for growth to the extent it adversely impacts the perception of prepaid financial services. Consumer spend behaviors\ncould increase or decrease, or become more difficult to accurately predict, thereby impacting operating revenues and/or expenses of the\nCompany. Growth of prepaid financial services as an electronic payment mechanism may not\n42\nTable of Contents\noccur or may occur more slowly than estimated. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur operations depend upon third-party relationships; our ability to maintain such relationships and such third parties' performances could adversely\naffect our business.\nThe Bank has entered into numerous arrangements with third parties with respect to the operations of its business, as described in Part I, Item 1\n\"Business.\" Upon the expiration of the then-current term, any such agreements may not be renewed by the third party or may be renewed on\nterms less favorable to the Bank. In some cases, such agreements may permit the third party to unilaterally prescribe certain business practices\nand procedures with respect to the Bank and its business lines (as is the case under agreements with Discover, MasterCard, Visa and other card\nnetworks) or terminate the agreement early under certain circumstances (as is the case under our program management agreement with\nEmerald Financial Services, LLC (\"EFS\") with respect to certain H&R Block financial services if the Bank should lose its exemption from the\nDurbin Amendment). To the extent any agreement with a service provider is terminated, we may not be able to secure alternate service\nproviders, and, even if we do, the terms with alternate providers may not be as favorable as those currently in place. In addition, were we to lose\nany of our significant third-party providers, including in our refund advance related business in which we have a limited number of partners, it\ncould cause a material disruption in our ability to service our customers, which also could have an adverse material impact on the Bank, its\nbusiness lines and, ultimately, us. Moreover, significant disruptions in our ability to provide services could negatively affect the perception of our\nbusiness, which could result in a loss of confidence and other adverse effects on our business.\nIn addition, if any of our counterparties is unable to or otherwise does not fulfill (or does not timely fulfill) its obligations to us for any reason\n(including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, computer or other technological interruptions or failures, personnel loss, negative regulatory actions, or\nacts of God) or engages in fraud or other misconduct during the course of such relationship, we may need to seek alternative third party service\nproviders, or discontinue certain products or programs in their entirety. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, situations\nwhere we have been held directly or indirectly responsible, or were otherwise subject to liability, for the inability of our third party service\nproviders to perform services for our customers on a timely basis or at all or for actions of third parties undertaken on behalf of the Bank or\notherwise in connection with the Bank's arrangement with such third parties. Any such responsibility or liability in the future may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, including the operations of the Bank and its divisions, and financial results.\nIn any event, our agreements with, and management practices with respect to, third parties have been and may continue to be scrutinized by our\nregulators, and our regulators could raise an issue with, or object to, any term or provision in such an agreement or any action taken by such\nthird party vis-à-vis the Bank's operations or customers, resulting in a material adverse effect to us including, but not limited to, the imposition of\nfines and/or penalties and the material restructuring or termination of such agreement. Moreover, if our regulators examine our third-party service\nproviders and find questionable or illegal acts or practices, our regulators could require us to restructure or terminate our agreements with such\nproviders or enhance management and risk oversight practices with respect thereto.\nAdditionally, although our network of tax preparation partners is expansive, it is possible that our EROs may choose to offer tax-related products\nof other companies that provide products and services similar to the Bank's if such other companies offer superior pricing or for other competitive\nreasons.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our deposits, total assets and income from deposit accounts that we generate through Payments' customer\nrelationships, of which a limited number of program manager relationships are particularly significant to our operations.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our deposits, total assets and income from deposit accounts we generate through program manager\nrelationships between third parties and Payments. If one of these significant program manager relationships were to be terminated or there is a\nsignificant decrease in revenues or deposits associated with any of these business relationships, it could materially reduce our deposits, assets\nand income. Similarly, if a significant program manager relationship was not replaced, we may be required to seek higher-rate funding sources\nas compared to the existing program manager relationship or see a significant reduction in fee income.\n43\nTable of Contents\nWe are exposed to fraud losses from customer accounts.\nFraudulent activity involving our products may lead to customer disputed transactions, for which we may be liable under banking regulations and\npayment network rules. Our fraud detection and risk control mechanisms may not prevent all fraudulent or illegal activity. To the extent we incur\nlosses from disputed transactions, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to settlement and other losses from payments customers.\nOur cardholders can incur charges in excess of the funds available in their accounts, and we may become liable for these overdrafts. While we\ndecline authorization attempts for amounts that exceed the available balance in a cardholder's account, the application of card association rules,\nthe timing of the settlement of transactions and the assessment of the card's monthly maintenance fee, among other things, can result in\noverdrawn accounts.\nIn addition, we face settlement risks from our distributors and banking partners, which may increase during an economic downturn. Depending\non contract terms, we may prefund partner accounts. If a partner becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits fraud or otherwise fails to\nremit proceeds to our card issuing bank from the sales of our products and services, we are liable for any amounts owed to our customers. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had assets subject to settlement risk of $365.9 million.\nFor one of our programs, the Company pays servicing fees which are primarily offset by estimated card breakage. For cards issued prior to\nJanuary of 2020, if consumers spend more than projected over the life of the card programs, the Company could experience a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Funding Activities – Deposits” for further breakdown of balances as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. We are not insured against these settlement or partner risks.\nOur business strategy includes plans for organic growth, and our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected if we fail to\ngrow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nAs part of our general growth strategy, we expect to continue to pursue organic growth, while also continuing to evaluate potential acquisitions\nand expansion opportunities that we believe provide a strategic or geographic fit with our business. Although we have experienced significant\ngrowth in our assets and revenues, we may not be able to sustain our historical growth rate or be able to grow at all. We believe that our future\norganic growth will depend on competitive factors and on the ability of our senior management to continue to maintain a robust system of internal\ncontrols and procedures and manage a growing number of customer relationships. See \"We operate in an extremely competitive market, and\nour business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\" We may not be able to implement changes or improvements to these internal\ncontrols and procedures in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Our growth strategy\nmay divert management from our existing business and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and\noperational infrastructure and, if we are unable to effectively manage our growth, including to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could be\nmaterially and adversely affected. In addition, acquiring other companies may involve risks such as exposure to potential asset quality issues,\ndisruption to our normal business activities and diversion of management’s time and attention due to integration and conversion efforts.\nConsequently, continued organic growth, if achieved, may place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions, or the failure to consummate such transactions, could disrupt our business and harm our financial\ncondition and may not yield the intended benefits.\nWe have historically and may continue to evaluate, consider and engage in strategic transactions, combinations, acquisitions and dispositions.\nThese transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. Identifying appropriate business\nopportunities can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be successful in negotiating favorable terms and/or consummating the\ntransaction. Even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain the benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such\ntransaction, including:\n• increased regulatory and compliance requirements;\n• implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;\n• diversion of management time and focus from operation of our then-existing business;\n44\nTable of Contents\n• integration and coordination of product, sales, marketing, program and systems management functions;\n• integration of the acquired company’s systems and operations generally with ours;\n• integration of employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n• loss or termination, including costs associated with the termination or replacement, of employees;\n• liability for activities of the acquired company prior to the acquisition, including violations of law, commercial disputes and tax and other\nknown and unknown liabilities; and\n• increased litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims brought by terminated employees,\ncustomers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nAccordingly, any acquisition, disposition or other strategic transaction may not be successful, may not benefit our business strategy or may not\notherwise result in the intended benefits. It also may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of these\ntransactions, and those benefits and synergies may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely\naffect our business and operating results.\nAdditionally, any acquisition of target financial institutions or other banking assets by us may require approval by, and cooperation from, a\nnumber of governmental regulatory agencies, as well as state banking regulators. Such regulators could delay or deny our applications or\nregulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us.\nTo the extent we pay the consideration for any future strategic acquisition in cash, it would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other\npurposes. Future strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent\nliabilities, amortization expenses, or goodwill impairment charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and negatively impact our\nstockholders.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we have implemented, and in the future, may implement new lines of business or offer new financial products or services\nwithin existing lines of business. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with developing and marketing new lines of business or new\nproducts or services, particularly in instances where markets are not fully developed or when the laws and regulations regarding a new product\nare not mature, and we may be required to invest significant time, management and capital resources in connection with such new lines of\nbusiness or new products or services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business or new products or\nservices may not be achieved. In addition, price and profitability targets for new lines of business or new products or services may not prove\nfeasible, as we, the Bank or any of the Bank's business lines may need to price products and services on less advantageous terms than\nanticipated to retain or attract customers. External factors, such as regulatory reception, compliance with regulations and guidance, developing\nlaws and regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of\nbusiness or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business or new product or service may be expensive to implement and\ncould also have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the\ndevelopment and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could reduce our revenues and potentially generate\nlosses.\nAn impairment charge of goodwill or other intangibles could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom previous acquisitions, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets included in its consolidated assets. Under GAAP we are required to\ntest the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at least annually or sooner if events occur that indicate impairment could exist. These\nevents or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal and regulatory factors, competition, a decrease in our\nstock price and market capitalization over a sustained period of time, a sustained decline in a reporting unit's fair value or other operating\nperformance indicators. GAAP requires us to assign and then test goodwill at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of our reporting unit is less\nthan its net book value, the shortfall is recognized as impairment and is recognized in current earnings. In addition, if the revenue and cash flows\ngenerated from any of our other acquired intangible assets is not sufficient to support its net book value, we may be required to record an\nimpairment charge. The estimation of fair value involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. The amount of any\nimpairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the\nperiod in which the charge is taken.\n45\nTable of Contents\nWe may incur losses due to fraudulent and negligent acts, as well as errors, by third parties or our employees.\nWe may incur losses due to fraudulent or negligent acts, misconduct or errors on the part of third parties with which we do business, our\nemployees and individuals and entities unaffiliated with us, including unauthorized wire and automated clearinghouse transactions, the theft of\ncustomer data, customer fraud concerning the value of any relevant collateral, identity theft, errors in a customer's tax return, tax return fraud,\nthe counterfeiting of cards and \"skimming\" (whereby a skimmer reads a debit card's encoded mag stripe and a camera records the PIN that is\nentered by a customer), malicious social engineering schemes (where people are asked to provide a prepaid card or reload product in order to\nobtain a loan or purchase goods or services) and collusion between participants in the card system to act illegally. Additionally, our employees\ncould hide unauthorized activities from us, engage in improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers, or improperly use\nconfidential information. There can be no assurances that the Bank's program to monitor fraud and other activities will be able to detect all\ninstances of such conduct or that, even if such conduct is detected, we, the Bank, our customers or the third parties with which we do business,\nincluding the ATM networks and card payment industry in which the Bank participates, will not be the victims of such activities. Even a single\nsignificant instance of fraud, misconduct or other error could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of\nour cards and other products and services, cause retail distributors or their customers to cease doing business with us or them, or could lead to\ngreater regulation that would increase our compliance costs. Such activities could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions, including\nsignificant monetary fines, and civil claims which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches involving us, the Bank or any third parties with which we do business could expose us to liability and litigation, adversely affecting\nour reputation and operating revenues.\nIn connection with our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of sensitive business and personally identifiable information, including\nsocial security numbers of our customers and other personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, on our data systems.\nWe and the third parties with which we conduct business are subject to security breaches, which may be due to the failure of our data encryption\ntechnologies or otherwise, involving the receipt, transmission, and storage of confidential customer and other personally identifiable information,\nincluding account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, or other malicious code, cyberattacks, or other events, any of which may\narise from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or from accidental technological failure. If one or more of these\nevents occurs, it could result in the disclosure of confidential customer information, impairment of our ability to provide products and services to\nour customers, damage to our reputation with our customers and the market, additional costs (such as costs for repairing systems or adding new\npersonnel or protection technologies), regulatory penalties, and financial losses for us, our customers and other third parties. Such events could\nalso cause interruptions or malfunctions in the operations of our customers, or other third parties with which we engage in business. Such events\ncould also damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business, which could lead to loss of customers and\nbusiness opportunities and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks have increased as a result of greater reliance on remote working, and are expected to\nremain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, the proliferation of malicious actors\ninternationally, and the expanding use of technology-based products and services by us and our customers. Cybersecurity risk and other\nsecurity matters are also a major focus of regulatory authorities. We can provide no assurances that the safeguards we have in place or may\nimplement in the future will prevent all unauthorized infiltrations or breaches and that we will not suffer losses related to a security breach in the\nfuture, which losses may be material. In addition, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our protective measures or to\ninvestigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures.\nFailure to comply satisfactorily with certain privacy and data protection laws, regulations, and standards to which we are subject could adversely\naffect our reputation and operating revenues.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, regulations and standards. For example, the largest credit card\nassociations in the world created the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (the \"PCI DSS\"), a multifaceted standard that includes\ndata security management, policies and procedures as well as other protective measures to protect the nonpublic personal information of\ncardholders. These laws, regulations and standards are rapidly evolving and increasing in complexity and could have a significant impact on our\ncurrent and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use,\n46\nTable of Contents\nsharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and some current or planned business activities. Complying with\nthese laws, regulations and standards may increase our operational costs, restrict our ability to provide certain products and services or have an\neffect on the profitability of one or more of our business divisions. Additionally, our failure, or perceived failure, to comply with applicable laws\nand regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal information could result in regulatory sanctions, including\nfinancial penalties, regulatory investigations, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals and damage to our reputation, any\nof which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business.\nOur reputation and financial condition may be harmed by system failures, computer viruses and other technological interruptions to our operations.\nWe rely heavily upon information systems and other operating technologies to efficiently operate and manage our business, including to process\ntransactions through the Internet, including, in particular, in our Partner Solutions business line. Were there to be a failure or a significant\nimpairment in the operation of any of such systems, we may need to develop alternative processes, including to comply with customer safeguard\nprotocols, during which time revenues and profitability may be lower, and there can be no assurance that we could develop or find such an\nalternative on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any such disruption in the information systems and other operating technologies utilized by the\nBank or its divisions, including due to infiltration by hackers or other intruders, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical break-ins, or\ndamage from fire, could also result in negative publicity, have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain or retain customers, and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAgency, technological, or human error could lead to tax refund processing delays, which could adversely affect our reputation and operating revenues.\nWe and our tax preparation partners rely on the IRS, technology, and employees when processing and preparing tax refunds and tax-related\nproducts and services. Any delays during the processing or preparation period could result in reputational damage to us or to our tax preparation\npartners, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and tax-related products and services, either of which could have a significant\nadverse impact on our operating revenues and future growth prospects.\nThe Commercial Finance business line generates government-backed loans funded by the Bank, any of which could be negatively impacted by a\nvariety of factors.\nThe Commercial Finance business line originates loans backed by numerous state and federal government agencies. Risks inherent in the\nBank's participation in such programs, through its Commercial Finance business line, include: (i) some of these programs guarantee only a\nportion of the commercial loan made by the Bank; as such, if the borrower defaults and losses exceed those guaranteed by the government\nagency, the Bank could realize significant losses; (ii) certain programs, including some guaranteed by the United States Department of\nAgriculture, limit the geographic scope of such loans; as such, if the Commercial Finance business line is not able to market these loans to\npotential borrowers, the Bank's share in this market may be negatively impacted; (iii) the intended beneficiaries of such loan programs may\nexperience a contraction in their credit quality due to local, national, or global economic events or because of factors specific to their business,\nincluding, for example, businesses dependent upon the farming and agriculture industry; as such, any negative impact to certain commercial\nbusiness lines designed to benefit from such government-sponsored loan programs could constrict the Bank's business in these areas; and (iv)\nnearly all of these guaranteed loan programs are subject to an appropriations process, either at the legislative or regulatory level; this means that\nfunds that may be currently available to guarantee loans or portions of loans could be limited or eliminated in their entirety with little or no\nadvance warning.\nAgreements between the Bank and third parties to market and service Bank-originated consumer loans may subject the Bank to credit, fraud and\nother risks, as well as claims from regulatory agencies and third parties that, if successful, could negatively impact the Bank's current and future\nbusiness.\nThe Bank has entered into various agreements with unaffiliated third parties (\"Marketers\"), whereby the Marketers will market and service\nunsecured consumer loans underwritten and originated by the Bank. These agreements present potential increased credit, operational, and\nreputational risks. Because the loans originated under such programs are unsecured, in the event a borrower does not repay the loan in\naccordance with its terms or otherwise defaults on the loan, the Bank may not be able to recover from the borrower an amount sufficient to pay\nany\n47\nTable of Contents\nremaining balance on the loan. See \"If our actual loan and lease losses exceed our allowance for credit losses, our net income will decrease.\"\nWe may also become subject to claims by regulatory agencies, customers, or other third parties due to the conduct of the third parties with which\nthe Bank operates such lending programs if such conduct is deemed not to comply with applicable laws in connection with the marketing and\nservicing of loans originated pursuant to these programs.\nCertain types of these arrangements have been challenged both in the courts and in regulatory actions. In these actions, plaintiffs have generally\nargued that the \"true lender\" is the marketer and that the intent of such lending program is to evade state usury and loan licensing laws. Other\ncases have also included other claims, including racketeering and other state law claims, in their challenge of such programs.\nIn 2020, the OCC issued final rules designed to clarify when a national bank such as the Bank will be considered the “true lender” in such\nrelationships (the \"True Lender Rule\"). In June 2021, the True Lender Rule was repealed and the OCC prohibited from issuing any replacement\nof the True Lender Rule absent Congressional authorization. In the wake of the repeal of the True Lender Rule, several states have announced\ntheir intention to broaden oversight of non-bank fintech lenders, and several states have adopted legislation and guidance regarding \"true\nlenders.\" Additionally, certain parties have initiated litigation in order to obtain court guidance on how particular jurisdictions may weigh loan\nprogram facts and rule on “true lender” challenges. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission\nhave each announced their intention to explore their authority to supervise nonbank lending partnerships in markets for consumer financial\nproducts and services.\nConsequently, state and federal regulatory authorities may proceed on different paths to promulgate “true lender” restrictions, and – absent\nbinding court rulings or direct legislative action – impacted parties may have little to no advance notice of new restrictions and compliance\nobligations. In the absence of applicable laws or regulations addressing these matters, true lender disputes will be determined on a case-by-\ncase basis, informed by differing state laws and the facts in each instance. There can be no assurance that lawsuits or regulatory actions in\nconnection with any such lending programs the Bank has entered, or will enter, into will not be brought in the future. If a regulatory agency,\nconsumer advocate group, or other third party were to bring successful action against the Bank or any of the third parties with which the Bank\noperates such lending programs, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe OCC's grant of bank charters to fintech companies and special purpose fintech charter could present a market risk to us generally and the\nPartner Solutions business line specifically.\nThe OCC announced on July 31, 2018 that it would begin to accept and evaluate charters for entities that wanted to conduct certain components\nof a banking business pursuant to a federal charter, known as a \"special purpose national bank\" (\"SPNB\") charter. Intended to promote\neconomic opportunity and spur financial innovation, SPNBs may engage in paying checks, lending money and taking deposits. While the OCC\nhas not granted any SPNB charters as of the date of this filing, it has granted national bank charters to companies that were previously non-bank\nfintech companies.\nIf, in the future, the OCC determines to grant any SPNB applications or continues to grant bank charters to fintech applicants, recipients of such\ncharters may enter the U.S. payments market, BaaS solutions market, and other business lines in which the Bank operates, which could\nincrease the competition we face and have a material adverse effect on the Bank and the Partner Solutions business line.\nThe loss or transition of key members of our senior management team or key employees in the Bank's divisions, or our inability to attract and retain\nqualified personnel, could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior executive management team and other key employees.\nTheir experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate key management and operating personnel. The loss of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business.\nManagement transitions may create uncertainty and involve a diversion of resources and management attention, be disruptive to our daily\noperations or impact public or market perception, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate effectively or execute our strategies\nand result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs we continue to develop and expand our operations, we may require personnel with different skills and experiences, with a sound\nunderstanding of our business and the industries in which we operate. The competition for\n48\nTable of Contents\nqualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of any of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract,\nretain, and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe regularly assess our investments in technology, and changes in technology could be costly.\nThe fintech industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace. To keep up with our competition, we regularly evaluate technology to\ndetermine whether it may help us compete on a cost-effective basis. This is especially true with respect to our Partner Solutions business line,\nwhich requires significant expenditures to exploit technology and to develop new products and services to meet customers' needs. The cost of\ninvesting in, implementing and maintaining such technology is high, and there can be no assurance, given the fast pace of change and\ninnovation, that our technology, either purchased or developed internally, will meet our needs, in a timely, cost-effective manner or at all. During\nthe course of implementing new technology into our or the Bank's operations, we may experience system interruptions and failures. In addition,\nthere can be no assurances that we will recognize, in a timely manner or at all, the benefits that we may expect as a result of our implementing\nnew technology into our operations. In connection with our implementation of new lines of business, offering of new financial products or\nacquisitions, we may experience significant, one-time or recurring technology-related costs. If we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with\nexisting and future technology needs, our business, financial results, or reputation could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to receive dividends from the Bank could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends on our common stock, interest on our trust\npreferred securities and principal on our debt.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Our primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank.\nThese dividends are a principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock, interest on our trust preferred securities and interest and\nprincipal on our debt. Various laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay us, as further described in Part I, Item 1\n\"Business - Regulation and Supervision - Bank Regulation and Supervision - Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions\" of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Such limitations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and on our ability to pay dividends on\ncommon stock. Additionally, if the Bank's earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels,\nwe may not be able to make dividend payments to our common shareholders or make payments on our trust preferred securities.\nUnclaimed funds represented by unused value on the cards presents compliance and other risks.\nThe concept of escheatment involves the reporting and delivery of property to states that is abandoned when its rightful owner cannot be readily\nlocated and/or identified. In the context of prepaid cards, the customer funds represented by such cards can sometimes be \"abandoned\" or\nunused for the relevant period of time set forth in each applicable state's abandoned property laws. The Partner Solutions business line utilizes\nautomated programs designed to comply with applicable escheatment laws and regulations. There appears, however, to be a movement among\nsome state regulators to more broadly interpret definitions in escheatment statutes and regulations than in the past. State regulators may choose\nto initiate collection or other litigation action against prepaid card issuers, like Payments, for unreported abandoned property, and such actions\nmay seek to assess fines and penalties and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Regulation of the Company and the Bank\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and our failure to comply with laws and regulations, or changes in laws and regulations to which we\nare subject, may adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and the Bank operate in a highly regulated environment, and we are subject to extensive regulation (including, among others, the Dodd-\nFrank Act, the Basel III Capital Rules, the Bank Secrecy Act and other AML rules), supervision, and examination, including by the OCC and the\nFederal Reserve, our primary banking regulators. In addition, the Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC and, to a lesser degree, the Bureau.\nPrepaid card issuers like the Bank are also subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny based on AML and Bank Secrecy Act concerns, which\nscrutiny could result in higher compliance costs. See Part I, Item 1 \"Business - Regulation and Supervision\" herein. Many of the laws, rules,\nregulations and supervisory policies governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our depositors, our customers, the\nfinancial system and the FDIC insurance fund, not our stockholders\n49\nTable of Contents\nor other creditors and are subject to regular modification and change. A considerable amount of management time and resources are devoted to\noversight of, and development, implementation and execution of controls and procedures relating to, compliance with these laws, regulations\nand policies.\nBanking regulatory authorities have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including, but not limited, to\nthe imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution, and the adequacy of an institution's\nallowance for credit losses. If any of our banking regulators takes informal or formal supervisory action or pursues an enforcement action, any\nrequired corrective steps could result in us being subject to additional regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, a consent order,\nenhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. Failure to maintain and implement adequate policies, procedures, and systems to comply\nwith these regulations could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nAny new requirements or rules, changes in such requirements or rules, changes to or new interpretations of existing requirements or rules,\nfailure to follow requirements or rules, or future lawsuits or rulings could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, require\nsignificant systems redevelopment, render our products or services less profitable or obsolete or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, any changes in the U.S. tax laws as a result of pending tax\nlegislation in the U.S. Congress or otherwise may adversely impact our tax refund processing and settlement business, which could reduce\ncustomer demand for our strategic partner's refund advance products, thereby reducing the volume of refund advance loans that we may offer.\nIn addition, future regulations could increase the assessment rate we are required to pay to the FDIC, adversely affecting our earnings. It is very\ndifficult to predict future changes in regulation or the competitive impact that any such changes would have on our business.\nThe Bureau's rulemaking and enforcement of prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices have directly impacted, and may continue to\nimpact, the Bank's consumer financial products and service offerings.\nThe Bureau has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of \"federal consumer financial laws, and to\nprevent evasions thereof\" with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. We cannot predict the\nimpact the Bureau's future actions, including any exercise of its UDAAP authority, will have on the banking industry broadly or us and the Bank\nspecifically. Notwithstanding that insured depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or less (such as the Bank) will continue to be\nsupervised and examined by their primary federal regulators, the full reach and impact of the Bureau's broad rulemaking powers and UDAAP\nauthority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services are currently unknown. The Bureau has\ninitiated enforcement actions against a variety of bank and non-bank market participants with respect to a number of consumer financial\nproducts and services that has resulted in those participants expending significant time, money and resources to adjust to the initiatives being\npursued by the Bureau. Such enforcement actions may serve as precedent for how the Bureau interprets and enforces consumer protection\nlaws, which may result in the imposition of higher standards of compliance with such laws and, as a result, limit or restrict the Bank with respect\nto its consumer product offerings. See \"Business - Regulation and Supervision - Bank Regulation and Supervision\" in Part I, Item 1 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nRegulatory scrutiny of bank provision of partner solutions and related technology considerations has increased.\nWe provide products and services to third parties through issuing, acquiring, digital payments, financial institution solutions, credit solutions, and\nprofessional tax solutions. The third parties that use these partner solutions, and with which we often partner in marketing efforts, are typically\nconsidered fintech companies but may also include other financial intermediaries. Federal bank regulators are increasingly focused on the risks\nrelated to bank and fintech company partnerships, raising concerns regarding risk management, oversight, internal controls, information security,\nchange management, and information technology operational resilience. This focus is demonstrated by recent regulatory enforcement actions\nagainst other banks that have allegedly not adequately addressed these concerns while growing their BaaS offerings, as well as by a request for\ninformation by the federal banking regulators on bank-fintech arrangements. While we believe we are a leader in managing, monitoring and\noverseeing partner solutions relationships with third parties and corresponding technologies, we could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny\nwith respect to that portion of our business.\n50\nTable of Contents\nIncreased scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders with respect to ESG practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new\nor additional risks.\nAs a regulated financial institution and a publicly traded company, we are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and\nother stakeholders related to ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds, and influential investors are\nincreasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to climate risk, hiring practices, diversity, health and safety and human rights.\nFailure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact the\nCompany’s reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and stock price. Both recently adopted and pending government regulations\nwill result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.\nAdditionally, ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding ESG, including climate risk, management and practices may\nresult in higher compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs. To the extent that we or our customers experience increases in costs,\nincluding with respect to compliance with any additional regulatory or disclosure requirements or expectations, reductions in the value of assets,\nconstraints on operations or similar concerns driven by changes in ESG oversight and regulation, our results of operations, financial condition,\nand business could be adversely affected.\nWe will be subject to heightened regulatory requirements if our total assets exceed $10 billion as of December 31 of any calendar year.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total assets were $7.55 billion. While we intend to remain under the $10 billion asset level, our total assets could\nexceed $10 billion at the end of this or a future calendar year. In addition to our current regulatory requirements, banks with $10 billion or more in\ntotal assets are, among other things: examined directly by the Bureau with respect to various federal consumer financial laws; subject to reduced\ndividends on the Bank’s holdings of Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis common stock; subject to limits on interchange fees pursuant to the\nDurbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act; subject to certain enhanced prudential standards; no longer treated as a “small institution” for FDIC\ndeposit insurance assessment purposes; and no longer eligible to elect to be subject to the Community Bank Leverage ratio. Compliance with\nthese additional ongoing requirements may necessitate additional personnel, the design and implementation of additional internal controls, or the\nincurrence of other significant expenses, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of\noperations. Our regulators may also consider our preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements in the course of examining our\noperations generally or when considering any request from us or the Bank.\nWe will become subject to reduced interchange income and could face related adverse business consequences if our total assets exceed $10 billion\nas of December 31 of any calendar year.\nDebit card interchange fee restrictions set forth in Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which is\nknown as the Durbin Amendment, as implemented by regulations of the Federal Reserve, cap the maximum debit interchange fee that a debit\ncard issuer may receive per transaction. Debit card issuers with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from these\ninterchange fee restrictions. The exemption for small issuers ceases to apply as of July 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the\ndebit card issuer has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more at calendar year-end. While we intend to remain under the $10 billion asset\nlevel, and have implemented an off-balance sheet strategy for deposits, growth in deposits and associated loan growth could result in such an\nincrease on our balance sheet. Any reduction in interchange income as a result of the loss of the exemption for small issuers under the Durbin\nAmendment could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our loss of eligibility\nunder the exemption for small issuers could adversely affect or reduce our ability to maintain certain of our fee-sharing prepaid card\npartnerships, which have the right to terminate our agreement with respect to certain financial services under such circumstances.\nAny change in the Bank's ability to gather brokered deposits may adversely impact the Bank.\nFailure to maintain the Bank's status as a \"well capitalized\" institution could have an adverse effect on us, and our ability to fund our operations.\nThe Bank relies on brokered deposits to assist in funding its loan and other financing products. Should the Bank ever fail to be well capitalized in\nthe future as a result of not meeting the well capitalized requirements or the imposition of an individual minimum capital requirement or similar\nformal requirement, then, the Bank would be prohibited, absent waiver from the FDIC, from utilizing brokered deposits (i.e., no insured\ndepository\n51\nTable of Contents\ninstitution that is deemed to be less than \"well capitalized\" may accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC). In\nsuch event, such a result could produce material adverse consequences for the Bank with respect to liquidity and could also have material\nadverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, depending on the Bank's condition in the future and its reliance on\nthese deposits as a source of funding, the FDIC could increase the surcharge on our brokered deposits. If we are ever required to pay higher\nsurcharge assessments with respect to these deposits, such payments could be material and therefore could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes to FDIC regulations regarding brokered deposits or interpretations of such\nregulations by federal banking agencies could have an adverse impact on the Bank’s ability to accept brokered deposits. On July 30, 2024, the\nFDIC released a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise its regulations regarding brokered deposits, which would significantly change the\nFDIC’s current approach to brokered deposits. If the FDIC adopts these amendments as proposed, it could have an adverse impact on the\nBank’s ability to accept brokered deposits. Additionally, brokered deposits are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and, accordingly, can\nbe a more volatile source of funding. Use of brokered deposits involves the risk that growth supported by such deposits would be halted, or the\nBank’s liquidity adversely impacted, if the rates offered by the Bank were less than those offered by other institutions seeking such deposits, or if\ndepositors were to perceive a decline in the Bank’s safety and soundness, or both.\nAs a BHC, we are required to serve as a \"source of strength\" for the Bank.\nFederal banking law codifies a requirement that a BHC (like us) act as a financial \"source of strength\" for its FDIC-insured depository institution\nsubsidiaries (like the Bank) and permits the OCC, as the Bank's primary federal regulator, to request reports from us to assess our ability to\nserve as a source of strength for the Bank and to enforce compliance with these statutory requirements. See Part I, Item 1 \"Business -\nRegulation and Supervision - Holding Company Regulation and Supervision.\" Given the power provided to the federal banking agencies, we, as\na source of strength for the Bank, may be required to contribute capital to the Bank when we might not otherwise voluntarily choose to do so.\nSpecifically, the imposition of such financial requirements might require us to raise additional capital to support the Bank at a time when it is not\notherwise prudent for us to do so, including on terms that are not typical or favorable to us. Further, any capital provided by us to the Bank would\nbe subordinate to others with an interest in the Bank, including the Bank's depositors. In addition, in the event of our bankruptcy at a time when\nwe had a commitment to one of the Bank's regulators to maintain the capital of the Bank, the regulators' claims against us may be entitled to\npriority status over other obligations.\nIf we fail to maintain sufficient capital, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and compliance with regulatory requirements would be\nadversely affected.\nBoth we and the Bank are required to meet regulatory capital requirements and otherwise need to maintain sufficient liquidity to support recent\nand future growth. We have continued to experience considerable growth recently, having increased our assets from $2.53 billion at September\n30, 2015 to $7.55 billion at September 30, 2024, primarily due to strategic transactions, such as the Crestmark Acquisition, through participation\nin government stimulus programs such as the EIP, and through organic growth. Asset growth, diversification of our lending business, expansion\nof our financial product offerings and other changes in our asset mix continue to require higher levels of capital, which management believes\nmay not be met through earnings retention alone. Our ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed in the future, to meet such regulatory\ncapital requirements and liquidity needs will depend on conditions in the capital markets, general economic conditions, the performance and\nprospects of our business and a number of other factors, many of which are outside of our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to\nraise additional capital if needed or raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory\nrequirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough we comply with all current applicable capital requirements, we may be subject to more stringent regulatory capital requirements in the\nfuture, and we may need additional capital in order to meet those requirements. If we or the Bank fail to meet applicable minimum capital\nrequirements or cease to be well capitalized, such failure would cause us and the Bank to be subject to regulatory restrictions and could\nadversely affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common\nstock and/or repurchase shares, our ability to make distributions on our trust preferred securities, our ability to make acquisitions, and our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition, generally.\n52\nTable of Contents\nChanges in federal, state, and local tax laws, interpretations of existing tax laws, or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax\nburden or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal state and local levels. The governing tax laws and applicable tax rates vary by jurisdiction and are\nsubject to interpretation and changes. We may be subject to examination by the tax authorities and such authorities may disagree with our tax\npositions, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Additionally, the amount of tax payable in a given financial statement period may\nbe impacted by sudden or unforeseen changes in tax laws, changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdictions, or changes to\nexisting accounting rules or regulations. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted in December 2017, made broad and\ncomplex changes to the U.S. tax code.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock has been volatile in the past, and several factors, including factors outside of our control and\nunrelated to our performance, could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include:\n• announcements of developments related to our business;\n• the initiation, pendency or outcome of litigation, regulatory reviews, inquiries and investigations, and any related adverse publicity;\n• fluctuations in our results of operations;\n• sales of substantial amounts of our securities into the marketplace;\n• general conditions in the financial services industry or the worldwide economy;\n• operating and stock price performance of comparable companies, as deemed by investors;\n• geopolitical conditions, such as acts or threats of terrorism, military conflicts, the effects (or perceived effects) of pandemics and trade\nrelations;\n• a shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts' expectations;\n• lack of an active trading market for the common stock;\n• new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n• changes in analysts' recommendations or projections; and\n• announcement of new acquisitions, dispositions or other projects by the Company or our competitors.\nGeneral market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price\nmay not be indicative of future market prices. Stock price volatility also may make it more difficult for our stockholders to resell their common\nstock when desired. General market fluctuations, industry factors, political conditions, and general economic conditions and events, such as\neconomic slowdowns, recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could cause our common stock price to decrease regardless of\noperating results. Further, volatility in our stock price also impacts the value of our equity compensation, which may impact our ability to recruit\nand retain employees.\nMoreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market\nprice of its securities. In the future, we could be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert\nmanagement’s attention and resources from our normal business.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, or by any\nother public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently subject to risks, including those described in this \"Risk Factors\"\nsection, and is subject to forces that affect the financial markets in general. As a result, if you hold or acquire our common stock, it is possible\nthat you may lose all or a portion of your investment.\n53\nTable of Contents\nFuture sales or additional issuances of our capital stock may depress prices of shares of our common stock or otherwise dilute the book value of\nshares then outstanding.\nSales of a substantial amount of our capital stock in the public market or the issuance of a significant number of shares could adversely affect\nthe market price for shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we were authorized to issue up to 90,000,000 shares of common\nstock, of which 24,847,353 shares were outstanding, and 3,769 shares were held as treasury stock. We were also authorized to issue up to\n3,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 3,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock, none of which were outstanding or reserved for\nissuance. Future sales or additional issuances of stock may affect the market price for shares of our common stock.\nChanges in accounting policies or accounting standards, or changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect\nhow we report our financial results and condition.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding our financial results and condition. From time to time, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of\nour financial statements. In addition, those that set accounting standards and those that interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB,\nthe SEC, banking regulators, and our outside auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these\nstandards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our\ncontrol, can be difficult to predict, and could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. We may be required to apply a\nnew or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently and retroactively, which may result in us being required to restate\nprior period financial statements, which restatements may reflect material changes. Such changes could also require us to incur additional\npersonnel and technology costs.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which\ncould harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.\nWe incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and\nregulations affecting public companies. As a SEC reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, which requires annual management and independent registered public accounting firm assessments of\nthe effectiveness of our internal controls. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so\nthat we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated\nfrequently. We have historically dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to implement our internal financial and accounting controls\nand procedures. Substantial work may continue to be required to further implement, document, assess, test, and, if necessary, remediate our\nsystem of internal controls. We may also need to retain additional finance and accounting personnel in the future.\nControl failures, including failures in our controls over financial reporting, could result from human error, fraud, breakdowns in information and\ncomputer systems, lapses in operating processes, or natural or man-made disasters. If a significant control failure or business interruption were\nto occur, it could materially damage our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to foresee, prevent, mitigate, reverse,\nor repair the negative effects of such failures or interruptions.\nWe have identified control deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting in the past, and if our internal controls over financial\nreporting are not effective in the future, we may be unable to issue our financial statements in a timely manner, we may be unable to obtain the\nrequired audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner, or we may\notherwise be unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Additionally, our common stock listing on the NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market® could be suspended or terminated and our stock price could materially suffer. In addition, we or members of our\nmanagement team could be subject to investigation and sanction by the SEC or other regulatory authorities and to claims by stockholders, which\ncould impose significant additional costs on us and divert our management's attention. See also Part II. \"Item 9A. Controls and Procedures -\nInherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for inherent limitations in a control system.\n54\nTable of Contents\nFederal regulations and our organizational documents may inhibit a takeover, prevent a transaction you favor or limit our growth opportunities,\ncausing the market price of our common stock to decline.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and federal regulations could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. In addition, we may need to obtain approval from regulatory\nauthorities before we can acquire control of any other company. Such approvals could involve significant expenses related to diligence, legal\ncompliance, and the submission of required applications and could be conditioned on acts or practices that limit or otherwise constrain our\noperations.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nWe have historically paid a quarterly dividend to stockholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any\npayment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, regulatory review, and\nother factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.\nCatastrophic events could negatively impact our operations, the operations of third parties with which we do business, and the communities in which\nwe do business.\nCatastrophic events (including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, pandemics, terrorism and other geopolitical events), which are\nbeyond our control, could have an adverse impact on the Bank's ability and the ability of our vendors and other third parties with which we do\nbusiness, to provide necessary services to support the operation of the Bank and provide products and services to the Bank's customers.\nNatural disasters and severe weather conditions could harm our operations through interference with communications, including the interruption\nor loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede us from gathering deposits, originating loans, and processing and controlling the\nflow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. Although\ninsurance coverage may provide some protection in light of such events, there can be no assurance that any insurance proceeds would\nadequately compensate the Bank for the losses it incurred as a result of such events. See also \"Existing insurance policies may not adequately\nprotect us and our subsidiaries.\" Moreover, the damage caused by such events may not be directly compensable from insurance proceeds or\notherwise, such as damage to our reputation as a result of such events. Additionally, such catastrophic events may negatively impact economic\nactivity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we do business. Such catastrophic events\ncould each negatively impact our employees, our business operations or the stability of our deposit base, cause significant property damage,\nadversely impact the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interrupt our borrowers’ abilities to conduct their business in a manner to\nsupport their debt obligations, which could result in losses and increased provision for credit loss. There is no assurance that our business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery program can adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.\nLegal challenges to and regulatory investigations of our, or the Bank's, operations could have a significant material adverse effect on us.\nFrom time to time, we, the Bank or our other subsidiaries are subject to regulatory supervision and investigation, legal proceedings and claims in\nthe ordinary course of business. An adverse resolution in litigation or a regulatory action, including litigation or other actions brought by our\nshareholders, customers or another third party, such as a state attorney general or one of our regulators, could result in substantial damages or\notherwise negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition. Moreover, our involvement in such matters, even if the matters are\nultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation, result in substantial expense, and divert management\nattention from the operations of our business. See Part I, Item 1 \"Business - Regulation and Supervision\" and Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings.\"\nOur reputation and business could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, including as a result of negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity or reputational harm can result from\nactual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation,\ninadequate protection of customer data, illegal or unauthorized acts taken by third parties that supply products or services to us or the Bank, the\nbehavior of our employees, the customers with whom we have chosen to do business, and negative publicity for other financial institutions.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely impact our ability to attract new, and maintain existing, loan\n55\nTable of Contents\nand deposit customers, employees and business relationships, and, particularly with respect to our Partner Solutions business line, could result\nin the imposition of new regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. Such damage\ncould also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nExisting insurance policies may not adequately protect us and our subsidiaries.\nFidelity, business interruption, cybersecurity, and property insurance policies are in place with respect to our operations. Should any event\ntriggering such policies occur, however, it is possible that our policies would not fully reimburse us for the losses we could sustain due to\ndeductible limits, policy limits, coverage limits, or other factors. We generally renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. If the cost of\ncoverage becomes too high, we may need to reduce our policy limits, increase the deductibles or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage\nin order to reduce the premiums to an acceptable amount.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nInformation Security Program\nPathward maintains a comprehensive Information Security Program to promote the principles of sound information security governance and to\nensure risk-taking activities are in line with the Company’s strategic objectives, risk appetite, and regulatory requirements. The Information\nSecurity Program governs the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, and defines the responsibilities of departments and individuals for\nsuch data. The Information Security Program is designed to protect information resources from a wide range of threats to ensure business\ncontinuity and minimize business risk.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nThe goal of the Information Security Program is to prevent cybersecurity incidents. The Information Security Program aligns to the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (\"NIST CSF\"). The Information Security Policy is designed to address\ncompliance by Pathward and its personnel with applicable laws and regulations. Information security controls are designed to follow the Center\nfor Internet Security (\"CIS\") controls framework. Policies and program standards that align with CIS and Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard (\"PCI-DSS\") are also in place.\nThe Information Security teams include experienced, highly qualified architects, engineers and analysts who support all aspects of cybersecurity\nincluding security architecture, identity and access management, vulnerability management, security operations, as well as governance, risk and\ncompliance. The majority of the Information Security staff holds at least one cybersecurity-related certification.\nPathward has a formal Enterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\") department. The Company’s Chief Risk Officer is responsible for developing and\nexecuting the risk framework and ERM plan for the Company. The Company has implemented a three lines of defense model. The first line of\ndefense (\"1LOD\") is responsible for owning, measuring, and managing the risks and controls. The second line of defense (\"2LOD\") is\nresponsible for monitoring risk and controls in support of management. The third line of defense (\"3LOD\") is the independent audit function.\nBased on the risk appetite of the Company, the ERM department monitors enterprise-wide risk and control profiles. The ERM department\nprovides monthly and quarterly risk reporting to management and the Board of Directors. The ERM department ensures accurate and timely risk\nassessments are prepared throughout the organization. The ERM department and compliance team also administer a documented regulatory\nchange control process when new and revised regulations need to be implemented.\n56\nTable of Contents\nRole of Management\nPathward’s Information Security Program is managed by the Company’s Chief Product and Technology Officer (“CPTO”) and Chief Information\nSecurity Officer (“CISO”). The current CPTO has over 30 years of experience in senior leadership positions in the areas of information\ntechnology, technology innovation and enterprise architecture, and has been recognized for various technology and leadership awards. The\ncurrent CISO reports to the CPTO and has extensive years of experience in information security both at Pathward and at other companies as\nwell as many years of executive management experience. The CISO regularly reports to executive management, the Risk Committee of the\nBoard of Directors (the “Board Risk Committee”) and the Board of Directors regarding all aspects of information security including cybersecurity\nrisk and incidents. The Information Technology Committee and Executive Risk Committee provide governance and oversight of the Information\nSecurity Program. These Committees convene at least four times annually, reporting significant activities and issues upward to the Board Risk\nCommittee and the Board of Directors as necessary.\nRole of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors has delegated oversight of all enterprise risks relevant to the Company, including information technology and\ncybersecurity risk, to the Board Risk Committee, which consists of three independent non-employee directors. The CISO provides quarterly\nupdates on information security and cybersecurity risk to the Board Risk Committee, as well as an annual cybersecurity overview and\ninformation security report to the full Board of Directors. The Risk Committee oversees the Information Security Program including through the\nannual review and approval of any material changes to the Information Security Policy.\nSecurity Awareness Training\nAll Pathward employees play a crucial role in cybersecurity defense. Pathward has implemented a security awareness training program that\nincludes annual mandatory training for employees and contractors as well as ongoing phishing resiliency testing. The security awareness\nprogram also includes periodic videos and educational articles that are shared with employees through a partnership with corporate\ncommunications.\nThird Party Risk Management Program\nThe Information Security third party risk management program is a piece of the overarching enterprise third party risk management program.\nThe Information Security team’s reviews of third parties include initial and periodic security assessments, documentation and audit report\nreviews, and consultation on any security enhancements recommended based on the results of the completed reviews.\nIncident Response Program\nManagement has developed and implemented a risk-based incident response program to minimize the impact to Pathward and its customers in\nthe event of an information security incident. The incident response program has defined protocols to declare and respond to an identified\nincident and includes appropriate containment and restoration strategies. Pathward maintains a documented Cybersecurity Incident Response\nPlan and has identified Information Technology and Information Security staff who are responsible for assisting with a data breach incident\nresponse event. Team members have defined roles, responsibilities and must participate in incident response training and walk-through events\nat least annually. Pathward has contracted with an incident response provider in the event of a security breach. In addition, Pathward has\nacquired a cybersecurity insurance policy.\nPathward has established a Crisis Management Team (\"CMT\"), which is comprised of executive leadership and key senior stakeholders and is\nengaged immediately following a cybersecurity incident. The CMT provides leadership and maintains ultimate executive level oversight during\neach phase of the incident.\nPathward has robust cybersecurity measures in place. Pathward is not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect Pathward, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, during the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2024. Yet, in this modern, evolving world cybersecurity remains a high risk regardless. For further information about the\ncybersecurity risks Pathward faces, and potential impacts, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.\n57\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

When\nexcluding the insurance premium finance loans of $800.1 million at September 30, 2023, total gross loans and leases at September 30,\n2024 increased $509.2 million, or 14%, when compared to September 30, 2023.\n• During the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 236,308 shares of common stock at an average share price of $63.44. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were 7,000,000 shares available for repurchase under the current common stock share repurchase program.\nSubsequent Events\nManagement has evaluated and identified subsequent events that occurred after September 30, 2024. See Note 20.

The\nCompany maintains its cash investments primarily in interest-bearing overnight deposits with the FHLB of Des Moines and the FRB.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any federal funds sold.\nThe total investment portfolio decreased $66.5 million to $1.77 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.84 billion at September 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s portfolio of securities customarily consists primarily of MBS, which have expected lives much shorter than the stated final\nmaturity, non-bank qualified obligations of states and political subdivisions, which mature in approximately 15 years or less, and other tax exempt\nmunicipal mortgage related pass through securities which have average lives much shorter than their stated final maturities. During the fiscal\nyear ended September 30, 2024, the Company made $3.5 million purchases of investment securities.\nThrough the Bank, the Company owns stock in the FHLB due to the Bank’s membership and participation in this banking system as well as\nstock in the FRB. The FHLB requires a level of stock investment based on a pre-determined formula. The Company’s investment in these stocks\nwas $36.0 million at September 30, 2024, an increase from $28.2 million at September 30, 2023, as purchases of FHLB membership stock were\npartially offset by redemptions during the fiscal year.\nLoans held for sale at September 30, 2024 totaled $688.9 million, increasing from $77.8 million at September 30, 2023. This increase was\nprimarily related to the commercial insurance premium finance portfolio moving to held for sale at September 30, 2024.\nTotal gross loans and leases totaled $4.08 billion at September 30, 2024, as compared to $4.37 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease\nwas primarily related to the commercial insurance premium finance portfolio moving to held for sale, partially offset by growth in commercial\nfinance loans excluding commercial insurance premium finance loans and warehouse finance loans. When excluding commercial insurance\npremium finance loans, total gross loan and leases at September 30, 2024 increased $509.2 million, or 14%, when compared to September 30,\n2023. See Note 3. Loans and Leases, Net to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which is included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCommercial finance loans, which comprised 81% of the Company's loan and lease portfolio, totaled $3.30 billion at September 30, 2024,\nreflecting a decrease of $427.6 million, or 11%, from September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the aforementioned commercial\ninsurance premium finance loans along with a decrease in lease financing. This decrease was partially offset by increases in term lending,\nasset-based lending, SBA/USDA, and other commercial finance portfolios. When excluding commercial insurance premium finance loans,\ncommercial finance loans at September 30, 2024 increased $372.5 million, or 13%, compared to September 30, 2023.\nTotal end-of-period deposits decreased 11% to $5.88 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $6.59 billion at September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease in end-of-period deposits was primarily driven by decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits of $715.8 million, money market deposits\nof $10.6 million, and savings deposits of $10.3 million, partially offset by an increase in wholesale deposits of $20.1 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $433.3 million in deposits related to government stimulus programs. Of the total amount of\ngovernment stimulus program deposits, $198.2 million are on activated cards while $235.1 million are on inactivated cards.\nThe Company's total borrowings increased $363.5 million to $410.4 million at September 30, 2024 from $46.9 million at September 30, 2023,\nprimarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings of $364.0 million. See Note 10. Short-term and Long-term Borrowings to the “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements,” which are included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n62\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company’s stockholders’ equity totaled $839.6 million, an increase of $189.0 million, from $650.6 million at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss and increases in additional\npaid-in capital and retained earnings. The Company and Bank remained above the federal regulatory minimum capital requirements at\nSeptember 30, 2024, and continued to be classified as well-capitalized, and in good standing with the regulatory agencies. See Note 14. Capital\nRequirements and Restrictions on Retained Earnings to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which is included in Part II, Item 8\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNoninterest-bearing Checking Deposits. The Company may hold negative balances associated with cardholder programs in the Partner\nSolutions business line that are included within noninterest-bearing deposits on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nNegative balances can relate to any of the following payments functions:\n– Prefundings: The Company deploys funds to cards prior to receiving cash (typically 2-3 days) where the prefunding balance is netted at\na pooled partner level utilizing ASC 210-20.\n– Discount fundings: The Company funds cards in alignment to expected breakage values on the card. Consumers may spend more than\nis estimated. These discounts are netted at a pooled partner level using ASC 210-20. The majority of these discount fundings relate to a\nsmall number of partners and are analyzed on an ongoing basis.\n– Demand Deposit Account (\"DDA\") overdrafts: Certain programs offered allow cardholders traditional DDA overdraft protection services\nwhereby cardholders can spend a limited amount in excess of their available card balance. When overdrawn, these accounts are re-\nclassed as loans on the balance sheet within the Consumer Finance category.\nThe Company meets the Right of Set off criteria in ASC 210-20, Balance Sheet - Offsetting, for all payments negative deposit balances with the\nexception of DDA overdrafts. The following table summarizes the Company's negative deposit balances within the Partner Solutions business\nline:\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNoninterest-bearing deposits $ 5,982,992 $ 6,608,137\nPrefunding (315,994) (230,749)\nDiscount funding (38,665) (34,351)\nDDA overdrafts (11,236) (10,096)\nNoninterest-bearing checking, net $ 5,617,097 $ 6,332,941\nOff-Balance Sheet Custodial Deposits. The Bank utilizes a custodial deposit transference structure for certain prepaid and deposit programs\nwhereby the Bank, acting as custodian of cardholder funds, places a portion of such cardholder funds that are not needed to support near term\nsettlement at one or more third-party banks insured by the FDIC (each, a “Program Bank”). Accounts opened at Program Banks are established\nin the Bank’s name as custodian, for the benefit of the Bank’s cardholders. The Bank remains the issuer of all cards and holder of all accounts\nunder the applicable cardholder agreements and has sole custodial control and transaction authority over the accounts opened at Program\nBanks.\nThe Bank maintains the records of each cardholder’s deposits maintained at Program Banks. Program Banks undergo robust due diligence prior\nto becoming a Program Bank and are also subject to continuous monitoring.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company managed $201.9 million of customer deposits at other banks in its capacity as custodian. These\ndeposits provide the Company with the ability to earn servicing fee income, typically reflective of the EFFR. Servicing fee income totaled $27.2\nmillion during fiscal 2024, compared to $53.4 million for fiscal 2023.\n63\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company’s results of operations are dependent on net interest income, provision for credit loss, noninterest income, noninterest expense\nand income tax expense. Net interest income is the difference, or spread, between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average\nrate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate spread is affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors that influence interest\nrates, loan and lease demand and deposit flows. Notwithstanding that a significant amount of the Company’s deposits, primarily those\nattributable to the Partner Solutions business line, pay relatively low rates of interest or none at all, the Company, like other financial institutions,\nis subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest-earning assets mature or reprice at different times, or on a different basis, than its\ninterest-bearing liabilities and that card processing expense derived from contractual agreements with certain Partner Solutions partners are tied\nto a rate index and servicing fees the Company recognizes for off-balance sheet custodial deposits are typically reflective of the EFFR. The\nprovision for credit loss is the adjustment to the allowance for credit losses balance for the applicable period. The allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred by the loan and lease portfolio over the life of each financial\nasset as of the balance sheet date.\nThe Company’s noninterest income is derived primarily from tax product fees, card and deposit fees, credit products, and ATM fees attributable\nto the Partner Solutions business line and fees charged on bank loans, leases and transaction accounts. Noninterest income is also derived from\nrental income, net gains on the sale of securities, net gains on the sale of loans and leases, as well as the Company’s holdings of bank-owned\nlife insurance. This income is offset by noninterest expenses, such as compensation and benefits associated with personnel, as well as card\nprocessing expenses and tax product expenses attributable to the Partner Solutions business line. Noninterest expense is also impacted by\noperating lease equipment depreciation expense, occupancy and equipment expense, legal and consulting expenses, and regulatory expense.\nAverage Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the\nresulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates. The balances\npresented in the table below are calculated on a daily average basis. Tax-equivalent adjustments have been made in yields on interest-bearing\nassets and NIM. Nonaccruing loans and leases have been included in the table as loans or leases carrying a zero yield.\n64\nTable of Contents\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAverage Interest Average Interest Average Interest\nOutstanding Earned / Yield / Outstanding Earned / Yield / Outstanding Earned / Yield /\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Paid Rate (1) Balance Paid Rate (1) Balance Paid Rate (1)\nInterest-earning assets:\nCash and fed funds sold $ 348,149 $ 15,446 4.44 % $ 316,222 $ 12,425 3.93 % $ 496,334 $ 3,535 0.71 %\nMortgage-backed securities 1,450,601 39,402 2.72 % 1,541,909 41,197 2.67 % 1,292,804 26,846 2.08 %\nTax-exempt investment securities 130,567 3,631 3.52 % 147,863 3,924 3.36 % 183,936 3,565 2.45 %\nAsset-backed securities 227,099 13,048 5.75 % 186,854 8,197 4.39 % 283,752 3,898 1.37 %\nOther investment securities 285,281 8,948 3.14 % 295,439 9,390 3.18 % 268,062 6,274 2.34 %\nTotal investments 2,093,548 65,029 3.15 % 2,172,065 62,708 2.94 % 2,028,554 40,583 2.05 %\nCommercial finance 3,770,214 311,480 8.26 % 3,220,585 261,195 8.11 % 2,884,585 203,004 7.04 %\nConsumer finance 318,886 33,008 10.35 % 231,242 22,404 9.69 % 295,356 23,097 7.82 %\nTax services 153,713 9,194 5.98 % 141,210 10,490 7.43 % 179,611 12,978 7.23 %\nWarehouse finance 416,988 42,194 10.12 % 343,168 29,513 8.60 % 433,121 27,474 6.34 %\nCommunity banking — — — % — — — % 34,758 1,525 4.39 %\nTotal loans and leases(3) 4,659,801 395,876 8.50 % 3,936,205 323,602 8.22 % 3,827,431 268,078 7.00 %\nTotal interest-earning assets 7,101,498 $ 476,351 6.72 % 6,424,492 $ 398,735 6.23 % 6,352,319 $ 312,196 4.93 %\nNoninterest-earning assets 560,259 585,719 751,555\nTotal assets $ 7,661,757 $ 7,010,211 $ 7,103,874\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nInterest-bearing checking $ 506 $ 1 0.22 % $ 355 $ 1 0.30 % $ 338 $ 1 0.32 %\nSavings 54,594 17 0.03 % 65,175 25 0.04 % 78,613 24 0.03 %\nMoney markets 181,515 2,318 1.28 % 137,024 461 0.34 % 96,112 214 0.22 %\nTime deposits 4,754 13 0.28 % 6,488 10 0.15 % 8,493 38 0.45 %\nWholesale deposits 191,276 10,670 1.18 % 81,153 3,859 4.75 % 63,529 223 0.35 %\nTotal interest-bearing deposits (a) 432,645 13,019 3.01 % 290,195 4,356 1.50 % 247,085 500 0.20 %\nOvernight fed funds purchased 99,290 5,538 5.58 % 74,812 3,922 5.24 % 32,414 235 0.73 %\nSubordinated debentures 19,638 1,421 7.23 % 19,560 1,422 7.27 % 46,441 3,375 7.27 %\nOther borrowings 13,862 1,255 9.06 % 15,108 1,174 7.77 % 17,490 762 4.36 %\nTotal borrowings 132,790 8,214 6.19 % 109,480 6,518 5.95 % 96,345 4,372 4.54 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 565,435 21,233 3.76 % 399,675 10,874 2.72 % 343,430 4,872 1.42 %\nNoninterest-bearing deposits (b) 6,113,217 — — % 5,739,084 — — % 5,776,852 — — %\nTotal deposits and interest-bearing liabilities 6,678,652 $ 21,233 0.32 % 6,138,759 $ 10,874 0.18 % 6,120,282 $ 4,872 0.08 %\nOther noninterest-bearing liabilities 251,475 200,054 202,887\nTotal liabilities 6,930,127 6,338,813 6,323,169\nShareholders' equity 731,630 671,398 780,705\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 7,661,757 $ 7,010,211 $ 7,103,874\nNet interest income and net interest rate spread\nincluding noninterest-bearing deposits $ 455,118 6.40 % $ 387,861 6.05 % $ 307,324 4.85 %\nNet interest margin 6.41 % 6.04 % 4.84 %\nTax-equivalent effect 0.01 % 0.01 % 0.01 %\nNet interest margin, tax equivalent (2) 6.42 % 6.05 % 4.85 %\nTotal cost of deposits (a+b) 6,545,862 13,019 0.20 % 6,029,279 4,356 0.07 % 6,023,937 500 0.01 %\n(1) Tax rate used to arrive at the tax-equivalent yield (\"TEY\") for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was 21%.\n(2) Net interest margin expressed on a fully taxable equivalent basis (\"net interest margin, tax equivalent\") is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Management of the Company believes that it is a\nstandard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin expressed on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and accordingly believe the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure may be\nuseful for peer comparison purposes.\n(3) Included in the yield computation are net loan fees of $22.7 million, $27.7 million, and $33.7 million, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n65\nTable of Contents\nRate / Volume Analysis\nThe following table presents, for the periods presented, the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major\ncomponents of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The table distinguishes between the change related to higher outstanding\nbalances and the change due to the levels and volatility of interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate); and (ii)\nchanges in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). Due to the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period,\nit is not possible to precisely allocate such changes between volume and rate. For this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume that\ncannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 vs. 2023 2023 vs. 2022\nIncrease / Increase / Total Increase / Increase / Total\n(Decrease) (Decrease) Increase / (Decrease) (Decrease) Increase /\n(Dollars in thousands) Due to Volume Due to Rate (Decrease) Due to Volume Due to Rate (Decrease)\nInterest-earning assets:\nCash and fed funds sold $ 1,320 $ 1,701 $ 3,021 $ (1,709)$ 10,599 $ 8,890\nMortgage-backed securities (2,515) 720 (1,795) 5,795 8,556 14,351\nTax-exempt investment securities (546) 253 (293) (1,032) 1,391 359\nAsset-backed securities 1,986 2,865 4,851 (1,721) 6,020 4,299\nOther investment securities (327) (115) (442) 691 2,425 3,116\nTotal investments (2,319) 4,640 2,321 3,115 19,010 22,125\nCommercial finance 45,374 4,911 50,285 25,245 32,946 58,191\nConsumer finance 8,985 1,619 10,604 (5,584) 4,891 (693)\nTax services 873 (2,169) (1,296) (2,837) 349 (2,488)\nWarehouse finance 6,961 5,720 12,681 (6,457) 8,496 2,039\nCommunity banking — — — (763) (762) (1,525)\nTotal loans and leases 61,017 11,257 72,274 7,778 47,746 55,524\nTotal interest-earning assets $ 60,018 $ 17,598 $ 77,616 $ 9,184 $ 77,355 $ 86,539\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nSavings $ (3)$ (5)$ (8) $ 1 $ — $ 1\nMoney markets 196 1,661 1,857 247 — 247\nTime deposits (4) 7 3 (28) — (28)\nWholesale deposits 8,112 (1,301) 6,811 78 3,558 3,636\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 2,842 5,821 8,663 101 3,755 3,856\nOvernight fed funds purchased 1,350 266 1,616 644 3,043 3,687\nSubordinated debentures 6 (7) (1) (1,952) (1) (1,953)\nOther borrowings (102) 183 81 (116) 528 412\nTotal borrowings 1,429 267 1,696 653 1,493 2,146\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities $ 4,271 $ 6,088 $ 10,359 $ 754 $ 5,248 $ 6,002\nNet effect on net interest income $ 55,747 $ 11,510 $ 67,257 $ 8,430 $ 72,107 $ 80,537\nComparison of Operating Results for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023\nThe Company reported net income of $168.4 million, or $6.62 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$163.6 million, or $5.99 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $4.7 million. The increase in net income\nwas driven by an increase in net interest income and a decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest\nincome and increases in noninterest expense and income tax expense. Total revenue for fiscal 2024 was $754.7 million, compared to $704.5\nmillion for fiscal 2023, an increase of 7%.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for fiscal 2024 was $455.1 million, an increase of 17%, from $387.9 million for the same period of the prior year. The\nincrease was mainly attributable to increased yields, higher average interest-earning asset balances and an improved earning asset mix.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe Company's average interest-earning assets for fiscal 2024 increased by $677.0 million to $7.10 billion compared with fiscal 2023, primarily\ndue to growth in average outstanding balances of loans and leases and cash balances, partially offset by a decrease in total investment security\nbalances. The Company's average outstanding balance of loans and leases increased $723.6 million compared to the prior fiscal year due to\nincreases across all loan portfolios.\nThe Company’s average deposits and interest-bearing liabilities increased $539.9 million to $6.68 billion during fiscal 2024 from $6.14 billion\nduring fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in average noninterest-bearing deposits of $374.2 million, interest-bearing\ndeposits of $142.5 million, and total borrowings of $23.3 million.\nFiscal 2024 NIM increased to 6.41% from 6.04% in fiscal 2023. The overall reported TEY on average earning asset yields increased 37 basis\npoints to 6.42% compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by an improved earning asset mix. The yield on the loan and lease portfolio\nwas 8.50% compared to 8.22% for the prior fiscal year and the TEY on the securities portfolio was 3.15% compared to 2.94% for the prior fiscal\nyear.\nThe Company’s cost of funds for all deposits and borrowings averaged 0.32% during fiscal 2024, as compared to 0.18% during fiscal 2023. The\nCompany's overall cost of deposits was 0.20% in fiscal 2024, as compared to 0.07% during fiscal 2023.\nProvision for Credit Loss\nThe Company recognized a provision for credit loss of $42.7 million for fiscal 2024, compared to $57.4 million in fiscal 2023. The period-over-\nperiod decrease in provision for credit loss was primarily due to decreases in the tax services portfolio of $12.8 million and the commercial\nfinance portfolio of $3.3 million, partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million in provision for credit loss in the consumer finance portfolio. The\ndecrease in provision for credit loss in the commercial finance portfolio was primarily due to the commercial insurance premium finance portfolio\nmoving to held for sale and reversing out the provision for credit loss on that portfolio. The Company recognized net charge-offs of $46.6 million\nfor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $53.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Net\ncharge-offs attributable to the tax services, commercial finance, and consumer finance portfolios for fiscal 2024 were $23.0 million, $19.5 million,\nand $4.1 million, respectively. Net charge-offs attributable to the tax services, commercial finance, and consumer finance portfolios for fiscal\n2023 were $35.8 million, $15.6 million, and $2.3 million, respectively. See Note 3. Loans and Leases, Net for further information on the provision\nfor credit loss.\nNoninterest Income\nFiscal 2024 noninterest income decreased 5% to $299.6 million, compared to $316.6 million for fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily driven\nby a decrease in card and deposit fees and the gain on sale of trademarks recognized in the prior year, partially offset by increases in gain on\nsale of other and tax services product fees.\nThe decrease in card and deposit fee income was primarily related to lower servicing fee income due to a reduction in custodial deposits.\nServicing fee income totaled $27.2 million during fiscal 2024, compared to $53.4 million for fiscal 2023.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased 10% to $513.3 million for fiscal 2024 from $465.0 million for fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily attributable\nto increases in card processing expense, compensation and benefits expense, and other expense, partially offset by decreases in operating\nlease equipment depreciation and legal and consulting expense.\nThe card processing expense increase was due to rate-related agreements with Partner Solutions relationships. The amount of expense paid\nunder those agreements is based on an agreed upon rate index that varies depending on the deposit levels, floor rates, market conditions, and\nother performance conditions. Generally this rate index is based on a percentage of the EFFR and reprices immediately upon a change in the\nEFFR. Approximately 57% of the deposit portfolio was subject to these higher rate-related processing expenses. For fiscal 2024, contractual,\nrate-related processing expenses were $110.8 million, as compared to $77.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n67\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of $29.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 14.7%, for fiscal 2024, compared to an\nincome tax expense of $16.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 9.0%, for fiscal 2023. The increase in income tax expense was\nprimarily due a decrease in investment tax credits.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company originated $68.4 million in renewable energy leases, compared to $93.6 million for\nthe prior fiscal year. Investment tax credits related to renewable energy leases are recognized ratably based on income throughout each fiscal\nyear.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2022\nA comparison of the 2023 results to the 2022 results and other 2022 information not included herein can be found in the Company's Annual\nReport on Form 10-K: Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” filed\nNovember 21, 2023 and is incorporated by reference herein.\nAsset Quality\nGenerally, when a loan or lease becomes delinquent 90 days or more or when the collection of principal or interest becomes doubtful, the\nCompany will place the loan or lease on a nonaccrual status and, as a result, previously accrued interest income on the loan or lease is reversed\nagainst current income. The loan or lease will generally remain on a non-accrual status until six months of good payment history has been\nestablished or management believes the financial status of the borrower has been significantly restored. Certain relationships in the table below\nare over 90 days past due and still accruing. The Company considers these relationships as being in the process of collection. Insurance\npremium finance loans, consumer finance and tax services loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status, but are instead written off when\nthe collection of principal and interest become doubtful.\nLoans and leases, or portions thereof, are generally charged-off when collection of principal becomes doubtful. Typically, this is associated with a\ndelay or shortfall in payments of 210 days or more for commercial insurance premium finance, 120 days or more for consumer credit products\nand leases, and 90 days or more for commercial finance loans. Action is taken to charge off ERO loans if such loans have not been collected by\nthe end of June and refund advance loans if such loans have not been collected by the end of the calendar year. The Company individually\nevaluates loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, which generally means loans and leases\nidentified as modifications or loans and leases on nonaccrual status.\nThe Company believes that the level of allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 was appropriate and reflected probable losses related\nto these loans and leases; however, there can be no assurance that all loans and leases will be fully collectible or that the present level of the\nallowance will be adequate in the future. See the section below titled “Allowance for Credit Losses” for further information.\n68\nTable of Contents\nThe table below sets forth the amounts and categories of the Company's nonperforming assets.\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNonperforming Loans and Leases\nNonaccruing loans and leases:\nCommercial finance $ 26,412 $ 37,372\nTotal nonaccruing loans and leases 26,412 37,372\nAccruing loans and leases delinquent 90 days or more:\nLoans held for sale 1,050 306\nCommercial finance 2,314 11,242\nConsumer finance 3,053 2,210\nTax services(1) 8,733 5,082\nTotal accruing loans and leases delinquent 90 days or more 15,150 18,840\nTotal nonperforming loans and leases 41,562 56,212\nOther Assets\nNonperforming operating leases 1,471 1,764\nTotal other assets 1,471 1,764\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 43,033 $ 57,976\nTotal as a percentage of total assets 0.57 % 0.77 %\n(1) Certain tax services loans do not bear interest.\nThe Company's nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 were $43.0 million, representing 0.57% of total assets, compared to $58.0\nmillion, or 0.77% of total assets at September 30, 2023. The decrease in the nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets at\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily driven by a decrease in nonperforming loans in the commercial finance\nportfolio, partially offset by increases in the tax services and consumer finance portfolios.\nThe Company's nonperforming loans and leases at September 30, 2024, were $41.6 million, representing 0.87% of total gross loans and leases,\ncompared to $56.2 million, or 1.26% of total gross loans and leases at September 30, 2023.\nClassified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of certain loans, leases, and other assets such as debt and equity securities\nconsidered by the Bank's primary regulator, the OCC, to be of lesser quality as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss,” with each such classification\ndependent on the facts and circumstances surrounding the assets in question. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately\nprotected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those\ncharacterized by the “distinct possibility” that the Bank will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful”\nhave all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make\n“collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets\nclassified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such minimal value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a\nspecific loss reserve is not warranted.\nGeneral allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but\nwhich, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When assets are classified as “loss,” the Bank is\nrequired either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such\namount. The Bank’s determinations as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances are subject to review by its\nregulatory authorities, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.\nOn the basis of management’s review of its loans, leases, and other assets, at September 30, 2024, the Company had classified loans and\nleases of $180.9 million as substandard, $10.3 million as doubtful and none as loss. At September 30, 2023, the Company classified loans and\nleases of $208.2 million as substandard, $8.2 million as doubtful and none as loss.\n69\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses. The ACL represents management’s estimate of current credit losses expected to be incurred by the loan and lease\nportfolio over the life of each financial asset as of the balance sheet date. The Company individually evaluates loans and leases that do not\nshare similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, which generally means loans and leases identified as modifications or loans and\nleases on nonaccrual status. All other loans and leases are evaluated collectively for credit loss. A reserve for unfunded credit commitments such\nas letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments is recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nIndividually evaluated loans and leases are a key component of the ACL. Generally, the Company measures credit loss on individually evaluated\nloans based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, as the Company considers these financial assets to be collateral\ndependent. If an individually evaluated loan or lease is not collateral dependent, credit loss is measured at the present value of expected future\ncash flows discounted at the loan or lease initial effective interest rate.\nThe Company's ACL totaled $45.3 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease compared to $49.7 million at September 30, 2023. The $4.4\nmillion year-over-year decrease in the ACL was primarily driven by a $4.4 million decrease in the allowance related to the commercial finance\nportfolio and a $0.1 million decrease in the allowance related to the consumer finance portfolio, partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in the\nallowance related to the warehouse finance portfolio.\nThe following table presents the Company's ACL as a percentage of its total loans and leases.\nAs of the Period Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nCommercial finance 1.29 % 1.17 % 1.21 % 1.30 % 1.26 %\nConsumer finance 0.90 % 2.23 % 1.71 % 1.45 % 0.92 %\nTax services 0.02 % 66.35 % 37.31 % 1.52 % 0.04 %\nWarehouse finance 0.10 % 0.10 % 0.10 % 0.10 % 0.10 %\nTotal loans and leases 1.11 % 1.73 % 1.83 % 1.22 % 1.14 %\nTotal loans and leases excluding tax services 1.12 % 1.12 % 1.14 % 1.21 % 1.14 %\nThe Company's ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.11% at September 30, 2024 from 1.14% at September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in the total loans and leases coverage ratio was primarily driven by the tax services and consumer finance portfolios, partially\noffset by an increase in the commercial finance portfolio.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The financial information contained within these financial\nstatements is, to a significant extent, based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already\noccurred. Management has identified its critical accounting policies, which are those policies described below as Critical Accounting Estimates\nthat, in management's view, are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies involve\ncomplex and subjective decisions and assessments. Some of these estimates may be uncertain at the time they are made, could change from\nperiod to period, and could have a material impact on the financial statements. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note\n4. Loans and Leases, Net to the \"Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements,\" which is included in Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information.\n70\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses methodology estimates expected credit losses over the life of each financial asset as of the balance\nsheet date.\nFor the loan and lease portfolio, the Company measures credit loss on individually evaluated loans based on the fair value of the collateral less\nestimated selling costs if collateral dependent or based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan or lease initial\neffective interest rate if not collateral dependent. The majority of the Company's loans and leases subject to individual evaluation are considered\ncollateral dependent. Only loans and leases that are on nonaccrual status or are designated as a modification are subject to individual\nevaluation. Management has also identified certain structured finance credits for alternative energy projects in which a substantial cash collateral\naccount has been established to mitigate credit risk. Due to the nature of the transactions and significant cash collateral positions, these credits\nare evaluated individually. All other loans and leases are evaluated collectively for credit loss by pooling loans and leases based on similar risk\ncharacteristics. The collective evaluation of expected losses in all commercial finance portfolios is based on a cohort loss rate and adjustments\nfor forward-looking information, including industry and macroeconomic forecasts. The cohort loss rate is a life of loan loss rate that immediately\nreverts to historical loss information for the remaining maturity of the financial asset. Management has elected to use a twelve to twenty-four\nmonth reasonable and supportable forecast for forward-looking information. Factors utilized in the determination of the allowance include\nhistorical loss experience, current and forecasted economic conditions, and measurement date credit characteristics such as product type,\ndelinquency, and industry. The unfunded credit commitments depend on these same factors, as well as estimates of lines of credit usage. The\ncollective evaluation of expected credit losses for certain consumer lending portfolios utilizes different methodologies when estimating expected\ncredit losses.\nDebt securities HTM include implicit and explicit guarantees by government agencies and have an expected zero risk of loss, therefore no\nprovision for credit loss for debt securities held to maturity has been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. Debt\nsecurities AFS are recorded at fair value and are assessed quarterly for credit loss. Any such credit loss is recorded in the Company’s Provision\nfor Credit Loss on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. Non-credit related losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive\nIncome in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Condition.\nAlthough management believes the levels of the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are adequate to\nabsorb expected credit losses in the financial assets evaluated, a decline in local economic conditions or other factors could result in increasing\nlosses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business\nCombinations. Under the acquisition method, the Company records assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed,\nand any non-controlling interest in the acquired business at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Any acquisition-related transaction costs\nare expensed in the period incurred. Results of operations of the acquired entity are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from\nthe date of acquisition. Any measurement-period adjustments are recorded in the period the adjustment is identified.\nThe excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets\nacquired, including identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest often requires the use of significant\nestimates and assumptions. This may involve estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on\ndiscounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques such as estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth rates, discount rates, multiples\nof earnings or other relevant factors. In addition, the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is\nsubjective. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n71\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company’s primary sources of funds are deposits, derived principally through its Partner Solutions business line, borrowings, principal and\ninterest payments on loans and leases and mortgage-backed securities, and maturing investment securities. In addition, the Company utilizes\nwholesale deposit sources to provide temporary funding when necessary or when favorable terms are available. While scheduled loan\nrepayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows and early loan repayments are influenced by the level of interest\nrates, general economic conditions and competition. The Company uses its capital resources principally to meet ongoing commitments to fund\nmaturing certificates of deposit and loan commitments, to maintain liquidity, and to meet operating expenses. See Note 20. Subsequent Events\nto the \"Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements,\" which is included in Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on the closing of the sale of the commercial insurance premium finance business.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had unfunded loan and lease commitments of $1.29 billion. Management believes that loan repayment\nand other sources of funds will be adequate to meet the Company’s foreseeable short- and long-term liquidity needs. The liquidity sources as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 include $158.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $201.9 million in off-balance sheet custodial deposits. When\nfactoring in all resources, such as the FHLB, the FRB Discount Window and other unsecured funding and wholesale options, the Company has\nover $2.1 billion in available liquidity. Due to the characteristics of the Company's deposit portfolio, uninsured deposits remained less than 15%\nof total deposits during fiscal year 2024 and below the Company's available liquidity.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual obligations at September 30, 2024.\n(Dollars in thousands) Less Than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More Than 5 Years Total\nTime deposits $ 3,104 $ 1,102 $ — $ — $ 4,206\nWholesale time deposits — 25,000 — — 25,000\nShort-term debt 377,000 — — — 377,000\nLong-term debt — — — 33,354 33,354\nOperating leases 3,985 6,587 5,936 12,703 29,211\nTotal $ 384,089 $ 32,689 $ 5,936 $ 46,057 $ 468,771\nFor more information on the Company’s short-term and long-term borrowings, see “Funding Activities – Borrowings” within Item 1 “Business,”\nwhich is included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 10. Short-term and Long-term Borrowings to the “Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements,” which is included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.”\nThe Company and the Bank met regulatory requirements for classification as well-capitalized institutions at September 30, 2024. Based on\ncurrent and expected continued profitability and subject to continued access to capital markets, management believes that the Company and the\nBank will continue to meet the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% in addition to required minimum capital ratios. See Note 14. Capital\nRequirements and Restrictions on Retained Earnings to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which is included in Part II, Item 8\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe payment of dividends and repurchase of shares have the effect of reducing stockholders’ equity. Prior to authorizing such transactions, the\nBoard of Directors considers the effect the dividend or repurchase of shares would have on liquidity and regulatory capital ratios. See\n\"Regulation and Supervision - Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions\" within Item 1 \"Business\", which is included in Part I of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNo assurance can be given that our regulators will consider our liquidity level, or our capital level, though substantially in excess of current rules\npursuant to which the Company and the Bank are considered “well-capitalized,” to be sufficiently high in the future. See Note 14.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company derives a portion of its income from the excess of interest collected over interest paid. The rates of interest the Company earns on\nassets and pays on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Accordingly, the\nCompany’s results of operations, like those of most financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate\nsensitivity of its assets and liabilities.\nThe Company monitors and measures its exposure to changes in interest rates in order to comply with applicable government regulations and\nrisk policies established by the Board of Directors, and in order to preserve stockholder value. In monitoring interest rate risk, the Company\nanalyzes assets and liabilities based on characteristics including size, coupon rate, repricing frequency, maturity date, likelihood of prepayment,\nand deposit behaviors.\nThe Company’s primary objective for its investment portfolio is to provide a source of liquidity for the Company. In addition, the investment\nportfolio may be used in the management of the Company’s interest rate risk profile. The investment policy generally calls for funds to be\ninvested among various categories of security types and maturities based upon the Company’s need for liquidity, desire to achieve a proper\nbalance between minimizing risk while maximizing yield, the need to provide collateral for borrowings, and the need to fulfill the Company’s\nasset/liability management goals.\nThe Company believes that its portfolio of longer duration deposits generated from its Partner Solutions business line provides a stable and\nprofitable funding vehicle. A portion of the Company’s deposit balances are subject to variable card processing expenses, derived from\ncontractual agreements with certain Partner Solutions partners tied to a rate index, typically the EFFR. These costs reprice immediately upon a\nchange in the applicable rate index.\nThe Bank, acting as custodian of cardholder funds, places a portion of such cardholder funds at one or more third-party banks insured by the\nFDIC (each, a “Program Bank”). These custodial deposits earn recordkeeping service fee income, typically reflective of the EFFR.\nThe Board of Directors and relevant government regulations establish limits on the level of acceptable interest rate risk at the Company, to which\nmanagement adheres. There can be no assurance, however, that, in the event of an adverse change in interest rates, the Company’s efforts to\nlimit interest rate risk will be successful.\nInterest Rate Risk (“IRR”)\nOverview. The Company actively manages interest rate risk, as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported\nearnings. The Company's IRR analysis is designed to compare income and economic valuation simulations in market scenarios designed to\nalter the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes, as well as the slope of the yield curve. This analysis may not represent all\nimpacts driven by changes in the interest rate environment, such as certain other card fee income and expense line items tied to card processing\nexpense derived from contractual agreements with certain Partner Solutions partners and servicing fees the Company recognizes from custodial\noff-balance sheet deposits. The Company does not currently engage in trading activities to control IRR although it may do so in the future, if\ndeemed necessary, to help manage IRR.\nEarnings at risk and economic value analysis. As a continuing part of its financial strategy, the Bank considers methods of managing an\nasset/liability mismatch consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of net interest income. In order to monitor IRR, the Company has created\nan Asset/Liability Committee whose principal responsibilities are to assess the Bank’s asset/liability mix and implement strategies that will\nenhance income while managing the Bank’s vulnerability to changes in interest rates.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe Company uses two approaches to model IRR: Earnings at Risk (“EAR analysis”) and Economic Value of Equity (“EVE analysis”). Under\nEAR analysis, net interest income is calculated for each interest rate scenario and compared to the net interest income forecast in the base case\nover a one-year minimum time horizon. The results are affected by projected rates, prepayments, caps and floors. Management exercises its\nbest judgment in making assumptions regarding events that management can influence, such as non-contractual deposit re-pricing, as well as\nevents outside of management's control, such as customer behavior on loan and deposit activity and the effect that competition has on both\nlending and deposit pricing. These assumptions are subjective and, as a result, net interest income simulation results will differ from actual\nresults due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, changes in market conditions, customer behavior and management\nstrategies, among other factors. The Company performs various sensitivity analyses on assumptions of deposit attrition, loan prepayments, and\nasset re-pricing, as well as market-implied forward rates and various likely and extreme interest rate scenarios, including rapid and gradual\ninterest rate ramps, rate shocks and yield curve twists.\nThe EAR analysis used in the following table reflects the required analysis used no less than quarterly by management. It models basis point\nparallel shifts in market interest rates over the next one-year period. The following table shows the results of the scenarios as of September 30,\n2024 and 2023:\nNet Sensitive Earnings at Risk\nChange in Interest Income/Expense\nfor a given change in interest rates\nOver/(Under) Base Case Parallel Shift\n(Dollars in thousands) Book Value -200 -100 Base +100 +200\nBalances as of September 30, 2024\nTotal interest income 6,676,417 411,926 440,588 470,620 499,529 527,533\nTotal interest expense 634,988 12,614 16,686 22,053 27,715 33,184\nNet interest income 399,312 423,902 448,567 471,814 494,349\nPercentage change from base -11.0 % -5.5 % — % 5.2 % 10.2 %\nBalances as of September 30, 2023\nTotal interest income 6,650,735 397,360 424,061 450,823 477,078 503,412\nTotal interest expense 269,861 1,069 1,905 3,530 5,429 7,352\nNet interest income 396,291 422,156 447,293 471,649 496,060\nPercentage change from base -11.4 % -5.6 % — % 5.4 % 10.9 %\nThe EAR analysis reported at September 30, 2024, shows that total interest income will change more rapidly than total interest expense over the\nnext year. IRR is a snapshot in time. The Company’s business and deposits are predictably cyclical on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis. The\nCompany’s static IRR results could vary depending on which day of the week the month ends, primarily related to payroll processing and timing\nof when certain programs are prefunded and when the funds are received.\nUnder EVE analysis, the economic value of financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments is derived under each rate scenario.\nThe economic value of equity is calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities, net of the impact of off-\nbalance sheet instruments.\n74\nTable of Contents\nThe EVE analysis used in the following table reflects the required analysis used no less than quarterly by management. It models immediate\nbasis point parallel shifts in market interest rates. The following table shows the results of the scenario as of September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nEconomic Value Sensitivity\nStandard (Parallel Shift)\nEconomic Value of Equity at Risk %\n-200 -100 +100 +200\nBalances as of September 30, 2024\nPercentage change from base -10.0 % -3.9 % 2.6 % 4.2 %\nBalances as of September 30, 2023\nPercentage change from base -9.9 % -4.3 % 3.4 % 6.3 %\nThe EVE at risk reported at September 30, 2024 shows that the economic value of equity position is expected to benefit from rising interest rates\ndue to the large amount of noninterest-bearing funding.\n75\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,\n2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated November\n26, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial\nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does\nnot alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses (ACL) – Qualitative Adjustments\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes expected credit losses over the contractual lives of financial\nassets carried at amortized cost, including loans receivable, utilizing the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) methodology. Estimates of\nexpected credit losses are based on relevant information about current conditions, past events, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking\nforecasts regarding collectability of the reported amounts. For most of its loan segments, the Company utilized a cohort model which computes\nthe historical life-of-loan loss rate for each identified loan segment (also referred to as the “quantitative loss rates”). The quantitative loss rates\nare then adjusted, as deemed necessary, based on current economic forecasts over a twelve to twenty-four month reasonable and supportable\nforecast period as well as for measurement date credit characteristics including problem loan and delinquency trends, portfolio growth and other\nfactors (also referred to as the “qualitative adjustments”).\n77\nTable of Contents\nWe have identified auditing the qualitative adjustments as a critical audit matter as management’s determination of the qualitative adjustments\nused in the ACL is subjective and involves significant management judgments; and our audit procedures related to the qualitative adjustments\ninvolved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant audit effort, including the need to involve more experienced audit personnel.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Testing the effectiveness of controls over the qualitative adjustments used in the ACL calculation including controls addressing:\n◦ Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls pertaining to the key assumptions and judgments applied in the\ndevelopment of the qualitative adjustments.\n◦ Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the controls around the mathematical accuracy of the qualitative adjustments\napplied to the loan segments in the ACL calculation.\n• Substantively testing management’s determination of the qualitative adjustments used in the ACL estimate, including evaluating their\njudgements and assumptions, including:\n◦ Testing management’s process for developing the qualitative adjustments and assessing the reasonableness, relevance and\nreliability of data used to develop the adjustments, including evaluating their judgments and assumptions for reasonableness.\nAmong other procedures, our evaluation considered evidence from internal and external sources, loan portfolio performance\nand whether such assumptions were applied consistently from period to period.\n◦ Analytically evaluating the qualitative adjustments for directional consistency.\n◦ Testing the qualitative adjustments for reasonableness, including evaluating significant changes.\n◦ Testing the mathematical accuracy of the qualitative adjustments applied to the loan segments in the ACL calculation.\n/s/ Crowe LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSouth Bend, Indiana\nNovember 26, 2024\n78\nTable of Contents\nPATHWARD FINANCIAL, INC.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pathward Financial, Inc. (\"Pathward Financial\" or the “Company” or \"us\"), a\nregistered bank holding company located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company's subsidiaries include\nPathward®, National Association (\"Pathward®, N.A.\" or \"Pathward\" or the “Bank”), a national bank whose primary federal regulator is the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency (the \"OCC\"), and Pathward Venture Capital, LLC, a wholly-owned service corporation subsidiary of Pathward,\nN.A. which invests in companies in the financial services industry. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe Company also owns 100% of First Midwest Financial Capital Trust I (the “Trust”), which was formed in July 2001 for the purpose of issuing\ntrust preferred securities, and Crestmark Capital Trust I, which was acquired from the Crestmark Acquisition in August 2018. The Trust and\nCrestmark Capital Trust I are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.\nIn addition, the Company is a variable interest holder in certain entities in which the equity holders do not have the characteristics of a controlling\nfinancial interest or where the entity does not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support\n(referred to as variable interest entities or \"VIEs\"). The Company's variable interest arises from contractual ownership or other monetary interests\nthat change with fluctuations in the VIE's net asset value. The primary beneficiary is the entity which has both: (1) the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly impacts the VIE's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of\nthe entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or not a variable interest the Company holds could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of the Company's\ninvolvement with the VIE. Further, the Company assesses whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis.\nIf the determination is made that the Company is the primary beneficiary, then that entity is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNoncontrolling interests represent the portion of net income and equity attributable to third-party owners of consolidated subsidiaries that are not\nwholly-owned by Pathward Financial. All of the Company's noncontrolling interests relate to the Company's Commercial Finance business line.\nVariable Interest Entities\nAs a result of the Crestmark Acquisition, the Company acquired existing membership interests of certain joint venture limited liability companies\n(the \"LLCs\"). The Company holds 80% of the membership interests in each of the LLC entities, which offer commercial lending and other\nfinancing arrangements. In connection with these LLCs, the Company exclusively provides funding for each entity's activities. The Company\ndetermined it is the primary beneficiary of all LLCs as it has the managing power under the terms of each of the LLC operating agreements.\nResults of the LLCs are reflected in the Company's September 30, 2024 Consolidated Financial Statements and are summarized below. The\nassets recognized as a result of consolidating the LLCs are the property of the LLCs and are not available for any other purpose.\n(Dollars in thousands) At September 30, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents $ 127\nLoans and leases 51,835\nAllowance for credit losses (1,148)\nAccrued interest receivable 163\nOther assets 1,110\nTotal assets 52,087\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities 338\nNoncontrolling interest (277)\nNet assets less noncontrolling assets $ 52,026\n85\nTable of Contents\nAmounts for noncontrolling interests reflect the proportionate share of membership interest (equity) and net income attributable to the holders of\nminority membership interest in the following entities:\n• CM Help, LLC - CM Help provides flexible patient loan programs to hospitals and patient customers of hospitals as a financing alternative\nfor the self-pay and co-pay portions of patients’ hospital expenses.\n• CM Southgate II, LLC - CM Southgate II engages in the business of acquiring fleet leases and semi-trailer/tractor loans and leases.\n• CM TFS, LLC - CM TFS engages in the business of acquiring equipment financing term loans and leases.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into off-balance sheet transactions with SPEs, which can be structured as corporations,\ntrusts, limited liability companies, or partnerships and are established for a limited purpose. Currently, the Company utilizes a SPE facility for\ncertain term lending products within the Company's Commercial Finance business line. The Company participated in the structuring of the SPE,\nhas a minority ownership interest in the SPE, and acts as servicer for the SPE in exchange for a servicing fee. Pathward is not the primary\nbeneficiary of the SPE as our risk of loss or right to benefits from the SPE are not significant. At September 30, 2024, there are $18.4 million\ncommercial term loans held at the SPE compared to $13.7 million for the prior fiscal year, and the Company’s equity investment in the SPE is\n$5.8 million compared to $1.2 million for the prior fiscal year. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from the SPE is limited to its equity\ninvestment. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were $4.6 million and no commercial term loans classified as held for sale related to this\nSPE, respectively.\nNATURE OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION\nOne of the Company's primary sources of revenue relates to payment processing services for prepaid cards, ATM sponsorship, tax refund\ntransfer and money movement. Additionally, a significant source of revenue for the Company is interest from the purchase or origination of\ncommercial finance loans, consumer finance loans, and warehouse finance loans. The Company accepts deposits from customers in the normal\ncourse of business on a national basis through its partner solutions and tax services divisions, and through wholesale funding. The Company\noperates in the banking industry, which accounts for the majority of its revenues and assets. The Company uses the “management approach” for\nreporting information about segments in annual and interim financial statements. The management approach is based on the way the chief\noperating decision-maker organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable\nsegments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure and any other manner in which management\ndisaggregates a company. Based on the management approach model, the Company has determined that its business is comprised of three\nreporting segments. See Note 16. Segment Reporting for additional information on the Company's segment reporting.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES IN PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain significant\nestimates include the valuation of residual values within lease receivables, allowance for credit losses, the valuation of goodwill and intangible\nassets and the fair values of securities and other financial instruments. These estimates are reviewed by management regularly; however, they\nare particularly susceptible to significant changes in the future.\n86\nTable of Contents\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents is defined to include the Company’s cash on hand and due from financial\ninstitutions and short-term interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions. The Company reports cash flows net for customer loan\ntransactions, securities purchased under agreement to resell, federal funds purchased, deposit transactions, securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, and FHLB advances with terms less than 90 days. Previously, the FRB required all depository institutions to maintain reserves at\nspecified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking accounts. However, since March 26, 2020, the reserve requirement ratio\nhas been zero percent. At September 30, 2024, the Bank was not required to maintain any reserve balances. The Company at times maintains\nbalances in excess of insured limits at various financial institutions including the FRB, the FHLB and other private institutions. At September 30,\n2024, the Company had $104.9 million in interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB and $1.7 million interest-bearing deposits held at the\nFHLB. The Company does not believe these instruments carry a significant risk of loss but cannot provide assurances that no losses could occur\nif these institutions were to become insolvent.\nSECURITIES\nGAAP requires that, at acquisition, an enterprise classify debt securities into one of three categories: Available for Sale (“AFS”), Held to Maturity\n(“HTM”) or trading. Debt securities AFS are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Unrealized holding gains\nand losses due to risk of credit loss are recognized in earnings while unrealized holding gains and losses due to market conditions and other\nnon-credit risk factors are excluded from earnings and recognized as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) (“AOCI”). See Note 19. Fair Values of Financial Instruments for additional information on fair value of AFS debt securities. Debt\nsecurities HTM are measured at amortized cost. The Company classifies the majority of its debt securities as AFS, which are those the\nCompany may decide to sell if needed for liquidity, asset/liability management, or other reasons. Both AFS and HTM are subject to an allowance\nfor credit losses. Pathward Financial did not hold trading securities at September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nGains and losses on the sale of securities are determined using the specific identification method based on amortized cost and are reflected in\nresults of operations at the time of sale. Interest and dividend income, adjusted by amortization of purchase premium or discount using the level\nyield method, is included in income as earned. For callable debt securities, any purchase premium is amortized to the first call date while any\ndiscount is accreted over the contractual life of the security.\nDebt Securities Credit Losses\nThe Company evaluates debt securities AFS for credit losses on a quarterly basis and records any such losses as a component of provision for\ncredit loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has concluded that any unrealized holding losses in its portfolio as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 are not related to credit loss and as a result has not recorded an allowance for credit losses. See Note 2. Securities for\nfurther information.\nThe Company evaluates debt securities HTM for credit losses on a quarterly basis and records any such losses as a component of provision for\ncredit loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has concluded that its portfolio as of September 30, 2024 has a zero\nrisk of credit loss due to the related U.S. Government financial guarantees underlying the securities within the HTM portfolio and as a result has\nnot recorded an allowance for credit losses.\nEquity Investments\nThe Company holds marketable equity securities, which have readily determinable fair value, and include common equity and mutual funds.\nThese securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, due to changes in fair value, reflected in earnings. Interest and\ndividend income from these securities is recognized in interest income. See Note 2. Securities for additional information on marketable equity\nsecurities.\n87\nTable of Contents\nThe Company also holds non-marketable equity securities that are included in Other Assets in the Company’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Company generally accounts for these investments under the equity method or the provisions of Accounting Standards\nCodification (\"ASC\") 321. Equity Securities. Investments where the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the investee are\naccounted for under the equity method. Investments where the Company cannot exercise significant influence over the investee are measured\nat fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, unless those investments have no readily determinable fair value. Investments\nwithout readily determinable fair value are measured under the measurement alternative, which reflects cost less impairment, with adjustments\nin value resulting from observable price changes arising from orderly transactions of the same or a similar security from the same issuer\n(\"measurement alternative investments\").\nThe Company reviews for impairment for equity method and measurement alternative investments and includes an analysis of the facts and\ncircumstances for each investment, expectations of cash flows, capital needs, and viability of its business model. For equity method, the asset\ncarrying value is reduced when the decline in fair value is considered to be other than temporary. For measurement alternative investments, the\nasset carrying value is reduced when the fair value is less than the carrying value, without the consideration of recovery.\nThe Company held the following non-marketable equity securities:\n• Equity Method - The Company held equity method investments of $4.1 million within other assets as of September 30, 2024 and $4.1\nmillion at September 30, 2023. The Company’s ownership of such investments typically ranges from 5% - 25% of the investee. The\nCompany recognized nominal net earnings from these investments within noninterest income for the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2024. The Company elected to classify distributions received from equity method investments using the cumulative earnings approach\non the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n• Fair Value Method - The Company held equity investments measured at net asset value (\"NAV\") per share (or its equivalent) of $11.8\nmillion at September 30, 2024 and $8.4 million at September 30, 2023 where NAV is considered the fair value practical expedient. These\ninvestments are recorded within other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Fluctuations in fair value are\nrecognized in earnings within noninterest Income.\n• Measurement Alternative - The Company held equity investments measured using the measurement alternative of $9.5 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $12.1 million at September 30, 2023 within other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity investments measured using the measurement alternative are subject to fair value adjustments when observable price changes\nin orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer occur. The Company did not recognize any fair value\nadjustments in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Additionally, the Company recognized impairment loss of $1.0\nmillion and $3.3 million of such investments during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (\"LHFS\")\nLoans are designated as LHFS based on management's intent to sell loans, or portions of loans, in established secondary markets or to\nparticipating third-party financial institutions. LHFS are held at the lower of cost or fair value. Any amount by which the cost exceeds fair value is\ninitially recorded as a valuation allowance and subsequently reflected in the gain or loss on sale when sold. At September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nthere was no valuation allowance recorded for LHFS. Gains and losses on LHFS are recorded in noninterest income on the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. Loan costs and fees are deferred at origination and are recognized in income at the time of sale. Interest income is\ncalculated based on the note rate of the loan and is recorded as interest income. The Company occasionally transfers loans between held for\nsale and held for investment classifications based on its intent and ability to hold or sell loans. Management's intent to sell may be impacted by\nsecondary market conditions, loan credit quality, or other factors.\n88\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the activity pertaining to loans held for sale:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Consumer Commercial Consumer Commercial\nBeginning of year balance $ 77,779 $ — $ 21,071 $ —\nOriginations 1,901,593 133,388 1,206,201 2,483\nProceeds from sales (1,937,079) (99,005) (1,123,271) (16,610)\nGain (loss) on sales — 5,102 — 268\nPrincipal collections, net of deferred fees and costs (18,083) (48) (26,222) 280\nNon-cash transfers, net — 563,495 — 13,579\nEnd of year balance $ 24,210 $ 602,932 $ 77,779 $ —\nLOANS AND LEASES\nLoans Receivable\nLoans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are classified as held\nfor investment and are generally reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, cumulative charge-offs,\nunamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans (amortized cost).\nInterest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based upon the amount of principal outstanding except when serious doubt exists\nas to the collectability of a loan, in which case the accrual of interest is discontinued. Unearned income, deferred loan fees and costs, and\ndiscounts and premiums are amortized to interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the interest method. The Company's\nbusiness lines follow a nonaccrual policy with certain commercial finance, consumer finance and tax service loans not generally being placed on\nnon-accrual status, but instead are charged off when the collection of principal and interest become doubtful. When placed on nonaccrual status,\nthe accrued unpaid interest receivable is reversed against interest income and any remaining amortizing of net deferred fees is suspended.\nCash collected on these loans is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan with any remainder being recognized as interest income.\nGenerally, a loan can return to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the terms of the loan agreement\nand collectability of the remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. Loans are considered past due when contractually required\nprincipal or interest payments have not been made on the due dates.\nFor commercial loans, the Company generally fully charges off or charges down to net realizable value (fair value of collateral, less estimated\ncosts to sell) for loans secured by collateral when: management judges the loans to be uncollectible; repayment is deemed to be protracted\nbeyond reasonable time frames; the loan has been classified as a loss by either the Company's internal loan review process or its banking\nregulatory agencies; the customer has filed bankruptcy and the loss becomes evident owing to lack of assets; or the loan meets a defined\nnumber of days past due unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. For consumer loans, the Company fully charges\noff or charges down to net realizable value when deemed uncollectible due to bankruptcy or other factors, or meets a defined number of days\npast due.\nLeases Receivable\nThe Company provides various types of commercial lease financing that are classified for accounting purposes as direct financing, sales-type or\noperating leases. Leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the lessee are classified as direct financing or\nsales-type leases and are included in loans and leases receivable on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Direct financing and\nsales-type leases are carried at the combined present value of future minimum lease payments and lease residual values. The determination of\nlease classification requires various judgments and estimates by management, including the fair value of equipment at lease inception, useful life\nof the equipment under lease, lease residual value, and collectability of minimum lease payments.\n89\nTable of Contents\nSales-type leases generate a gain or loss at lease inception by recording lease revenue less lease cost. Lease revenue consists of the present\nvalue of the future minimum lease payments. Lease cost consists of the lease equipment’s book value, less the present value of its residual.\nInterest income on direct financing and sales-type leases is recognized using methods that approximate a level yield over the fixed, non-\ncancelable term of the lease. Recognition of interest income is generally discontinued at the time the lease becomes 90 days delinquent, unless\nthe lease is well-secured and in process of collection. Delinquency and past due status is based on the contractual terms of the lease. The\nCompany receives pro rata rent payments for the interim period until the lease contract commences and the fixed, non-cancelable lease term\nbegins. Interim payments are recognized in the month they are earned and are recorded in interest income. Management has policies and\nprocedures in place for the determination of lease classification and review of the related judgments and estimates for all lease financings.\nThe Company generally fully charges off or charges down to net realizable value (fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell) for leases\nwhen management judges the lease to be uncollectible; repayment is deemed to be protracted beyond reasonable time frames; the lease has\nbeen classified as a loss by either the Company's internal review process or its banking regulatory agencies; the customer has filed bankruptcy\nand the loss becomes evident owing to lack of assets; or the lease meets a defined number of days past due unless the lease is both well-\nsecured and in the process of collection.\nSome lease financings include a residual value component, which represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the expiration\nof the initial term of the transaction. The estimation of the residual value involves judgments regarding product and technology changes,\ncustomer behavior, shifts in supply and demand, and other economic assumptions. The Company may purchase and sell minimum lease\npayments, primarily as a credit risk reduction tool, to third-party financial institutions at fixed rates on a non-recourse basis with its underlying\nequipment as collateral. For those transactions that achieve sale treatment, the related lease cash flow stream and the non-recourse financing\nare derecognized. For those transactions that do not achieve sale treatment, the underlying lease remains on the Company’s Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition and non-recourse debt is recorded in the amount of the proceeds received. The Company retains servicing of\nthese leases and bills, collects, and remits funds to the third-party financial institution. Upon default by the lessee, the third-party financial\ninstitutions may take control of the underlying collateral which the Company would otherwise retain as residual value.\nLeases that do not transfer substantially all benefits and risks of ownership to the lessee are classified as operating leases. Such leased\nequipment are included in rental equipment on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and are depreciated on a straight-line basis\nover the term of the lease to its estimated residual value.\nDepreciation expense is recorded as operating lease equipment depreciation expense within noninterest expense. Operating lease rental\nincome is recognized when it becomes due and is reflected as a component of noninterest income. The Company evaluates the carrying value\nof rental equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully\nrecoverable. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value, where\nfair value is based on the condition of the rental equipment and the projected net cash flows from rental and sale adjusted for current market\nconditions. A $2.0 million impairment expense from rental equipment was recognized for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, a nominal\nimpairment expense was recognized for fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and no impairment expense was recognized for the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2022.\nLoan Servicing and Transfers of Financial Assets\nThe Company sells loan participations, generally without recourse, in both the commercial and consumer segments. The Company also sells\ncommercial SBA and USDA loans to third parties, generally without recourse. Sold loans are not included in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Bank generally retains the right to service the sold loans for a fee. If the fee is determined commensurate and customary with\nmarket terms, no servicing asset or liability is recorded. Any fee that is above or below market terms results in a servicing asset or liability and is\nincluded within Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank was servicing\nloans for others with aggregate unpaid principal balances of $364.5 million and $332.5 million, respectively. The service fees and ancillary\nincome related to these loans were immaterial.\n90\nTable of Contents\nTransfers of loans, portions of loans meeting the definition of a participating interest, and other financial assets are accounted for as sales on the\ntransaction settlement date when control has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the\nassets have been legally isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking\nadvantage of such right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the\ntransferred assets through a repurchase agreement or other means. Upon sale, the loans or other financial assets are derecognized from the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. If the transfer does not satisfy the aforementioned control criteria, the transaction is\nrecorded as a secured borrowing with the loans or other financial assets remaining on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition and proceeds recognized as a liability.\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe ACL represents management’s estimate of current credit losses expected to be incurred by the loan and lease portfolio over the life of each\nfinancial asset as of the balance sheet date. The Company individually evaluates loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics\nwith other financial assets, which generally means loans and leases on nonaccrual status. All other loans and leases are evaluated collectively\nfor credit loss. A reserve for unfunded credit commitments such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments is recorded in other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nIndividually evaluated loans and leases are a key component of the ACL. Generally, the Company measures credit loss on individually evaluated\nloans based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, as the Company considers these financial assets to be collateral\ndependent. If an individually evaluated loan or lease is not collateral dependent, credit loss is measured at the present value of expected future\ncash flows discounted at the loan or lease initial effective interest rate. Management has also identified certain structured finance credits for\nalternative energy projects in which a substantial cash collateral account has been established to mitigate credit risk. Due to the nature of the\ntransactions and significant cash collateral positions, these credits are evaluated individually.\nCredit loss for all other loans and leases is evaluated collectively by various characteristics. The collective evaluation of expected losses in all\ncommercial finance portfolios is based on a cohort loss rate and adjustments for forward-looking information, including industry and\nmacroeconomic forecasts. The cohort loss rate is a life of loan loss rate that immediately reverts to historical loss information for the remaining\nmaturity of the financial asset. Management has elected to use a twelve to twenty-four month reasonable and supportable forecast for forward-\nlooking information. Factors utilized in the determination of the allowance include historical loss experience, current economic forecasts and\nmeasurement date credit characteristics such as product type, delinquency, and industry. The unfunded credit commitments depend on these\nsame factors, as well as estimates of lines of credit usage. The various quantitative and qualitative factors used in the methodologies are\nreviewed quarterly.\nThe collective evaluation of expected credit losses for certain consumer lending portfolios utilize different methodologies when estimating\nexpected credit losses. The determination of the allowance is governed by structured tiers that dictate how cash collections are applied to losses\nto assess if there are sufficient available funds to cover expected credit losses.\nThe amount of ACL depends significantly on management’s estimates or key factors and assumptions affecting valuation, appraisals of\ncollateral, evaluations of performance and status, the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received, forecasts of future\neconomic conditions and reversion periods. Such estimates, appraisals, evaluations, cash flows and forecasts may be subject to frequent\nadjustments due to changing economic prospects of borrowers, lessees, properties or economic conditions. These estimates are reviewed\nquarterly and adjustments, if necessary, are recorded in the provision for credit loss in the periods in which they become known.\nAccrued interest receivable is presented separately on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and an ACL is not recorded for these\nbalances. Generally, when a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status, typically when the collection of interest or principal is 90 days or more\npast due, uncollected interest accrued in prior years is charged off against the ACL and interest accrued in the current year is reversed against\ninterest income.\n91\nTable of Contents\nManagement maintains a framework of controls over the estimation process for the ACL, including review of collective reserve methodologies for\ncompliance with GAAP. Management has a quarterly process to review the appropriateness of historical observation periods and loss\nassumptions and risk ratings assigned to loans and leases, if applicable. Management reviews its qualitative framework and the effect on the\ncollective reserve compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends. Management also maintains controls over\ninformation systems, models and spreadsheets used in the quantitative components of the reserve estimate. This includes the quality and\naccuracy of historical data used to derive loss rates, the inputs to industry and macroeconomic forecasts and the reversion periods utilized. The\nresults of this process are summarized and presented to management quarterly for their approval of the recorded allowance. See Note 3. Loans\nand Leases, Net for further information.\nThe following are risk characteristics of the Company’s loan and lease portfolio:\nCommercial Finance\nThe Company's Commercial Finance business line offers a variety of products through its working capital, equipment finance, structured finance,\nand insurance premium finance lending solutions. These products include term lending, asset-based lending, factoring, lease financing,\ninsurance premium finance, government guaranteed lending and other commercial finance products offered on a nationwide basis that are\nsubject to adverse market conditions which may impact the borrower’s ability to make repayment on the loan or lease or could cause a decline in\nthe value of the collateral that secures the loan or lease. The loans or leases are primarily made based on the operating cash flows of the\nborrower and on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers may be volatile and the value of the collateral\nsecuring these loans and leases may be difficult to measure. Most commercial finance loans and leases are secured by the assets being\nfinanced or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory. Although the loans and leases are often collateralized by equipment,\ninventory, accounts receivable, insurance premiums or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default may\nbe an insufficient source of repayment, because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of\nlimited use. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by adhering to its underwriting policies in evaluating the management of the business\nand the credit-worthiness of borrowers and guarantors. See Note 20. Subsequent Events for further information on the Company's commercial\npremium finance insurance business.\nConsumer Finance\nThe Bank offers a variety of installment and revolving consumer lending products through its credit solutions. The Bank designs its credit\nprogram relationships with certain desired outcomes, including liquidity, credit protection, and risk retention by the program partner. The Bank\nbelieves the benefits of these outcomes not only support its goals but the goals of the credit program partner as well. The Bank designs its\nprogram credit protections in a manner so that the Bank earns a reasonable risk adjusted return, but is protected by certain layers of credit\nsupport, similar to what you would find in structured finance. Certain loans are sold to third parties based on terms and conditions within the\nProgram Agreement.\nTax Services\nThe Bank's Partner Solutions business line also offers tax solutions, which includes short-term refund advance loans. Through this product,\ntaxpayers are underwritten to determine eligibility for these unsecured loans. Due to the nature of refund advance loans, it typically takes no\nmore than three e-file cycles (the period of time between scheduled IRS payments) from when the return is accepted by the IRS to collect from\nthe borrower. In the event of default, the Bank has no recourse against the tax consumer. When collection of principal becomes doubtful, the\nBank will charge off the balance of a refund advance loan on September 30. Any remaining balances are charged off at the end of the calendar\nyear. The Bank may record recoveries of previously charged off loans if collected in subsequent tax years.\nThe Bank offers short-term electronic return originator (\"ERO\") advance loans on a nationwide basis. These loans are typically utilized by tax\npreparers to purchase tax preparation software and to prepare tax office operations for the upcoming tax season. EROs go through an\nunderwriting process to determine eligibility for the unsecured advances. ERO loans are not collateralized. Collection on ERO advances begins\nonce the ERO begins to process refund transfers. Generally, the Bank will charge off the balance of an ERO advance loan if there is a balance\nat the end of June, or when collection of principal becomes doubtful.\n92\nTable of Contents\nWarehouse Finance\nThe Bank participates in several collateral-based warehouse lines of credit whereby the Bank is in a senior, secured position as the first out\nparticipant. These facilities are primarily collateralized by consumer receivables, with the Bank holding a senior collateral position enhanced by a\nsubordinate party structure.\nPREMISES, FURNITURE, AND EQUIPMENT\nLand is carried at cost. Buildings, furniture, fixtures, leasehold improvements, internal-use software and equipment are carried at cost, less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company primarily uses the straight-line method of depreciation and amortization over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets, which is 39 years for buildings, three years for internal-use software, and range from two years to 15 years\nfor leasehold improvements and for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate the carrying\namount may not be recoverable. See Note 5. Premises, Furniture and Equipment, Net for further information.\nGOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired (including identifiable intangibles) in transactions accounted for as\nbusiness acquisitions. Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment at a reporting unit level. The Company has determined that its reporting\nunits are one level below the operating segments and distinguish these reporting units based on how the segments and reporting units are\nmanaged, taking into consideration the economic characteristics, nature of the products, and customers of the segments and reporting units.\nThe Company performs its impairment evaluation as of September 30 of each fiscal year unless a triggering event occurs that would require an\ninterim impairment evaluation. The Company generally utilizes a qualitative approach during this annual assessment to determine whether it is\nmore likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we determine\nit is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, then a quantitative assessment is performed to determine fair value of the reporting unit. If the\ncarrying amount of the reporting unit with goodwill exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and is written down by the excess\ncarrying value of the reporting unit. Subsequent increases in goodwill are not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. No goodwill\nimpairment was recognized during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 or 2022. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for\nfurther information.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their respective estimated lives. All intangible assets are subject to an impairment test at\nleast annually or more often if conditions indicate a possible impairment. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\nSTOCK COMPENSATION\nCompensation expense for share-based awards is recorded over the vesting period at the fair value of the award at the time of grant. The fair\nvalue of nonvested (restricted) shares and performance share units granted under the Company’s incentive plans is equal to the fair market\nvalue of the underlying stock at the grant date, adjusted for dividends where applicable. The Company has elected to record forfeitures as they\noccur. See Note 12. Stock Compensation for further information.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company records income tax expense based on the amount of taxes due on its tax return plus deferred taxes computed based on the\nexpected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted\ntax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some\nportion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes a tax position as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax\nposition would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount\nof tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no\ntax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in noninterest income or noninterest\nexpense. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recorded in income tax expense in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations in the period in which the enactment date occurs. If current period income tax rates change, the impact on the annual\neffective income tax rate is applied year to date in the period of enactment. See Note 13. Income Taxes for further information.\n93\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK\nThe Company, in the normal course of business, makes commitments to originate loans which are not reflected in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The reserve for these unfunded commitments is included within Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition.\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income and other comprehensive income or loss. Other comprehensive income or loss includes\nthe change in net unrealized holding gains and losses due to market conditions and other non-credit risk factors on AFS debt securities, net of\nreclassification adjustments and tax effects. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized as a separate component of\nstockholders’ equity.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nInterest revenue from loans, leases, and investments is recognized on the accrual basis of accounting as the interest is earned according to the\nterms of the particular loan, lease, or investment. Income from service and other customer charges is recognized as earned. Revenue within the\nConsumer segment is recognized as services are performed and service charges are earned in accordance with the terms of the various\nprograms. Refer to Note 15. Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information.\nEARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (“EPS”)\nBasic EPS is computed using the two-class method by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and\nundistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS\nreflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised, and is computed after giving\nconsideration to the weighted average dilutive effect upon vesting of restricted stock grants and after the allocation of earnings to the\nparticipating securities. See Note 4. Earnings per Common Share for further information.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company has disclosed information on its equity investments and relationships with variable interest entities in Note 1. Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies.\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no loans or deposits outstanding with individuals deemed under Regulation O to be\ndirectors, executive officers and/or employees of the Company.\nRECLASSIFICATION AND REVISION OF PRIOR PERIOD BALANCES\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. These changes and\nreclassifications did not impact previously reported net income or comprehensive income (loss).\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES (\"ASU\")\nThe following ASU was adopted by the Company during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the\nCompany's Consolidated Financial Statements. The following ASU became effective for the Company on October 1, 2023.\nASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The amendments in\nthis ASU eliminate accounting guidance for troubled-debt restructurings (“TDRs”) by creditors in Subtopic ASC 310-40, Receivables – Troubled\nDebt Restructurings by Creditors, and enhance disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings when a borrower is\nexperiencing financial difficulty. The ASU also requires current period gross charge-offs by year of origination to be disclosed for loans and\nleases within scope of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.\nThe following ASUs have been issued and are considered applicable to the Company, but have not yet been adopted as of September 30, 2024.\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU improves reportable segment\ndisclosures primarily by enhancing disclosure requirements about significant segment expenses. The amendments will be effective for the\nCompany beginning with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 and subsequent interim periods. The amendments will be applied\nretrospectively to all prior periods in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of such amendments\nto the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n94\nTable of Contents\nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (ASC 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires enhanced income tax disclosures\nprimarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information to provide further transparency surrounding the Company’s income\ntax position.

At September 30, 2024, there were 195 debt securities AFS in an unrealized loss position.\nManagement assessed each investment security with unrealized losses for credit loss by evaluating qualitative factors, including materiality of\nloss position as a percentage of book value, credit ratings, outstanding principal and interest payments, and changes in the underlying implicit or\nexplicit guarantee of the security, and determined all unrealized losses on these securities were due to adverse market conditions and/or change\nin interest rates versus credit loss. As part of that assessment, management evaluated and concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the\nCompany will not be required and does not intend to sell any of the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost. At September 30, 2024,\nthere was no ACL for debt securities AFS.\n96\nTable of Contents\nThe amortized cost and fair value of debt securities by contractual maturity are shown below. Certain securities have call features which allow\nthe issuer to call the security prior to maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities in MBS because borrowers may have\nthe right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Therefore, MBS are not included in the maturity categories in\nthe following maturity summary. The expected maturities of certain SBA securities may differ from contractual maturities because the borrowers\nmay have the right to prepay the obligation. However, certain prepayment penalties may apply.\nAt September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nFair Fair\nDebt Securities AFS Amortized Cost Value Amortized Cost Value\nDue in one year or less $ 1,826 $ 1,796 $ 5,023 $ 4,971\nDue after one year through five years 14,772 14,211 11,175 10,292\nDue after five years through ten years 70,894 63,636 79,139 66,428\nDue after ten years 463,257 430,210 552,360 497,012\n550,749 509,853 647,697 578,703\nMortgage-backed securities 1,393,549 1,231,368 1,495,636 1,225,525\nTotal debt securities AFS $ 1,944,298 $ 1,741,221 $ 2,143,333 $ 1,804,228\nDebt Securities HTM\nDue after ten years $ 31,060 $ 28,392 $ 34,415 $ 29,571\n31,060 28,392 34,415 29,571\nMortgage-backed securities 2,032 1,844 2,176 1,854\nTotal debt securities HTM $ 33,092 $ 30,236 $ 36,591 $ 31,425\nActivity related to the sale of securities is summarized below.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nSecurities AFS\nProceeds from sales $ — $ — $ 265,951\nGross gains on sales — — 1,742\nGross losses on sales — — 1,588\nNet gain on securities AFS $ — $ — $ 154\nThere was no activity related to the sale of securities held to maturity during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nNo securities were pledged as collateral for public funds on deposit at September 30, 2024 and 2023. No securities were pledged as collateral\nfor individual, trust and estate deposits at September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFRB Stock. The Bank is required by federal law to subscribe to capital stock (divided into shares of $100 each) as a member of the FRB of\nMinneapolis with an amount equal to six per centum of the paid-up capital stock and surplus. One-half of the subscription is paid at time of\napplication, and one-half is subject to call of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. FRB of Minneapolis stock held by the Bank\ntotaled $19.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023. These equity securities are 'restricted' in that they can only be owned by member banks.\nAt fiscal year-end 2024 and 2023, the Company pledged securities with fair values of $533.8 million and $773.6 million against FRB advances,\nrespectively.\nIncluded in interest and dividend income from other investments is $1.2 million, $1.2 million, and $1.2 million related to dividend income on FRB\nstock for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n97\nTable of Contents\nFHLB Stock. The Company’s borrowings from the FHLB are secured by specific investment securities. Such advances can be made pursuant to\nseveral different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities.\nThe investments in the FHLB stock are required investments related to the Company’s membership in and current borrowings from the FHLB of\nDes Moines. The investments in the FHLB of Des Moines could be adversely impacted by the financial operations of the FHLB and actions of\ntheir regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nThe FHLB stock is carried at cost since it is generally redeemable at par value. The carrying value of the stock held at the FHLB was $16.3\nmillion and $8.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At fiscal year-end 2024 and 2023, the Company pledged securities with\nfair values of approximately $1.04 billion and $996.9 million, respectively, as collateral against FHLB advances. There was approximately $136.9\nmillion and $21.3 million of qualifying loans pledged as collateral at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncluded in interest and dividend income from other investments is $0.7 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million related to dividend income on FHLB\nstock for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThese equity securities are ‘restricted’ in that they can only be sold back to the respective institution from which they were acquired or another\nmember institution at par. Therefore, FRB and FHLB stocks are less liquid than other marketable equity securities, and the cost approximates\nfair value.\nEquity Securities. The Company held $3.3 million and $3.4 million in marketable equity securities at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.2 million in unrealized losses on marketable equity securities during the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No such securities were sold during the fiscal year.\nNon-marketable equity securities with a readily determinable fair value totaled $11.8 million and $8.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The Company recognized $1.1 million in unrealized gains and $0.2 million in unrealized losses during the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No such securities were sold during the fiscal year.\nNon-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair value totaled $13.6 million and $16.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, reflecting the Company's ownership interests in other entities through Pathward Venture Capital, LLC, a wholly-owned service\ncorporation subsidiary of the Bank that was formed in 2017 for the purpose of making minority equity investments and other corporate\ninvestments. During the fiscal year, the Company recognized a $2.4 million gain on Visa shares previously carried at cost basis of $0 since 2008.\nOn April 8, 2024, Visa Inc. announced the commencement of an exchange offer for Visa Class B-1 common stock and the Company\nsubsequently tendered its Visa Class B-1 common stock in exchange for a combination of Visa Class C common stock and Visa Class B-2\ncommon stock. After entering the exchange, the Company sold its Visa Class C common stock and Visa Class B-2 common stock in the\nsecondary market. There was one additional security sold during the fiscal year for a $2.5 million gain which is included in gain on sale of other\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEquity Securities Impairment. The Company evaluates impairment for investments held at cost on at least an annual basis based on the ultimate\nrecoverability of the par value. All other equity investments, including those under the equity method, are reviewed for other-than-temporary\nimpairment on at least a quarterly basis. The Company recognized $1.0 million, $3.3 million, and zero in impairment for such investments for the\nfiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n98\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 3.

Due to the nature of the transactions and significant cash collateral positions, these credits are evaluated\nindividually. The balance of these pass rated cash collateral loans totaled $105.1 million and $117.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nFederal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by the Bank's primary\nregulator, the OCC, to be of lesser quality as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” The loan classification and risk rating definitions are as follows:\nPass - A pass asset is of sufficient quality in terms of repayment, collateral and management to preclude a special mention or an adverse rating.\nWatch - A watch asset is generally a credit performing well under current terms and conditions but with identifiable weakness meriting additional\nscrutiny and corrective measures. Watch is not a regulatory classification but can be used to designate assets that are exhibiting one or more\nweaknesses that deserve management’s attention. These assets are of better quality than special mention assets.\nSpecial Mention - A special mention asset is a credit with potential weaknesses deserving management’s close attention and, if left uncorrected,\nmay result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an\ninstitution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Special mention is a temporary status with aggressive credit management required\nto garner adequate progress and move to watch or higher.\nThe adverse classifications are as follows:\nSubstandard - A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the net worth and/or repayment ability or by a weak collateral position. Assets\nso classified will have well-defined weaknesses creating a distinct possibility the Bank will sustain some loss if the weaknesses are not\ncorrected. Loss potential does not have to exist for an asset to be classified as substandard.\nDoubtful - A doubtful asset has weaknesses similar to those classified substandard, with the degree of weakness causing the likely loss of some\nprincipal in any reasonable collection effort. Due to pending factors, the asset’s classification as loss is not yet appropriate.\nLoss - A loss asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that the asset’s continuance on the Bank’s balance sheet is no longer\nwarranted. This classification does not necessarily mean an asset has no recovery or salvage value leaving room for future collection efforts.\n103\nTable of Contents\nLoans and leases, or portions thereof, are generally charged off when collection of principal becomes doubtful. Typically, this is associated with a\ndelay or shortfall in payments of 210 days or more for commercial insurance premium finance, 120 days or more for consumer credit products\nand leases, and 90 days or more for commercial finance loans. Action is taken to charge off ERO loans if such loans have not been collected by\nthe end of June and refund advance loans if such loans have not been collected by the end of the calendar year. The Company individually\nevaluates loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, which generally means loans and leases\nidentified as modifications or loans and leases on nonaccrual status.\nThe Company recognizes that concentrations of credit may naturally occur and may take the form of a large volume of related loans and leases\nto an individual, a specific industry, or a geographic location. Credit concentration is a direct, indirect, or contingent obligation that has a common\nbond where the aggregate exposure equals or exceeds a certain percentage of the Company’s Tier 1 Capital plus the allowable Allowance for\nCredit Losses.\nThe Company has various portfolios of consumer finance and tax services loans that present unique risks that are statistically managed. Due to\nthe unique risks associated with these portfolios, the Company monitors other credit quality indicators in its evaluation of the appropriateness of\nthe ACL on these portfolios, and as such, these loans are not included in the asset classification table below. The outstanding balances of\nconsumer finance loans and tax services loans were $248.8 million and $8.8 million at September 30, 2024, respectively, and $254.4 million and\n$5.2 million at September 30, 2023, respectively.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (\"EPS\")\nThe Company has granted restricted share awards with dividend rights that are considered to be participating securities. Accordingly, a portion of\nthe Company’s earnings is allocated to those participating securities in the earnings per share calculation under the two-class method. Basic\nEPS is computed using the two-class method by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and\nundistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS\nis calculated using the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury stock method. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could\noccur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised, and is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average\ndilutive effect upon vesting of performance share units (\"PSUs\") and restricted stock grants, the exercise of stock options, if any, and after the\nallocation of earnings to the participating securities. Antidilutive securities are disregarded in earnings per share calculations. Diluted EPS shown\nbelow reflects the two-class method, as diluted EPS under the two-class method was more dilutive than under the treasury stock method.\nA reconciliation of net income and common stock share amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is presented\nbelow.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2022\nBasic income per common share:\nNet income attributable to Pathward Financial, Inc. $ 168,357 $ 163,615 $ 156,386\nDividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (1,542) (2,453) (2,565)\nBasic net earnings available to common stockholders 166,815 161,162 153,821\nUndistributed earnings allocated to nonvested restricted stockholders 1,495 2,372 2,468\nReallocation of undistributed earnings to nonvested restricted stockholders (1,493) (2,364) (2,468)\nDiluted net earnings available to common stockholders $ 166,817 $ 161,170 $ 153,821\nTotal weighted-average basic common shares outstanding 25,169,937 26,833,079 29,227,071\nEffect of dilutive securities(1)\nPerformance share units 31,813 92,527 5,176\nTotal effect of dilutive securities 31,813 92,527 5,176\nTotal weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding 25,201,750 26,925,606 29,232,247\nNet earnings per common share:\nBasic earnings per common share $ 6.63 $ 6.01 $ 5.26\nDiluted earnings per common share(2) $ 6.62 $ 5.99 $ 5.26\n(1) Represents the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of performance share units and restricted stock, as applicable, utilizing the treasury stock method.\n(2) Excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, were 232,601, 408,477, and 487,476\nweighted average shares of nonvested restricted stock because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\n110\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 5.

STOCK COMPENSATION\nThe Company previously maintained the Pathward Financial, Inc. 2002 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the \"Prior Omnibus\nIncentive Plan\"). No awards were granted under the Prior Omnibus Incentive Plan following November 25, 2022, the date that the Prior Omnibus\nIncentive Plan expired by its terms. On February 27, 2024, the shareholders of the Company voted to approve the Pathward Financial, Inc. 2023\nOmnibus Incentive Plan (the \"Plan\"). The Plan permits the granting of various types of awards including but not limited to nonvested (restricted)\nshares and PSUs to certain officers and directors of the Company. Awards may be granted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of\nDirectors based on the performance of the award recipients or other relevant factors.\nShares have previously been granted each year to executives and senior leadership members under the applicable Company incentive plan.\nThese shares vest at various times ranging from immediately to three years based on circumstances at time of grant. The fair value is\ndetermined based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the grant date. Director shares are issued to the Company’s directors, and\nthese shares have historically vested from immediately to up to one year from the grant date.\nThe Company also grants selected executives PSU awards. The vesting of these awards is contingent on meeting company-wide performance\ngoals, including earnings per share. PSUs are generally granted at the market value of the underlying share on the date of grant, adjusted for\ndividends, as PSUs do not participate in dividends. The awards contingently vest over a period of three years and have payout levels ranging\nfrom a threshold of 50% to a maximum of 200%. Upon vesting, each PSU earned is converted into one share of common stock.\nThe fair value of the PSUs is determined by the dividend-adjusted fair value on the grant date for those awards subject to a performance\ncondition. For those PSUs subject to a market condition, a simulation valuation is performed.\nIn addition, during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2017, shares were granted to certain executive officers of the Company in\nconnection with their signing of employment agreements with the Company. These stock awards vest in equal installments over eight years.\nThe following tables show the activity of share awards (including shares of restricted stock subject to vesting, fully-vested restricted stock, and\nPSUs) granted, exercised or forfeited under all of the Company’s incentive plans during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nWeighted Average Fair\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Number of Shares Value at Grant\nNonvested shares outstanding, September 30, 2023 370,151 $ 35.87\nGranted 181,117 50.61\nVested (288,734) 40.22\nForfeited or expired (13,864) 42.49\nNonvested shares outstanding, September 30, 2024 248,670 $ 41.19\nNonvested shares outstanding, September 30, 2022 474,348 $ 36.52\nGranted 135,417 36.68\nVested (229,803) 37.46\nForfeited or expired (9,811) 41.14\nNonvested shares outstanding, September 30, 2023 370,151 $ 35.87\n116\nTable of Contents\nWeighted Average Fair Value\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Number of Units at Grant\nPerformance share units outstanding, September 30, 2023 155,804 $ 41.20\nGranted(1) 52,125 49.61\nVested (60,984) 55.47\nForfeited or expired (4,483) 44.59\nPerformance share units outstanding, September 30, 2024 142,462 $ 47.24\nPerformance share units outstanding, September 30, 2022 96,689 $ 42.59\nGranted(2) 59,115 38.94\nVested — —\nForfeited or expired — —\nPerformance share units outstanding, September 30, 2023 155,804 $ 41.20\n(1) The activity in this table includes 60,984 shares related to the fiscal year 2021 PSUs, which are included in this table under the assumption of a target performance achievement.\nThe final performance was assessed after September 30, 2023, resulted in an achievement greater than target, and an additional 47,252 shares were allocated to the participants\nin the plan.\n(2) The number of PSUs granted reflects the target number of PSUs able to be earned under a given award.\nCompensation expense for share-based awards is recorded over the vesting period at the fair value of the award at the time of the grant. The\nexercise price of fair value of nonvested (restricted) shares and PSUs granted under the Company’s incentive plans is equal to the fair market\nvalue of the underlying stock at the grant date, adjusted for dividends where applicable.

These credits will begin to expire on September 30, 2042.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had a gross deferred tax asset of $3.0 million for separate company state cumulative net operating loss\ncarryforwards, for which $3.0 million was reserved. At September 30, 2023, the Company had a gross deferred tax asset of $2.7 million for\nseparate company state cumulative net operating loss carryforwards, for which $2.7 million was reserved. These state operating loss\ncarryforwards will expire in various subsequent periods.\nIn general, management believes that the realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on the expectations as to future\ntaxable income; therefore, there was no deferred tax valuation allowance at September 30, 2024, or 2023 with the exception of the state\ncumulative net operating loss carryforwards discussed above.\n118\nTable of Contents\nThe table below reconciles the statutory federal income tax expense and rate to the effective income tax expense and rate for the fiscal years\npresented. The Company's effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income tax expense.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate\nStatutory federal income tax expense and rate $ 41,746 21.0 % $ 38,248 21.0 % $ 38,714 21.0 %\nChange in tax rate resulting from:\nState income taxes net of federal benefits 7,875 4.0 % 7,047 3.9 % 7,413 4.0 %\n162(m) disallowance 1,874 0.9 % 919 0.5 % 1,125 0.4 %\nTax exempt income (690) (0.3)% (783) (0.4)% (743) (0.4)%\nGeneral business credits (21,132) (10.6)% (28,633) (15.7)% (17,589) (9.5)%\nOther, net (532) (0.3)% (474) (0.3)% (956) (0.3)%\nIncome tax expense $ 29,141 14.7 % $ 16,324 9.0 % $ 27,964 15.2 %\nThe Company uses the flow through method of accounting for investment tax credits under which the credits are recognized as a reduction to\nincome tax expense in the period in which the credit arises. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, $19.7 million,\n$27.4 million, and $16.8 million in investment tax credits were recognized as a reduction to income tax expense, respectively.\nThe Company’s tax reserves reflect management’s judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While the\nCompany believes that its reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an\nissue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With respect to these reserves, the\nCompany’s income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding a tax issue, and (ii) any difference from the Company’s tax position as recorded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period.\nThe tax years ended September 30, 2021 and later remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. For state purposes, the tax\nyears ended September 30, 2021 and later remain open for examination, with few exceptions.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits follows:\nAt September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of fiscal year $ 521 $ 645\nAdditions (reductions) for tax positions related to prior years 56 (124)\nBalance at end of fiscal year $ 577 $ 521\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective rate was $540,000 as of September 30, 2024. The\nCompany recognizes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The amount of accrued interest\nrelated to unrecognized tax benefits was $93,000 as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not anticipate any significant change in the\ntotal amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.\n119\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 14. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON RETAINED EARNINGS\nThe Company and the Bank are required to comply with the regulatory capital rules administered by federal banking agencies (the \"Capital\nRules\"). Under the Capital Rules and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital\nguidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s and Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated\nunder regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments\nby regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nThe Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based capital and Tier\n1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and a leverage ratio consisting of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to\naverage assets (as defined). At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank exceeded federal regulatory minimum capital requirements to\nbe classified as well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action requirements. The Company and the Bank took the AOCI opt-out election;\nunder the rule, non-advanced approach banking organizations were given a one-time option to exclude certain AOCI components.\nThe table below includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the\ncapital position of financial services companies. Management reviews these measures along with other measures of capital as part of its\nfinancial analyses and has included this non-GAAP financial information, and the corresponding reconciliation to total equity.\nMinimum\nto be Adequately Minimum to be Well\nCapitalized Under Capitalized Under\nPrompt Corrective Prompt Corrective\nCompany Bank Action Provisions Action Provisions\nAt September 30, 2024\nTier 1 leverage capital ratio 9.26 % 9.44 % 4.00 % 5.00 %\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital ratio 12.61 13.12 4.50 6.50\nTier 1 capital ratio 12.86 13.12 6.00 8.00\nTotal capital ratio 14.08 13.97 8.00 10.00\nAt September 30, 2023\nTier 1 leverage capital ratio 8.11 % 8.32 % 4.00 % 5.00 %\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital ratio 11.25 11.81 4.50 6.50\nTier 1 capital ratio 11.50 11.81 6.00 8.00\nTotal capital ratio 12.84 12.76 8.00 10.00\n120\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the amounts included in the table above for the Company.\nStandardized Approach(1)\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nTotal stockholders' equity $ 839,605 $ 650,625\nAdjustments:\nLESS: Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities 296,105 297,679\nLESS: Certain other intangible assets 18,018 21,228\nLESS: Net deferred tax assets from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards 13,253 19,679\nLESS: Net unrealized (losses) on available for sale securities (152,328) (254,294)\nLESS: Noncontrolling interest (277) (1,005)\nADD: Adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 1,345 2,017\nCommon Equity Tier 1(1) 666,179 569,355\nLong-term borrowings and other instruments qualifying as Tier 1 13,661 13,661\nTier 1 minority interest not included in common equity Tier 1 capital (150) (826)\nTotal Tier 1 capital 679,690 582,190\nAllowance for credit losses 44,687 47,960\nSubordinated debentures, net of issuance costs 19,693 19,591\nTotal capital $ 774,070 $ 649,741\n(1) Capital ratios were determined using the Basel III capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015. Basel III revised the definition of capital, increased minimum capital\nratios, and introduced a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio; those changes were fully phased in through the end of 2021.\nThe Company and the Bank are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order\nto avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital\nconservation buffer is exclusively composed of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not\nthe leverage ratio. The required Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios with the buffer are\ncurrently 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively.\nBased on current and expected continued profitability and subject to continued access to capital markets, we believe that the Company and the\nBank will continue to meet the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% in addition to required minimum capital ratios.\nNOTE 15. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nTopic 606 applies to all contracts with customers unless such revenue is specifically addressed under existing guidance. The table below\npresents the Company’s revenue by operating segment.

Additional details are included in other footnotes to the accompanying financial statements. The scope of Topic 606\nexplicitly excludes net interest income as well as many other revenues for financial assets and liabilities, including loans, leases, and securities.\nFollowing is a discussion of key revenues within the scope of Topic 606. The Company provides services to customers that have related\nperformance obligations that must be completed to recognize revenue. Revenues are generally recognized immediately upon the completion of\nthe service or over time as services are performed. Any services performed over time generally require that the Company renders services each\nperiod; therefore, the Company measures progress in completing these services based upon the passage of time. Revenue from contracts with\ncustomers did not generate significant contract assets and liabilities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\nRefund Transfer Product Fees. Refund transfer fees are specific to the Partner Solutions business line and reflect product fees offered by the\nCompany through third-party tax preparers and tax preparation software providers where the Company acts as the partnering financial\ninstitution. A refund transfer allows a taxpayer to pay tax preparation and filing fees directly from their federal or state government tax refund,\nwith the remainder of the refund being disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the taxpayer agreement, which may include\nsatisfaction of other disbursement obligations before going directly to the taxpayer via check, direct deposit, or prepaid card. Refund transfer\nfees are recognized by the Company immediately after the taxpayer's refund has been disbursed in accordance with the contract and are based\non standalone pricing included within the terms and conditions. Certain expenses to tax preparation software providers are netted with refund\ntransfer fee income as the Company is considered the agent in these contractual relationships. All refund transfer fees are recorded within the\nConsumer reporting segment.\nCard and Deposit Fees. Card fees relate to the Partner Solutions business line and consist of income from prepaid cards and merchant services,\nincluding interchange fees from prepaid cards processed through card association networks, merchant services and other card related services.\nInterchange rates are generally set by card association networks based on transaction volume and other factors. Since interchange fees are\ngenerated by cardholder activity, the Company recognizes the income as transactions occur. Fee income for merchant services and other card\nrelated services reflect account management and transaction fees charged to merchants for processing card association network transactions.\nThe associated income is recognized as transactions occur or as services are performed. For the Company's internally managed prepaid card\nprograms, fees are based on standalone pricing within the terms and conditions of the cardholder agreement. The Company is considered the\nprincipal of these relationships resulting in all fee income being presented on a gross basis within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For\nthe Company's sponsorship prepaid card programs where a third-party is considered the Program Manager, the fees are based on standalone\npricing within the terms and conditions of the Program Agreement. For these relationships, the Company is considered the agent and certain\nexpenses with the Program Manager, networks and associations are netted with card fee revenue. All card fee income is included in the\nConsumer reporting segment.\n122\nTable of Contents\nDeposit fees relate to the Partner Solutions and Commercial Finance business lines and consist of income from banking and deposit-related\nservices, including account services, overdraft protection, and wire transfers. Fee income for account services is recognized over the course of\nthe month as the performance obligation is satisfied. Fee income for overdraft protection and wire transfers is recognized at the point in time\nwhen such event occurs. For partner solutions, the fees for account services and overdraft protection are based on standalone pricing within the\nterms and conditions of the Program Agreement with the sponsorship partner. For these relationships, the Company is considered the agent and\ncertain expenses with the partner are netted with deposit fee revenue. For Commercial Finance, fees for wire transfers are based on standalone\npricing within the terms and conditions of the customer deposit agreement. Bank and deposit fees for the Partner Solutions and Commercial\nFinance business lines are included in the Consumer and Commercial reporting segments, respectively. Also included within Card and Deposit\nFees for the Consumer reporting segment are servicing fees the Company recognizes for custodial off-balance sheet deposits. This fee income\nis for services the Bank performs to maintain records of cardholder funds placed at one or more third-party banks insured by the FDIC. The\nservicing fee is typically reflective of the EFFR.\nNOTE 16. SEGMENT REPORTING\nAn operating segment is generally defined as a component of a business for which discrete financial information is available and whose results\nare reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker. Operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments if certain criteria are met.\nThe Company reports its results of operations through the following three business segments: Consumer, Commercial, and Corporate\nServices/Other. The Partner Solutions business line is reported in the Consumer segment. The Commercial Finance business line is reported in\nthe Commercial segment.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities using a\nhierarchy system and requires disclosures about fair value measurement. It clarifies that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts.\n127\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1 Inputs - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets that the Company has the ability to\naccess at measurement date.\nLevel 2 Inputs - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments\nin markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which significant assumptions are observable in the market.\nLevel 3 Inputs - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market and are used\nonly to the extent that observable inputs are not available. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company’s own estimates of\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThere were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nDebt Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity. Debt securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and debt\nsecurities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost.\nThe fair values of debt securities AFS, categorized primarily as Level 2, are recorded using prices obtained from independent asset pricing\nservices that are based on observable transactions, but not quoted markets. Management reviews the prices obtained from independent asset\npricing services for unusual fluctuations and compares to current market trading activity.\nEquity Securities. Marketable equity securities and certain non-marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The\nfair values of marketable equity securities are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1\ninputs).\nThe following tables summarize the fair values of debt securities available for sale and equity securities as they are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\nAt September 30, 2024\n(Dollars in thousands) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDebt securities AFS\nCorporate securities $ 19,750 $ — $ 19,750 —\nSBA securities 81,935 — 81,935 —\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 480 — 480 —\nNon-bank qualified obligations of states and political subdivisions 217,990 — 217,990 —\nAsset-backed securities 189,698 — 189,698 —\nMortgage-backed securities 1,231,368 — 1,231,368 —\nTotal debt securities AFS $ 1,741,221 $ — $ 1,741,221 $ —\nCommon equities and mutual funds(1) $ 3,303 $ 3,303 $ — $ —\nNon-marketable equity securities(2) $ 11,828 $ — $ — $ —\n(1) Equity securities at fair value are included within other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024.\n(2) Consists of certain non-marketable equity securities that are measured at fair value using NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and are excluded from the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\n128\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDebt securities AFS\nCorporate securities $ 18,250 $ — $ 18,250 $ —\nSBA securities 85,242 — 85,242 —\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 2,289 — 2,289 —\nNon-bank qualified obligations of states and political subdivisions 226,723 — 226,723 —\nAsset-backed securities 246,199 — 246,199 —\nMortgage-backed securities 1,225,525 — 1,225,525 —\nTotal debt securities AFS $ 1,804,228 $ — $ 1,804,228 $ —\nCommon equities and mutual funds(1) $ 3,378 $ 3,378 $ — $ —\nNon-marketable equity securities(2) $ 8,389 $ — $ — $ —\n(1) Equity securities at fair value are included within other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition at September 30, 2023.\n(2) Consists of certain non-marketable equity securities that are measured at fair value using NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and are excluded from the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nLoans and Leases. The Company does not record loans and leases at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if a loan or lease is individually\nevaluated for risk of credit loss and repayment is expected to be solely provided by the values of the underlying collateral, the Company\nmeasures fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell.\nThe fair value of the collateral is determined based on the internal estimates and/or assessment provided by third-party appraisers and the\nvaluation relies on discount rates ranging from 3% to 37%.\nThe following tables summarize the assets of the Company that are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition on a nonrecurring basis:\nAt September 30, 2024\n(Dollars in thousands) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nLoans and leases, net individually evaluated for credit loss\nCommercial finance $ 7,652 $ — $ — $ 7,652\nTotal loans and leases, net individually evaluated\nfor credit loss 7,652 — — 7,652\nTotal $ 7,652 $ — $ — $ 7,652\nAt September 30, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nLoans and leases, net individually evaluated for credit loss\nCommercial finance $ 21,829 $ — $ — $ 21,829\nTotal loans and leases, net individually evaluated\nfor credit loss 21,829 — — 21,829\nForeclosed assets, net — — — —\nTotal $ 21,829 $ — $ — $ 21,829\nQuantitative Information About Level 3 Fair Value Measurements\nFair Value at Fair Value at\nSeptember 30, September 30, Valuation\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Technique Unobservable Input Range of Inputs\nLoans and leases, net individually evaluated\nfor credit loss $ 7,652 21,829 Market approach Appraised values(1) 3% - 37%\n(1) The Company generally relies on external appraisers to develop this information.

These fair values estimates were made at September 30, 2024 and 2023\nbased on relevant market information and information about financial instruments. Fair value estimates are intended to represent the price at\nwhich an asset could be sold or a liability could be settled. However, since there is no active market for certain financial instruments of the\nCompany, the estimates of fair value are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and include matters of significant judgment. Changes in\nassumptions as well as tax considerations could significantly affect the estimated values. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value estimates are not\nintended to represent the underlying value of the Company, on either a going concern or a liquidation basis.\nThe following tables present the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the financial instruments held by the Company:\nAt September 30, 2024\nCarrying Estimated\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 158,337 $ 158,337 $ 158,337 $ — $ —\nDebt securities available for sale 1,741,221 1,741,221 — 1,741,221 —\nDebt securities held to maturity 33,092 30,236 — 30,236 —\nCommon equities and mutual funds(1) 3,303 3,303 3,303 — —\nNon-marketable equity securities(1)(2) 21,350 21,350 — 9,522 —\nLoans held for sale 688,870 688,870 — 688,870 —\nLoans and leases 4,071,071 4,036,490 — — 4,036,490\nFederal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stocks 36,014 36,014 — 36,014 —\nAccrued interest receivable 31,385 31,385 31,385 — —\nFinancial liabilities\nDeposits 5,875,085 5,874,994 5,845,879 29,115 —\nOvernight federal funds purchased 377,000 377,000 377,000 — —\nOther short- and long-term borrowings 33,354 31,787 — 31,787 —\nAccrued interest payable 571 571 571 — —\n(1) Equity securities at fair value are included within other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition at September 30, 2024.\n(2) Includes certain non-marketable equity securities that are measured at fair value using NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and are excluded from the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\n130\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2023\nCarrying Estimated\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 375,580 $ 375,580 $ 375,580 $ — $ —\nDebt securities available for sale 1,804,228 1,804,228 — 1,804,228 —\nDebt securities held to maturity 36,591 31,425 — 31,425 —\nCommon equities and mutual funds(1) 3,378 3,378 3,378 — —\nNon-marketable equity securities(1)(2) 20,453 20,453 — 12,064 —\nLoans held for sale 77,779 77,779 — 77,779 —\nLoans and leases 4,359,681 4,223,010 — — 4,223,010\nFederal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stocks 28,210 28,210 — 28,210 —\nAccrued interest receivable 23,282 23,282 23,282 — —\nFinancial liabilities\nDeposits 6,589,182 6,589,065 6,583,648 5,417 —\nOvernight federal funds purchased 13,000 13,000 13,000 — —\nOther short- and long-term borrowings 33,873 31,187 — 31,187 —\nAccrued interest payable 247 247 247 — —\n(1) Equity securities at fair value are included within other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition at September 30, 2023.\n(2) Includes certain non-marketable equity securities that are measured at fair value using NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and are excluded from the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nThe following sets forth the methods and assumptions used in determining the fair value estimates for the Company’s financial instruments at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nThe carrying amount of cash and short-term investments is assumed to approximate the fair value.\nDEBT SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND EQUITY SECURITIES\nFair values for debt securities available for sale are based on quoted prices of similar securities on nationally recognized securities exchanges,\nor matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted\nprices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Fair values for\nmarketable equity securities are based on unadjusted quoted prices from active markets in which the security is traded. Non-marketable equity\nsecurities are measured at fair value using NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE\nLoans held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, where fair value reflects the amount a willing market participant would\npay for the loan. The Company classifies SBA/USDA loans held for sale as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as there is an active secondary\nmarket in which these loans are exchanged. Consumer loans held for sale are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the price at\nwhich these loans are sold are dictated by terms of the Program Agreements with consumer lending partners.\nLOANS AND LEASES\nThe fair values of loans and leases were estimated using an exit price methodology. The exit price estimation of fair value is based on the\npresent value of expected cash flows, which are based on the contractual terms of the loans, adjusted for prepayments and a discount rate\nbased on the relative risk of the cash flows. Other considerations include the loan type, remaining life of the loan and credit risk.\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK STOCKS\nThe fair value of FRB and FHLB stock is assumed to approximate book value since the Company is only able to redeem this stock at par value.\nACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE\nThe carrying amount of accrued interest receivable is assumed to approximate the fair value.\n131\nTable of Contents\nDEPOSITS\nWith the exception of time certificate deposits and wholesale deposits, the carrying values of deposits are assumed to approximate fair value\nsince deposits are immediately withdrawable without penalty. The fair value of time certificate deposits and wholesale certificate of deposits are\nestimated using a discounted cash flows calculation that applies the FHLB Des Moines curve to aggregated expected maturities of time\ndeposits.\nFEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES\nThe fair value of such advances was estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using current interest rates for advances with\nsimilar terms and remaining maturities.\nSUBORDINATED DEBENTURES AND OTHER BORROWINGS\nThe fair value of these instruments was estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using derived interest rates approximating\nmarket over the contractual maturity of such borrowings.\nACCRUED INTEREST PAYABLE\nThe carrying amount of accrued interest payable is assumed to approximate the fair value.\nLIMITATIONS\nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time and are based on relevant market information about the financial\ninstrument. Additionally, fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate\nthe value of anticipated future business, customer relationships and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial\ninstruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company’s entire holdings of a particular\nfinancial instrument for sale at one time. Furthermore, since no market exists for certain of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value\nestimates may be based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various\nfinancial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment\nand therefore cannot be determined with a high level of precision. Changes in assumptions as well as tax considerations could significantly\naffect the estimates. Accordingly, based on the limitations described above, the aggregate fair value estimates are not intended to represent the\nunderlying value of the Company, on either a going concern or a liquidation basis.\nNOTE 20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement has evaluated subsequent events that occurred after September 30, 2024. During this period, up to the filing date of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, management identified the following subsequent events:\n• On October 31, 2024, Pathward, N.A. completed the sale (the \"Transaction\") of substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to the\nBank's commercial insurance premium finance business (the \"Business\") pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement (the\n\"Purchase Agreement\") dated August 28, 2024 with Honor Capital Corporation, a Florida corporation (the \"Purchaser\"), the successor by\nassignment to AFS IBEX Financial Services, LLC, and Honor Capital Holdings, LLC as guarantor.\nThe cash purchase price paid by the Purchaser at the closing was $603.3 million, based on the net asset value of the assets purchased\nand liabilities assumed pursuant to the Purchase Agreement plus a $31.2 million premium, subject to customary post-closing adjustment\nbased on the final determination of the net asset value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed pursuant to the terms of the\nPurchase Agreement. The Bank recorded a gain on the Transaction of $16.4 million.\nAs part of the Transaction, $588.4 million of commercial insurance premium finance loans were sold.\n• On November 1, 2024, the Bank sold $161.6 million of debt securities AFS with a loss on sale of securities of $15.8 million. This loss\nlargely offsets the gain from the Transaction discussed above.\n132\nTable of Contents\nItem 9.

Controls and Procedures.\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nManagement, under the direction of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”)) that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosures.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures. The evaluation was performed under the direction of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to determine\nthe effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that\nevaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures were designed effectively to ensure timely alerting of material information relating to the Company required to be included in the\nCompany’s periodic SEC filings.\nINHERENT LIMITATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurance that its objectives will be\nmet. Furthermore, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been\ndetected. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be\nconsidered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the\nCompany have been detected.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s\ninternal controls over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this\nreport, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-\n15(f) under the 1934 Act) during the fiscal fourth quarter to which this report relates that could have materially affected the Company’s internal\ncontrols over financial reporting.\nMANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\n133\nTable of Contents\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the\ncriteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).”\nBased on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, has been audited by Crowe LLP, the\nindependent registered public accounting firm that also has audited the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Crowe LLP’s attestation report on the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting appears below.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nAdoption or Termination of Trading Arrangements by Directors and Executive Officers\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the 1934 Act) informed us of\nthe adoption or termination of any \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" or \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,\" as those terms are defined in\nItem 408 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot applicable.\n134\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nStockholders and the Board of Directors of Pathward Financial, Inc.\nSioux Falls, South Dakota\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Pathward Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the\nconsolidated statements of financial condition of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of\noperations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\") and our report dated November 26, 2024\nexpressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A\ncompany’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Crowe LLP\nSouth Bend, Indiana\nNovember 26, 2024\n135\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nItem 10.

PARTICIPANT\nBy: ______________________________ By: ______________________________\nName: ___________________________ Par\u0000cipant’s Name: ________________\nTitle: ____________________________ Date: ____________________________\nDate: ____________________________\n5\nExhibit 19.1\nInsider Trading Policy\n1. Overview\nPathward Financial, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless context requires otherwise, the “Company” or “Pathward”) is a publicly traded\ncompany with common stock registered under the Securi\u0000es Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and traded on the\nNASDAQ Global Market (\u0000cker = CASH). Although the Company respects the right of each director and employee of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, including Pathward, Na\u0000onal Associa\u0000on, to engage in investment ac\u0000vi\u0000es and encourages directors and employees to become\nand remain stockholders of the Company, it is important that such prac\u0000ces avoid any appearance of impropriety, as well as remain in full\ncompliance with the law. The Insider Trading Policy (this “Policy”) is designed to ensure and promote compliance with applicable securi\u0000es laws\nthat prohibit certain persons who are aware of material nonpublic informa\u0000on about the Company from trading in securi\u0000es of the Company\nor providing material nonpublic informa\u0000on to other persons who may trade on the basis of that informa\u0000on.\nInsider trading is the buying or selling of a security by someone who has access to material nonpublic informa\u0000on about the issuing company. It\nis illegal to trade while having knowledge of material informa\u0000on that has not been made available to the public.\nThe United States Securi\u0000es and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) takes insider trading very seriously and devotes significant resources to\nuncovering illegal transac\u0000on ac\u0000vity and to prosecu\u0000ng offenders. Liability, including criminal liability, may extend not only to the individuals\nwho trade on inside informa\u0000on, but also to their \u0000ppers, who are the people who provide such inside informa\u0000on. The Company and\ncontrolling persons of the Company may also be liable for viola\u0000ons by Company directors and employees.\nThis Policy assists in the educa\u0000on of Company personnel, sets forth guidelines for courses of ac\u0000on, helps preserve the reputa\u0000on of the\nCompany and its personnel for integrity and ethical conduct and protects the Company and its personnel against legal liability. Through this\nPolicy, the Company seeks to promote compliance with applicable statutes and regula\u0000ons and to avoid even the appearance of improper\nconduct by anyone employed by or associated with, either inside or outside, the Company.\n2. Applicability\nThis Policy applies to all directors and employees, whether full-\u0000me, part-\u0000me or temporary, of the Company. The Company may also\ndetermine that other persons should be subject to this Policy, such as contractors or consultants who have access to material nonpublic\ninforma\u0000on. This Policy also applies to\nPage 1 of 11\nRelated Persons. For purposes of this Policy, a “Related Person” with respect to any director or employee, consists of the family members of\nthe director or employee who reside with him or her, anyone else who lives in the director or employee’s household, and any family members\nwho do not live in the director or employee’s household but whose transac\u0000ons in Company securi\u0000es are directed by him or her or subject to\nhis or her influence or control (e.g., parents or children who consult with the director or employee before engaging in any transac\u0000on in\nCompany securi\u0000es) and any en\u0000\u0000es controlled by the director or employee or for which the director or employee controls investment\ndecisions (e.g., corpora\u0000ons, partnerships, trusts of which the director or employee is a grantor or trustee).\nAll Company directors and employees are accountable to understand, apply, define, and address the responsibili\u0000es and general working\nprocesses applicable to this Policy.\nAny director, employee, or third-party contractor who knowingly or negligently violates this Policy is subject to disciplinary ac\u0000on up to and\nincluding termina\u0000on of employment or termina\u0000on of a contractual agreement. See Sec\u0000on 3.5 for more informa\u0000on on viola\u0000on\nconsequences.\n3. Policy\nThe purpose of this Policy is to provide effec\u0000ve oversight and risk management of insider trading risks that could prevent the Company from\nachieving its goals and objec\u0000ves. This Policy provides guidance to directors and employees for securi\u0000es transac\u0000ons involving Company stock.\nFor purposes of this Policy, the terms “transac\u0000on” and “trade” include any transac\u0000on in Company stock, including gi\u0000s.\n3.1 Company Assistance and Administra\u0000on\nThe Company’s EVP, Chief Legal and Administra\u0000ve Officer (“CLAO”), or the successor to such posi\u0000on for Legal ma\u0000ers, will serve as\nthe Insider Trading Compliance Officer to ensure all directors and employees transact in accordance with this Policy. In the CLAO’s\nabsence, the Company’s EVP, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), SVP, Chief Accoun\u0000ng Officer, or SVP, Deputy General Counsel and\nCorporate Secretary will serve as the Insider Trading Compliance Officer. A director or employee who has a ques\u0000on about this Policy or\nwho is unsure whether certain informa\u0000on is “material” or “nonpublic” should seek addi\u0000onal guidance from the Insider Trading\nCompliance Officer.\nIn general, all directors and employees should avoid taking personal advantage of any material nonpublic informa\u0000on that they may\nacquire, no ma\u0000er how they might have acquired it. Compliance with this Policy is the personal obliga\u0000on of each director and\nemployee.\n3.2 General Policy\nNo director or employee, whether full \u0000me, part-\u0000me or temporary, of the Company shall engage in transac\u0000ons in any securi\u0000es,\nwhether of the Company or of any other public company, while in possession of material nonpublic informa\u0000on regarding such\nsecuri\u0000es. In addi\u0000on, no director, employee or any Related Person (or any other person designated as subject to this Policy) who, in\nthe course of working for the Company, learns of material nonpublic informa\u0000on about another company, such as a customer, supplier,\nvendor, or a poten\u0000al party to a transac\u0000on with the Company, may engage in transac\u0000ons in any securi\u0000es\nPage 2 of 11\nof another publicly traded company the price of which may be affected by such informa\u0000on, while in possession of such material\nnonpublic informa\u0000on. No director or employee shall communicate such material nonpublic informa\u0000on to any person who might use\nsuch informa\u0000on to purchase or sell securi\u0000es, so-called “\u0000pping.”\nMaterial Informa\u0000on. Generally speaking, informa\u0000on is deemed “material” where there is a substan\u0000al likelihood that a reasonable\ninvestor could consider the informa\u0000on important in deciding whether to buy or sell the securi\u0000es in ques\u0000on, or where the\ninforma\u0000on, if disclosed, could be viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of informa\u0000on available.\nWhere the nonpublic informa\u0000on relates to a possible or con\u0000ngent event, materiality depends upon a balancing of both the\nprobability that the event will occur and the an\u0000cipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of a company’s ac\u0000vi\u0000es.\nCommon, but by no means exclusive, examples of “material” informa\u0000on include informa\u0000on concerning:\n• An important no\u0000fica\u0000on from a regulatory authority;\n• Projec\u0000ons of future earnings or losses;\n• News of a pending or proposed merger, acquisi\u0000on or tender offer;\n• News of a pending or proposed acquisi\u0000on or disposi\u0000on of significant assets;\n• Ac\u0000ons of regulatory agencies;\n• News of a pending or proposed acquisi\u0000on of a subsidiary;\n• Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems;\n• Gain or loss of a significant customer or supplier;\n• Significant energy genera\u0000on or supply problems;\n• Significant pricing changes;\n• Stock splits, stock repurchase programs or changes in dividend policy;\n• New equity or debt offers;\n• Significant li\u0000ga\u0000on, either actual or threatened; and\n• A significant cybersecurity threat, a\u0000ack or incident.\nEither posi\u0000ve or nega\u0000ve informa\u0000on may be material. Because materiality determina\u0000ons are o\u0000en challenged with the benefit of\nhindsight, if a director or employee has any doubt whether certain informa\u0000on is “material,” such doubt should be resolved in favor of\nnot trading un\u0000l such informa\u0000on has become public or no longer is material.\nNonpublic Informa\u0000on. Informa\u0000on is “nonpublic” un\u0000l it has been made available to investors generally. In this respect, one must be\nable to point to some fact or event to show that the informa\u0000on is generally public, such as inclusion in reports filed with the SEC or\npress releases issued by a company, or reference to such informa\u0000on in publica\u0000ons of general circula\u0000on. In general, informa\u0000on may\nbe presumed to have been made available to investors a\u0000er two business days from the formal release of such informa\u0000on.\n3.3 Prohibited Transac\u0000ons\n3.3.1 Trading of Company Securi\u0000es\nPage 3 of 11\nIn the handling of informa\u0000on obtained as a result of their employment with or service to the Company, directors and\nemployees must not:\n• Disclose material nonpublic, or other confiden\u0000al informa\u0000on to anyone, inside or outside of the Company,\nincluding Related Persons and third par\u0000es, except on a strict need-to-know basis and under circumstances\nthat make it reasonable to believe that the informa\u0000on will not be misused or improperly disclosed by the\nrecipient.\n• Recommend or suggest that any person or en\u0000ty engage in transac\u0000ons in securi\u0000es, whether of the Company\nor any other companies, while in possession of material nonpublic informa\u0000on about those securi\u0000es.\n• Engage in any transac\u0000ons in securi\u0000es, whether of the Company or any other company, and whether directly\nor indirectly through Related Persons, while in possession of material nonpublic informa\u0000on regarding those\nsecuri\u0000es.\n• Engage in any transac\u0000ons in securi\u0000es of another publicly traded company the price of which may be affected\nby material nonpublic informa\u0000on in the director’s or employee’s possession.\n• Trade in op\u0000ons, warrants, puts, calls, swaps, collars, or similar instruments on Company securi\u0000es.\n• Informa\u0000on that is not material to the Company may nevertheless be material to one of those other firms with\nwhom the Company is conduc\u0000ng business. Under no circumstances should you disclose informa\u0000on to third\npar\u0000es for a consul\u0000ng or advisory fee.\nThese prohibi\u0000ons apply regardless of how the prohibited communica\u0000on occurs, whether orally, in wri\u0000ng, or through social\nmedia channels (e.g., Facebook, Twi\u0000er or LinkedIn).\nIf securi\u0000es transac\u0000ons are ever scru\u0000nized, they will likely be viewed retrospec\u0000vely. Accordingly, before engaging in any\ntransac\u0000on, you should carefully consider how the transac\u0000on may be construed with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.\n3.3.2 Specula\u0000ve Transac\u0000ons\nBecause the Company believes it is generally improper and inappropriate for Company personnel to engage in specula\u0000ve\ntransac\u0000ons involving Company securi\u0000es, it is the Company’s policy that its personnel should not engage in any of the\nfollowing ac\u0000vi\u0000es with respect to Company securi\u0000es:\n• Trading in Company securi\u0000es on a short-term basis\no Any shares of Company common stock purchased in the open market must be held for a minimum of six (6)\nmonths, and preferably longer\n• Hedging\no No director or employee may enter into any transac\u0000on designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market\nvalue of the Company’s securi\u0000es or any specula\u0000ve transac\u0000on involving the Company’s\nPage 4 of 11\nsecuri\u0000es, such as short sales, puts, calls, forward sales or purchase contracts, swaps, or other deriva\u0000ve\ntransac\u0000ons\n• Margin Accounts; Pledging\no Under a margin arrangement, a broker may sell Company securi\u0000es in a margin account at any \u0000me without\nthe director’s or employee’s consent if the value falls below the margin requirements. If the sale is made when\nthe director or employee is aware of material nonpublic informa\u0000on, the director or employee may become\nsubject to insider trading liability, even though he or she did not request the sale\no Similar risks arise when a director or employee pledges Company securi\u0000es as collateral to secure a bank loan\nor other obliga\u0000on\no Directors and employees may not enter into any transac\u0000on by which Company securi\u0000es may be held in a\nmargin brokerage account or pledged as collateral to secure an obliga\u0000on\n3.3.3 Tipping Informa\u0000on to Others\nDirectors and employees may not a) pass on material nonpublic informa\u0000on to anyone, including Related Persons, or b) engage\nin any other ac\u0000on to take advantage of material nonpublic informa\u0000on for the benefit of any such person.\nDirectors and employees may face insider trading liability under applicable securi\u0000es laws for communica\u0000ng or \u0000pping\nmaterial nonpublic informa\u0000on to anyone, including Related Persons, friends, or any other third party (also called a “\u0000ppee”).\nTippees can obtain material nonpublic informa\u0000on by receiving overt \u0000ps from others or through conversa\u0000ons at social,\nbusiness, or other gatherings.\nPersons who are not insiders, which include \u0000ppees who trade on material nonpublic informa\u0000on \u0000pped to them, may also\nface liability for insider trading. Tippees inherit an insider’s du\u0000es and are liable for trading on material nonpublic informa\u0000on\n\u0000pped to them by an insider. Similar to insiders, \u0000ppers may be liable for the insider trading of others who receive informa\u0000on\nfrom \u0000ppees.\n3.3.4 Termina\u0000on of Service\nIf a director or employee’s service to the Company terminates during a blackout period applicable to them (as described below)\nor otherwise while they are aware of material nonpublic informa\u0000on regarding the Company, such person will con\u0000nue to be\nsubject to this Policy, and specifically to the ongoing prohibi\u0000on against trading, un\u0000l such blackout period ends or otherwise\nun\u0000l the informa\u0000on has become public or is no longer material.\n3.3.5 Transac\u0000ons Under Company Plans\nThese restric\u0000ons do not apply in the case of purchases of Company securi\u0000es from the Company or sales of Company\nsecuri\u0000es to the Company, including the following transac\u0000ons, except as specifically noted:\nPage 5 of 11\n• The purchase of common stock upon the exercise of stock op\u0000ons granted by the Company where no broker is involved\nand no stock is sold in the market to fund the op\u0000on exercise; however, the restric\u0000ons do apply to (1) the sale of\nCompany stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of stock; (2) any other market sale for the purpose of\ngenera\u0000ng the cash needed to pay the exercise price of a stock op\u0000on; and (3) the subsequent sale of any Company\nstock obtained as a result of the exercise of a stock op\u0000on.\n• The purchase of common stock pursuant to the Company’s stock purchase plan; however, the restric\u0000ons do apply to\nthe elec\u0000on to par\u0000cipate or change the level of par\u0000cipa\u0000on in such plan; (2) voluntary purchases from addi\u0000onal\ncontribu\u0000ons to such plan; and (3) the sale of any common stock purchased through any such plan.\n• The exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which a recipient of an op\u0000on, stock grant, or other award under\none of the Company’s op\u0000on plans elects to have the Company withhold shares of the Company’s common stock to\nsa\u0000sfy tax withholding requirements.\n3.4 Addi\u0000onal Restric\u0000ons\nThis sec\u0000on applies to Restricted Persons who, because of the nature of their employment or posi\u0000on, are most likely to have access to\nmaterial nonpublic informa\u0000on regarding the Company.\n“Restricted Persons” include (a) all directors and certain execu\u0000ve officers, plus the SVP, Chief Accoun\u0000ng Officer, of the Company and\nany other person who performs a significant policy-making func\u0000on for the Company, as determined by the Board, all of whom are\nrequired to file Sec\u0000on 16 reports with respect to their transac\u0000ons in Company securi\u0000es (“Sec\u0000on 16 Officers”) and (b) all employees\ndesignated by the Insider Trading Compliance Officer from \u0000me to \u0000me as having regular access to material nonpublic informa\u0000on. A\nlist of Restricted Persons will be maintained by the Insider Trading Compliance Officer.\n3.4.1 Quarterly Blackout Periods\nAll Restricted Persons are prohibited from trading in Company securi\u0000es during the following blackout periods:\n• The period from fi\u0000een (15) calendar days prior to the close of each fiscal quarter un\u0000l two (2) full trading days a\u0000er\nthe release of the Company’s financial results for the quarterly repor\u0000ng period.\nThe following types of transac\u0000ons are exempted from this prohibi\u0000on:\n• The purchase of common stock upon the exercise of stock op\u0000ons granted by the Company where no broker is involved\nand no stock is sold in the market to fund the op\u0000on exercise; however, the restric\u0000ons do apply to (1) the sale of\nCompany stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of stock; (2) any other market sale for the purpose of\ngenera\u0000ng the cash needed to pay the exercise price of a stock op\u0000on; and (3) the subsequent sale of any Company\nstock obtained as a result of the exercise of a stock op\u0000on.\nPage 6 of 11\n• The purchase of common stock pursuant to the Company’s stock purchase plan; however, the restric\u0000ons do apply to\nthe elec\u0000on to par\u0000cipate or change the level of par\u0000cipa\u0000on in such plan; (2) voluntary purchases from addi\u0000onal\ncontribu\u0000ons to such plan; and (3) the sale of any common stock purchased through any such plan.\n• The exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which a recipient of an op\u0000on, stock grant, or other award under\none of the Company’s op\u0000on plans elects to have the Company withhold shares of the Company’s common stock to\nsa\u0000sfy tax withholding requirements.\n3.4.2 Event-Specific Blackout Periods\nThe Company may from \u0000me to \u0000me require selected directors and employees with access to material nonpublic informa\u0000on\nto refrain from trading during other specified periods when significant developments or announcements are an\u0000cipated (such\nas nego\u0000a\u0000on of a merger or acquisi\u0000on).\nThe Insider Trading Compliance Officer will no\u0000fy these select directors and employees when addi\u0000onal event-specific blackout\nperiods are in effect.\n3.4.3 Trading Pre-Clearance\nBefore a Restricted Person or any of their Related Persons trades in Company securi\u0000es that includes, but is not limited to, any\nsales in connec\u0000on with a cashless exercise of op\u0000ons on Company securi\u0000es, gi\u0000s, contribu\u0000ons to a trust or any other\ntransfers, the relevant Restricted Person must provide no\u0000ce to the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, CFO and Stock\nRepor\u0000ng in wri\u0000ng to confirm that a trading window is in effect and to obtain pre-clearance of the proposed trade. The\nwri\u0000en no\u0000ce must be in the form provided by the Insider Trading Compliance Officer from \u0000me to \u0000me and include without\nlimita\u0000on the requestor’s name, number of shares, proposed trade date range, and whether pre-clearance is requested for a\npurchase or a sale. Each wri\u0000en no\u0000ce must be submi\u0000ed at least two (2) full business days in advance of the proposed trade.\nThe Insider Trading Compliance Officer and CFO will no\u0000fy the requestor in wri\u0000ng if the proposed trade is cleared. The pre-\nclearance of a transac\u0000on will be valid for the shorter of the dates included in the approved pre-clearance no\u0000ce or the close of\nthe trading window. The Insider Trading Compliance Officer and CFO may delegate the SVP, Deputy General Counsel and\nCorporate Secretary and/or the SVP, Chief Accoun\u0000ng Officer to clear proposed trades pursuant to this sec\u0000on in their stead.\nEach proposed trade will be evaluated to determine if it raises insider trading concerns or other concerns under the federal or\nstate securi\u0000es laws and regula\u0000ons. Although the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, CFO or their delegate(s) may offer advice\nregarding the legal and regulatory aspects of a transac\u0000on, the Company’s failure to raise an objec\u0000on to a transac\u0000on will not\ncons\u0000tute a recommenda\u0000on that any person engage in such transac\u0000on, and the Company or the Insider Trading Compliance\nOfficer, CFO or their delegate(s) will not be liable in any manner regarding such advice.\nPage 7 of 11\nMembers of senior management are required to take steps to prevent persons under their supervision and/or control from\nusing informa\u0000on for trading purposes. If a member of the Company’s senior management becomes aware of an employee\nwho has access to material nonpublic informa\u0000on, he or she will recommend to the Insider Trading Compliance Officer and\nCFO that such employee be designated as a Restricted Person. Restricted Persons will be no\u0000fied of their status by the Insider\nTrading Compliance Officer, CFO or their delegate(s). Once such employee no longer has access to material nonpublic\ninforma\u0000on, the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, CFO or their delegate(s) will no\u0000fy such employee that their Restricted\nPerson status has been removed.\n3.4.4 Short-Swing Profits\nSec\u0000on 16 of the Exchange Act requires Sec\u0000on 16 Officers to return any profits made from the purchase and sale of Company\nsecuri\u0000es if both transac\u0000ons occur within a six (6) month period, regardless of whether there is a viola\u0000on of law or this\nPolicy. The rule was implemented to prevent insiders, who have greater access to material company informa\u0000on, from taking\nadvantage of informa\u0000on for the purpose of making short-term profits.\nSec\u0000on 16 compliance is the responsibility of each Sec\u0000on 16 Repor\u0000ng Person. However, the pre-clearance procedure may\nassist Sec\u0000on 16 Repor\u0000ng Persons in preven\u0000ng viola\u0000ons of the short-swing profits rule under Sec\u0000on 16(b).\nSec\u0000on 16 Repor\u0000ng Persons will face liability under Sec\u0000on 16(a) for any short-swing profits resul\u0000ng from a) a non-exempt\npurchase and sale or b) sale and purchase of Company securi\u0000es, occurring within a period of less than six (6) months. Such\npersons may be required to disgorge such profits to the Company.\nFor Sec\u0000on 16 purposes, neither the grant to, nor the exercise of, a stock op\u0000on to a Sec\u0000on 16 Repor\u0000ng Person is considered\nto be a purchase if the grant was approved by the Board or by a properly cons\u0000tuted compensa\u0000on commi\u0000ee. However, the\nsale of the common stock will be matched with any purchase occurring within a period of less than six (6) months prior to or\nfollowing the sale.\n3.4.5 SEC Rule 10b5-1\n3.4.5.1 Trading Plans\nRule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act was established by the SEC to allow insiders of publicly traded companies to set up a\ntrading plan for buying and selling stock of the company in which they are insiders. Rule 10b5-1 allows insiders to buy\nor sell a predetermined number of shares at a predetermined \u0000me to avoid poten\u0000al insider trading accusa\u0000ons.\nRestricted Persons may consider entering into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan for trading in the Company’s stock (a “Trading Plan”).\nA Trading Plan provides an affirma\u0000ve defense against insider trading liability if the Trading Plan was adopted in good\nPage 8 of 11\nfaith and when the Restricted Person was not in possession of material nonpublic informa\u0000on and otherwise complies\nwith the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, including that the Restricted Person has acted in good faith with respect to the\nTrading Plan from the \u0000me of adop\u0000on through the dura\u0000on of the Trading Plan.\n3.4.5.2 Guidelines\nRestricted Persons must submit a proposed Trading Plan to the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, CFO and Stock\nRepor\u0000ng for pre-clearance. This pre-clearance requirement applies to a proposed new Trading Plan and proposed\nmodifica\u0000ons to an exis\u0000ng Trading Plan.\nIf the Trading Plan meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and this Policy, it may be considered for pre-clearance by\nthe Insider Trading Compliance Officer and CFO. Each Trading Plan should be submi\u0000ed at least five (5) full business\ndays in advance of the proposed entry into, or modifica\u0000on of, the Trading Plan.\nOnce a Trading Plan is pre-cleared, Company securi\u0000es may be purchased or sold pursuant to such Trading Plan and\ntrades made pursuant to the Trading Plan will not require addi\u0000onal pre-clearance; however, Sec\u0000on 16 Repor\u0000ng\nPersons or Addi\u0000onal Restricted Employees are required to advise the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, CFO and\nStock Repor\u0000ng upon the execu\u0000on of a transac\u0000on so that appropriate SEC filings can be made \u0000mely.\nAddi\u0000onally, Restricted Persons are required to advise the Insider Trading Compliance Officer, CFO and Stock Repor\u0000ng\nof the termina\u0000on of a Trading Plan.\n3.4.5.3 Pre-Clearance Requirements\nPrior to entering into a Trading Plan, a Restricted Person must contact the Insider Trading Compliance Officer and CFO\nfor review of the proposed Trading Plan. A Trading Plan will not be approved if it does not meet the requirements of\nRule 10b5-1, which include a) specifying the dates, prices, and amounts of the contemplated trades, or b) establishing\na wri\u0000en formula or algorithm, or computer program, for determining dates, prices, and amounts. For directors and\nSec\u0000on 16 Officers, the Trading Plan must provide that purchases or sales under the Trading Plan will not commence\nun\u0000l the later of a) ninety (90) days following the date of the adop\u0000on of the Trading Plan, or b) two (2) business days\nfollowing the disclosure of the Company’s financial results in a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K for the completed fiscal quarter\nin which the Trading Plan was adopted; provided that, this cooling-off period is subject to a maximum of one hundred\ntwenty (120) days a\u0000er adop\u0000on of the Trading Plan. For all other Restricted Persons, the Trading Plan must provide\nthat purchases or sales under the Trading Plan will not commence un\u0000l thirty (30) days following the date of the\nadop\u0000on of the Trading Plan. The cooling-off periods described in the\nPage 9 of 11\nprevious sentences also apply to any modifica\u0000on of a Trading Plan, unless the modifica\u0000on does not change the\nprices, amounts of the contemplated trades or the \u0000ming of the contemplated trades, including due to changes in the\nformula, algorithm or computer program used to determine such prices, amounts, and dates.\nThe Trading Plan must also provide details regarding the broker administering the Trading Plan.\nA Restricted Person can only enter into or modify a Trading Plan during a trading window. At the \u0000me of entering into\nor modifying a Trading Plan, a Restricted Person will be required to cer\u0000fy to the Company, and the Company will need\nto reasonably believe, that such Restricted Person is entering into the Trading Plan in good faith and not as part of a\nplan or scheme to evade the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and is not aware of any material nonpublic informa\u0000on.\nThe Company will publicly disclose the adop\u0000on, modifica\u0000on or termina\u0000on of a Trading Plan during a fiscal quarter,\nas well as the material terms of the Trading Plan (including your name and \u0000tle, date of adop\u0000on, modifica\u0000on or\ntermina\u0000on of the Trading Plan, dura\u0000on of the Trading Plan, the aggregate number of securi\u0000es to be sold or\npurchased under the Trading Plan, and a descrip\u0000on of any modifica\u0000on of the Trading Plan) on an individualized basis\nin accordance with applicable securi\u0000es laws. The Company is also required to disclose certain wri\u0000en trading\narrangements that are not designed to sa\u0000sfy Rule 10b5-1.\n3.5 Viola\u0000on Consequences\nThe consequences of insider trading viola\u0000ons can be severe from both a legal and an employment perspec\u0000ve.\n3.5.1 Legal Consequences – Individual\nLegal consequences for any Company employee who trades inside informa\u0000on or provides \u0000p informa\u0000on to others, regardless\nof posi\u0000on, include:\n• Civil money penal\u0000es\n• Criminal fines\n• Incarcera\u0000on\n3.5.2 Consequences – Officers, Directors, and Employees\nIf the Company determines that an employee or director has violated this Policy, Company-imposed sanc\u0000ons, including\ndismissal or removal for cause, could result.\nThe Company believes it is important that its officers, directors, and its employees understand that any of the above\nconsequences -- even an SEC inves\u0000ga\u0000on that does not result in prosecu\u0000on -- can tarnish reputa\u0000ons and irreparably damage\npersonal careers.\nPage 10 of 11\n4. Policy Governance\nThe CLAO is responsible for this Policy. The Board of Directors must review and approve material changes to this Policy.\n4.1 Excep\u0000ons to Policy\nExcep\u0000ons to this Policy require Insider Trading Compliance Officer approval and execu\u0000ve management approval.\n5.
