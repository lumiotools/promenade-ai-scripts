The Fullerton facility is dedicated to producing next-generation, American-made, battery packs and modules, a critical component to the Company’s commitment to zero emissions and to reducing reliance on key battery components imported from foreign countries. Photos from Mullen’s Fullerton battery facility can be found at [MullenUSA.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=v34xl2-HhMu3mWcfmSSocCfXlGpml-kp0BXDizH1WiFrhM2fzmUxfnNTlQPS0whi0kEdInIYEQHOwgQYxSrG6Y3SuZCwQB06qR5Bvc-HpL635zmJwALCnyi0EX5_kSFni8-n3LK0eYOTMmdFyv9OUg== \"MullenUSA.com\").\n\n“A key mission for our company is to transition to American-made battery components,” said David Michery, CEO and chairman of Mullen Automotive. “Our focus is on producing batteries and modules made right here in the USA.”\n\nMullen’s Focus is on American-Made Battery Production\n\n![mullens-focus-is-on-american-made-battery-production](https://news.mullenusa.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mullens-focus-is-on-american-made-battery-production.jpg?width=670&height=447&name=mullens-focus-is-on-american-made-battery-production.jpg)\n\nFullerton, California, facility anticipates starting production in mid-2025.\n\n**About Mullen**\n\nMullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) is a Southern California-based automotive company building the next generation of commercial electric vehicles (“EVs”) with two United States-based vehicle plants located in Tunica, Mississippi, (120,000 square feet) and Mishawaka, Indiana (650,000 square feet). In August 2023, Mullen began commercial vehicle production in Tunica. In September 2023, Mullen received IRS approval for federal EV tax credits on its commercial vehicles with a Qualified Manufacturer designation that offers eligible customers up to $7,500 per vehicle. As of January 2024, both the Mullen ONE, a Class 1 EV cargo van, and Mullen THREE, a Class 3 EV cab chassis truck, are California Air Resource Board (“CARB”) and EPA certified and available for sale in the U.S. Recently, CARB issued HVIP approval on the Mullen THREE, Class 3 EV truck, providing up to $45,000 cash voucher at time of vehicle purchase. The Company has also recently expanded its commercial dealer network to seven dealers with the addition of Papé Kenworth. Other previously announced dealers include Pritchard EV, National Auto Fleet Group, Ziegler Truck Group, Range Truck Group, Eco Auto, and Randy Marion Auto Group, providing sales and service coverage in key Midwest, West Coast, Pacific Northwest, New England and Mid-Atlantic markets. The Company has also announced Foreign Trade Zone (“FTZ”) status approval for its Tunica, Mississippi, commercial vehicle manufacturing center. FTZ approval provides a number of benefits, including deferment of duties owed and elimination of duties on exported vehicles.\n\nTo learn more about the Company, visit[www.MullenUSA.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DOFoknSgFmGTlkweylnShTAuc-BpZhb1iWoYS78f3EdCEC-m0wquFaTTeAAZ_MBZ3dPhlY_OBcmVYG3Di-hIUH44gP8s9aULcDqDtvuubTo= \"www.MullenUSA.com\").\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Any statements contained in this press release that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Words such as “continue,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “expected,” “plans,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, many of which are generally outside the control of Mullen and are difficult to predict. Examples of such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, whether the anticipated start of battery production date will be achieved; if and when the two additional battery lines planned for the Fullerton Facility will materialize; and whether anticipated timing for installation of the high volume standard chemistry battery line and high volume automated wire bonding line will be realized. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements can be found in the most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed by Mullen with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mullen anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its plans, intentions and expectations to change. Mullen assumes no obligation, and it specifically disclaims any intention or obligation, to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by law. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and should not be relied upon as representing Mullen’s plans and expectations as of any subsequent date.\n\n**Contact** :Mullen Automotive, Inc.+1 (714) 613-1900[ _www.MullenUSA.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zkQOoJnMlgOAJyadA_bXOPPyGzcKDNvyJveasaERnl6MKKQ5qEmjAqwwsqey0ZKg5Jrs_Ff_i-3D1Nw0XM42SWJ1vardSzy1P4OkW7TQcs0=)\n\n**Corporate Communications:** InvestorBrandNetwork (IBN)Los Angeles, California[ _www.InvestorBrandNetwork.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YfAc7sbDPPsjV6uKgQiuhC60aFD3Kp3Db2A7IkAmuNdrjgR1RbBUGFpwJ80pULW2QlPrKcDN5GBCkJJkwuY5ayKfGh0Sls9lXM6PdzWaV9jrfxXJxG3HzhChmW8Ol-gL)310.299.1717 Office[ _Editor@InvestorBrandNetwork.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oa93CpjdcJAaZjb27KbehkOQJf7j-wgZdqvHs8Rs-p9HXurHzHZkiplQFbTcO7YOPmtFEv0Bmo84bI_GZQsQ5AH9na0wfJIMKBFBvgStklhOFzd4n7yrwn56uyKkHOg3)\n\n![Mullen](https://news.mullenusa.com/hubfs/mullen-4-0/icon/green-logo.svg)\n\nStay Connected: Be the First to Hear About All Things Mullen Automotive \n\nBy clicking submit below, you declare that you accept the [Privacy Policy](https://www.mullenusa.com/privacy-policy) and consent to Mullen Automotive contacting you. \n\n[ ![](https://news.mullenusa.com/hubfs/mullen-4-0/promotional/captha.png) ](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)\n\n[ Connect ](https://www.mullenusa.com/connect) [ Invest ](https://investors.mullenusa.com/)\n\n[ Manufacturing ](https://www.mullenusa.com/manufacturing)\n\n[ About ](https://www.mullenusa.com/about-us) [ Team ](https://www.mullenusa.com/our-team) [ Newsroom ](https://news.mullenusa.com/tag/press-release)\n\n[ Contact ](https://www.mullenusa.com/contact-us)\n\n[ ![facebook](https://news.mullenusa.com/hubfs/mullen-4-0/icon/Facebook.svg) ](https://www.facebook.com/MullenUSA) [ ![twitter](https://news.mullenusa.com/hubfs/mullen-4-0/icon/Twitter.svg) ](https://twitter.com/Mullen_USA) [ ![instagram](https://news.mullenusa.com/hubfs/mullen-4-0/icon/Instagram.svg) ](https://www.instagram.com/mullenusa/) [ ![linkedin](https://news.mullenusa.com/hubfs/mullen-4-0/icon/LinkedIn.svg) ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mullenusa) [ ![youtube](https://news.mullenusa.com/hubfs/mullen-4-0/icon/Youtube.svg) ](https://www.youtube.com/@MullenAutomotive)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://www.mullenusa.com/terms-of-use) | [Privacy Policy](https://www.mullenusa.com/privacy-policy)\n\nCopyright © 2024 Mullen Automotive, Inc.All Rights Reserved. \n\n![Mullen](https://news.mullenusa.com/hubfs/mullen-4-0/icon/chevron-down.svg)\n"
