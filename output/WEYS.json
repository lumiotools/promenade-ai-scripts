The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has recommended, and the\nBoard of Directors has approved, the following nominees for reelection: Tina Chang, Robert Feitler, John W. Florsheim, Thomas W. Florsheim, Thomas\nW. Florsheim, Jr., Cory L. Nettles, and Frederick P. Stratton, Jr.\nA majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of our common stock, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a\nquorum at the Annual Meeting. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of our common stock at a meeting at which a quorum\nis present. “Plurality” means that the individuals who receive the largest number of votes cast are elected as directors up to the maximum number of\ndirectors to be chosen at the meeting. Consequently, any shares not voted (whether by abstention, broker nonvote or otherwise) have no impact in the\nelection of directors except to the extent the failure to vote for an individual results in another individual receiving a comparatively larger number of\nvotes. Votes “against” a candidate are given no legal effect and are not counted as votes cast in an election of directors. Votes will be tabulated by an\ninspector at the meeting.\nIf any of the nominees should decline or be unable to act as a director, which is not expected, the proxies will be voted with discretionary authority\nby the persons named to vote in the proxy for a substitute nominee designated by the Board of Directors.\nThomas W. Florsheim, Jr. and John W. Florsheim are brothers, and their father is Thomas W. Florsheim. There are no other family relationships\nbetween any of our directors.\nThe Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the election of\nTina Chang, Robert Feitler, John W. Florsheim, Thomas W. Florsheim, Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr.,\nCory L. Nettles, and Frederick P. Stratton, Jr.\nInformation regarding the nominees, including the particular skills, qualifications and other attributes that we believe qualify each to serve on our\nBoard, is set forth below as well as in “Board Information — Composition of the Board of Directors.” For additional information regarding the criteria\nto evaluate Board membership, see “Board Information — Nomination of Director Candidates” below.\nNominees for Election for Terms Expiring in 2025\nTina Chang, Director since 2007\nChairman of Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nMember of Audit Committee and Compensation Committee\nSince 1996, Tina has served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of SysLogic, Inc.

The Audit Committee appointed them as our independent registered public\naccounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024.

Representatives of Baker Tilly US, LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement\nif they so desire and to be available to respond to appropriate questions.\nAlthough not required by law to submit the appointment to a vote by shareholders, the Audit Committee and the Board believe it is appropriate, as a\nmatter of policy, to request that the shareholders ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for 2024.\n6\nTable of Contents\nIf the appointment is not ratified, the adverse vote will be considered as an indication to the Audit Committee that it should consider selecting\nanother independent registered public accounting firm for the following year.

Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect this vote,\nexcept insofar as they reduce the number of shares that are voted.\nThe Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of\nBaker Tilly US, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm\nfor the year ending December 31, 2024.\nProposal Three: Approval of the Weyco Group, Inc. 2024 Incentive Plan\nIn March 2024, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, the adoption of the Weyco Group, Inc. 2024\nIncentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”), subject to approval of the shareholders at the 2024 annual meeting.\nThe purposes of the 2024 Plan are to provide a means to attract and retain talented personnel and to provide to participating directors, officers, and\nother salaried employees long-term incentives for high levels of performance and for successful efforts to improve the financial performance of the\nCompany. The 2024 Plan permits the grant of options to purchase common stock of the Company, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance\nshares and cash incentive awards. For purposes of the 2024 Plan, “restricted stock” means shares of common stock that are subject to restrictions\nestablished by the Committee (as defined below). A “restricted stock unit” means an award granted to an individual to issue shares of common stock in\nthe future if specific conditions established by the Committee are satisfied. In the case of an award of “performance shares,” the Committee sets\nperformance goals in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met over the performance period, will determine the number of\nperformance shares ultimately paid out to the grantee in the form of shares of common stock. A \"cash incentive award\" means a grant agreeing to make\na cash payment to an individual if specific performance goals established by the Committee are achieved.\nThe common stock awards under the 2024 Plan are limited to a maximum of 1,500,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate, subject to\nappropriate adjustments in the event the Company, among other things, declares a stock dividend, stock split, or similar change affecting the common\nstock. For example, if performance shares are issued with respect to 700,000 shares of common stock, then only 800,000 shares will remain available\nfor the purpose of making other awards under the 2024 Plan. If any award granted under the 2024 Plan is canceled, terminates, expires or lapses for any\nreason, any shares subject to such award will again be available for the grant of an award under the 2024 Plan. The following description of the 2024\nPlan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text set forth in Appendix A.\nVote Required for Plan\nThe 2024 Plan is being submitted to the shareholders for approval in order to satisfy applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)\nand NASDAQ Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) requirements. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share with respect to the approval of the\n2024 Plan. Assuming a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, the 2024 Plan will be approved if the votes at the Annual Meeting by the holders of\nshares of common stock entitled to vote voting for the 2024 Plan exceed those voting against it. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the\noutcome of this proposal, except insofar as they reduce the number of shares that are voted. No options or awards have yet been granted under the 2024\nPlan and the 2024 Plan will not become effective if it is not approved by shareholders.\nIf the 2024 Plan is approved by shareholders, no further awards will be granted under the Weyco Group, Inc. 2017 Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”).\n7\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Features of the Incentive Plan\nThe 2024 Plan will be administered by a Committee designated by the Company’s Board of Directors and constituted to permit the 2024 Plan to\ncomply with applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or any successor rule) and Section 409A of the Code. It is\nintended that at all times the Committee will be comprised solely of directors who are non-employee directors, as defined in Rule 16b-3. The Committee\nwill initially be the Compensation Committee of the Board. Options may be granted to non-employee directors (currently five individuals), officers\n(currently twelve individuals) and salaried employees of the Company and any of its subsidiaries (currently approximately 120 individuals), in the\ndiscretion of the Committee and using criteria it determines from time to time. However, no individual may receive grants covering, in the aggregate,\nmore than 90,000 shares in any calendar year, including options, grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares.\nOptions may be incentive stock options (“ISOs”) or non-qualified stock options (“NSOs”); provided, however, that ISOs will only be granted to\nindividuals who are employed by the Company or a parent or a subsidiary corporation of the Company. The exercise price for any option will not be\nless than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided that employees owning more than 10% of the voting power of all\nclasses of Company stock are ineligible to receive ISOs unless the exercise price is at least 110% of the fair market value on the date the option is\ngranted and the option expires no later than five years after it is granted. The exercise price may be paid in cash or (if approved by the Committee) by\nsurrendering to the Company shares of common stock otherwise issuable upon exercise of an option or in shares of common stock beneficially owned\nfor at least 6 months at the time of exercise by the optionee or the optionee’s spouse or both. The fair market value on the date of an option grant of\nshares with respect to which ISOs are first exercisable during any calendar year will not exceed $100,000.\nEach option granted under the 2024 Plan will be evidenced by a stock option agreement containing the terms and conditions required by the 2024\nPlan and such other terms as the Committee may deem appropriate in each case. Each stock option agreement will state the period or periods of time\nwithin which an option may be exercised, as determined by the Committee. No option may be exercised more than ten years from the date of grant.\nUnless otherwise specified by the Committee, no option granted under the 2024 Plan will be transferable or assignable except by last will and testament\nor the laws of descent and distribution. During the optionee’s lifetime, options will be exercisable only by the optionee or by the optionee’s guardian or\npersonal representative.\nShares of restricted stock or restricted stock units may be issued either alone or in addition to other awards granted under the 2024 Plan. The\nCommittee determines the individuals to whom and the times at which grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units will be made, the number of\nshares to be awarded, the time or times within which such awards may be subject to forfeiture or the conditions upon which shares of common stock\nmay be granted, and any other terms and conditions of the awards. Such grants may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance goals\nor other criteria determined by the Committee, and the provisions of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards need not be the same with\nrespect to each recipient. The specified performance goals are based on the attainment of goals relating to one or more of the following business criteria\nmeasured on an absolute basis or in terms of growth or reduction: net income (pre-tax or after-tax and with adjustments as stipulated), earnings per\nshare, return on equity, return on capital employed, return on assets, return on tangible book value, operating income, earnings before depreciation,\ninterest, taxes and amortization (“EBDITA”), loss ratio, expense ratio, increase in stock price, total shareholder return, economic value added, and\noperating cash flow.\nShares of restricted stock will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 14 of the 2024 Plan. Until the applicable restrictions lapse,\na grantee will not be permitted to transfer or encumber shares of restricted stock, but will have the right to vote the shares. Any cash dividends on shares\nof restricted stock will be accumulated by the Company and paid when and if the shares vest; provided that the Committee may elect to pay cash\ndividends on unvested shares currently. Any dividends payable in stock will be paid in the form of additional shares of restricted stock. A grantee of an\naward of restricted stock units, by contrast, will not be deemed the holder of any shares of common stock covered by the award, and will not have any\nrights as a shareholder with respect thereto, until the underlying shares of common stock are issued to him or her. Unless otherwise provided in the\napplicable restricted stock agreement, all shares still subject to restriction will be forfeited upon termination of a grantee’s employment for any reason\nunless the Committee determines to waive such restrictions in the event of hardship or other special circumstances of a grantee whose employment is\nterminated (other than for cause).\n8\nTable of Contents\nAwards of performance shares may also be made under the 2024 Plan to directors, officers, and salaried employees at any time and from time to\ntime. Each performance share has an initial value equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. The Committee is\nauthorized to set performance goals in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met during a specified performance period, will\ndetermine the number of performance shares that will be paid out to grantees. After the applicable performance period has ended, the grantee is entitled\nto receive a payout based on the number of performance shares earned over the performance period, to be determined as a function of the extent to\nwhich the corresponding performance goals have been achieved. The payout is required to be made in a single lump sum within 45 days following the\nclose of the performance period, in the form of shares of common stock. Performance shares may not be sold, pledged, or transferred, other than by will\nor by the laws of descent and distribution, and may be exercised during the grantee’s lifetime only by the grantee or the grantee’s legal representative.\nCash incentive awards may be made under the 2024 Plan to officers and salaried employees at any time and from time to time. The Committee is\nauthorized to set performance goals in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met during a specified performance period, will\ndetermine the amount paid to employees. The maximum cash incentive award payable to an employee in any fiscal year may not exceed $1 million.\nIf the Company is dissolved or liquidated, or in the event of a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or a\nsale or exchange of substantially all of the assets of the Company for cash or securities of another corporation, all equity awards will be deemed fully\nvested, exercised and/or payable, as the case may be, and in lieu of any other transfer of shares, cash or other property, grantees will receive an amount\nof cash equal to the amount which would otherwise have been attained as a result of such deemed vesting, exercise and/or payment event. In the event\nof a change of control as defined in the 2024 Plan, all equity awards will become immediately vested.\nAwards may be granted under the 2024 Plan at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the date that the 2024 Plan is approved by the Company’s\nshareholders. On that date, the 2024 Plan will expire, except as to awards then outstanding, which will remain in effect until the options have been\nexercised, the restrictions on restricted stock have lapsed or the awards have expired or have been forfeited. No awards are expected to be granted\npursuant to the 2024 Plan before the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and no allocations have been made to any person or group of persons. The\n2024 Plan may be terminated at any time by the Board of Directors except with respect to any awards then outstanding. The Board of Directors may\namend the 2024 Plan from time to time, but no such amendment may impair without the grantee’s consent any previously granted award or deprive any\ngrantee of any shares of stock acquired through the 2024 Plan, or be made without shareholder approval where such approval would be required as a\ncondition of compliance with Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nCertain Federal Income Tax Consequences of the 2024 Plan\nThe following is a brief summary of the Company’s understanding of the principal income tax consequences under the Code of grants or awards\nmade under the 2024 Plan based upon the applicable provisions of the Code in effect on the date hereof.\nNonqualified Stock Options. An optionee will not recognize taxable income at the time an NSO is granted. Upon exercise of the NSO, an\noptionee will recognize compensation income in an amount equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on\nthe date of exercise. The amount of such difference will be a deductible expense to the Company for tax purposes. On a subsequent sale or exchange of\nshares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an NSO, the optionee will recognize a taxable gain or loss, measured by the difference between the amount\nrealized on the disposition and the tax basis of such shares. The tax basis will, in general, be the amount paid for the shares plus the amount treated as\ncompensation income at the time the shares were acquired pursuant to the exercise of the option.\nWhen the NSO exercise price is paid in delivered stock, the exercise is treated as: (a) a tax-free exchange of the shares of delivered stock (without\nrecognition of any taxable gain with respect thereto) for a like number of new shares (with such new shares having the same basis and holding period as\nthe old); and (b) an issuance of a number of additional shares having a fair market value equal to the “spread” between the exercise price and the fair\nmarket value of the shares for which the NSO is exercised. The optionee’s basis in the additional shares will equal the amount of compensation income\n9\nTable of Contents\nrecognized upon exercise of the NSO and the holding period for such shares will begin on the day the optionee acquires them. This mode of payment\ndoes not affect the ordinary income tax liability incurred upon exercise of the NSO described above.\nIncentive Stock Options. An optionee will not recognize taxable income at the time an ISO is granted. Further, an optionee will not recognize\ntaxable income upon exercise of an ISO if the optionee complies with two separate holding periods: shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO must be\nheld for at least two years after the date of grant and for at least one year after the date of exercise. However, the difference between the exercise price\nand the fair market value of the stock at the date of exercise will constitute an item includible in alternative minimum taxable income, and thereby may\nsubject the optionee to the alternative minimum tax. When the shares of stock received pursuant to the exercise of an ISO are sold or otherwise\ndisposed of in a taxable transaction, the optionee will recognize a capital gain or loss, measured by the difference between the exercise price and the\namount realized.\nOrdinarily, an employer granting ISOs will not be allowed any business expense deduction with respect to stock issued upon exercise of an ISO.\nHowever, if all the requirements for an ISO are met except for the holding period rules set forth above, the optionee will be required, at the time of the\ndisposition of the stock, to treat the lesser of the gain realized or the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock at the\ndate of exercise as ordinary income and the excess, if any, as long-term or short-term capital gain, depending upon the holding period of the shares. (If\nthe amount realized upon such disposition is less than the exercise price, the loss will be treated as long-term or short-term capital loss, depending upon\nthe holding period of the shares.) The Company will be allowed a corresponding business expense deduction to the extent of the amount of the\noptionee’s ordinary income.\nRestricted Stock. A grantee receiving a restricted stock award will generally recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market\nvalue of the stock at the time the stock is no longer subject to forfeiture. While the restrictions are in effect, the grantee will recognize compensation\nincome equal to the amount of any dividends received and the Company will be allowed a deduction for that amount. A grantee may elect, under\nSection 83(b) of the Code, within 30 days of the stock grant to recognize taxable ordinary income on the date of grant equal to the excess of the fair\nmarket value of the shares (determined without regard to the restrictions) on such date over the amount, if any, paid for such shares. The Company will\ngenerally be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount that is taxable as ordinary income to the grantee in the year that such income is taxable.\nThe holding period to determine whether the grantee has long-term or short-term capital gain or loss on a subsequent sale of the stock generally\nbegins when the restriction period expires and the tax basis for such shares will generally be based on the fair market value of the shares on such date.\nHowever, if the grantee has made an election under Section 83(b), the holding period will commence on the date of grant and the tax basis will be equal\nto the fair market value of shares on such date (determined without regard to the restrictions).\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Shares. An individual who has been granted restricted stock units or performance shares will not\nrecognize taxable income until the applicable award cycle expires and the individual is in receipt of the stock distributed in payment of the award, at\nwhich time such individual will realize compensation income equal to the full fair market value of the shares delivered. The Company is generally\nentitled to an income tax deduction for any compensation income taxed to the grantee.\nCash Incentive Awards. An individual who receives a cash incentive award will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of cash paid, and\nthe Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction in the same amount and at the same time.\nNew Plan Benefits\nLike the 2017 Plan, awards to participants under the 2024 Plan are determined by the Committee in its discretion. As a result, it is not possible to\ndetermine the benefits and amounts that will be received by any individual participant or group of participants in the future. Because the 2024 Plan has\nnot yet been approved, there are no historical data to report. If the 2024 Plan had been in place over the prior fiscal year, awards to participants would\nhave been substantially similar to those awarded under the 2017 Plan. The option and restricted share grants shown in the table below were made during\nthe Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, pursuant to the Weyco Group, Inc. 2017 Incentive Plan for (i) our\n10\nTable of Contents\nexecutive officers, (ii) the Company’s non-employee directors (in aggregate), and (iii) the Company’s employees who are not executive officers (in\naggregate).\nName and Position Dollar Value ($) Number of Units\n(1)\nOptions Restricted Stock\nThomas W.

The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amending the\napplicable provision of the Bylaws, but no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of an incumbent director.\nDirectors Skills and Diversity Matrix\nThe matrix below summarizes, as of April 5, 2024, certain key skills, experiences, qualifications, and attributes that our directors and director\nnominees bring to the Board to enable effective oversight. This matrix is intended to provide a summary of the directors’ qualifications and is not a\ncomplete list of each director’s strengths or contributions to the Board. Additional details on each director’s skills, experiences, qualifications, and\nattributes are set forth in their biographies.\nTina Robert John W. Thomas W. Thomas W. Cory L.

The skills and experience\ncategories in the table above are more fully described as follows:\nAttributes and Experience of Director / Director Nominees\nExecutive Leadership Directors who have served as a founder, CEO or CEO-equivalent, COO, senior executive or business unit\nleader of a company with a deep understanding of company offerings and industry\nBusiness Development & Strategy Directors with experience in strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, growth strategies or business\nexpansion\nTechnology / Cybersecurity Directors with extensive experience in software products, services, engineering or development, computer\nscience, information technology, cybersecurity or technology research and development\nSales, Marketing & Brand Directors with specific and extensive career experience focusing on sales management, marketing campaign\nManagement management, marketing/advertising products and services or public relations\nFinance or Accounting Directors with a deep understanding of finance, accounting principles and methodologies, financial reporting,\nfinancial management, capital markets, financial statements, audit processes and procedures or internal\ncontrols\nLegal or Regulatory Directors with governmental policy, legal knowledge or experience with compliance and regulatory issues\nwithin a public company or a regulatory body, including any individual who has a CPA, JD, or significant\nCFO experience\nOperations Directors having expertise in business operations management, supply chain management, integration or\ndistribution\nPublic Company Board Service Directors who currently serve, or have served, on other public company boards\nMeetings\nThe Board of Directors held four meetings during 2023. All members of the Board of Directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the\nnumber of meetings of the Board and each committee of the Board on which they served. Our policy is that all directors should attend the Annual\nMeeting of Shareholders. All Board members attended the Annual Meeting held on May 2, 2023. In accordance with Nasdaq rules, our independent\ndirectors have periodic meetings at which only independent directors are present.\nDirector Independence\nEach year, the Board reviews the relationships that each director has with the Company. Only those directors who the Board affirmatively\ndetermines have no relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, and\nwho do not have any of the categorical relationships that preclude a determination of independence under the Nasdaq listing standards, are considered to\nbe independent directors.\nIn accordance with the applicable Nasdaq rules, the Board has determined that the following directors qualify as independent directors: Tina Chang,\nRobert Feitler, Cory L. Nettles, and Frederick P. Stratton, Jr. The Board concluded that none of these directors possessed the categorical relationships set\nforth in the Nasdaq standards that preclude a determination of independence, and that none of them has any other relationship that the Board believes\nwould interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Nominating and\n13\nTable of Contents\nCorporate Governance Committee, Compensation Committee, and Audit Committee are comprised solely of directors who have been determined to be\nindependent.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nWe combine the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Our management and Board of Directors currently\nbelieve that the Chief Executive Officer’s direct involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Company makes him best positioned to lead Board\ndiscussions of our short-term and long-term objectives and helps ensure proper oversight of the Company’s risks. Additionally, our Board structure\nprovides oversight by our independent directors. As previously disclosed, the independent directors meet periodically without any members of\nmanagement present. In addition, each of the Board’s standing committees is chaired by an independent director and is comprised solely of directors\nwho are independent. The Board has not appointed an independent lead director.\nOur Board of Directors plays a role in the oversight of risks that could potentially affect the Company, including risks related to cybersecurity and\ndata security. The Board’s Audit Committee fulfills the formal responsibility of financial risk oversight as disclosed in its charter, which is available on\nour website. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management to review our major financial risk exposures and the steps management has\ntaken to monitor and control such exposures. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for the evaluation of risk as it relates\nto corporate governance, and the Compensation Committee is responsible for the evaluation of risks related compensation matters.\nShareholder Communications with the Board\nShareholders wishing to communicate with the Board of Directors or with a particular Board member should address communications to the Board\nor to a particular Board member, c/o Secretary, Weyco Group, Inc., 333 West Estabrook Boulevard, Glendale, Wisconsin 53212. All communications\naddressed to the Board or to a particular director or committee will be relayed to that addressee. From time to time, the Board may change the process\nthrough which shareholders communicate with the Board. Please refer to our website at www.weycogroup.com for changes in this process.\nNomination of Director Candidates\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has established the following Guidelines and Criteria for Nomination of Director\nCandidates:\n● The Committee will review each candidate’s qualifications in light of the needs of the Board and the Company, considering the current mix of\ndirector attributes and other pertinent factors (specific qualities, skills and professional experience required will vary depending on the\nCompany’s specific needs at any point in time).\n● The Committee will consider the diversity of the existing Board, so that the Board maintains a body of directors from diverse professional and\npersonal backgrounds.\n● There will be no differences in the manner in which the Committee evaluates candidates recommended by shareholders and candidates\nidentified from other sources.\n● Any nominee should be an individual of the highest character and integrity and have an inquiring mind, vision and the ability to work well\nwith others.\n● Any nominee should be free of any conflict of interest which would violate any applicable law or regulation or interfere with the proper\nperformance of the responsibilities of a director.\n● Any nominee should possess substantial and significant experience which would be of value to the Company in the performance of the duties\nof a director.\n14\nTable of Contents\n● Any nominee should have sufficient time available to devote to the affairs of the Company in order to carry out the responsibilities of a\ndirector.\n● To recommend a candidate, shareholders should write to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Weyco Group, Inc., 333 West\nEstabrook Boulevard, Glendale, Wisconsin 53212, via certified mail. The written recommendation should include the candidate’s name and\naddress, a brief biographical description and statement of qualifications of the candidate and the candidate’s signed consent to be named in the\nProxy Statement and to serve as a director if elected.\n● To be considered by the Committee for nomination and inclusion in our Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting, the Committee must\nreceive shareholder recommendations for directors no later than December 2, 2024.\nFrom time to time, the Board may change the process through which shareholders may recommend director candidates to the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee. The Company has not received any shareholder recommendations for director candidates with regard to the election\nof directors covered by this Proxy Statement or otherwise.\nCommittees\nOur Board of Directors formerly had three standing committees: the Executive Committee, the Corporate Governance and Compensation\nCommittee and the Audit Committee. However, in March 2024, in connection with its regular review of the committees and related charters, the Board\nof Directors elected to dissolve the Executive Committee and split the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee into two separate\ncommittees. Therefore, effective March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors has the following three standing committees: the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Audit Committee. Duties and responsibilities of the former Executive Committee will\nbe delegated to these three standing committees going forward.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nWe are committed to conducting our business with the highest standards of business ethics and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and\nregulations, including the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq on which our common stock is traded. In addition to Nasdaq rules and applicable governmental\nlaws and regulations, the framework for our corporate governance is provided by: (a) our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; (b) the charters of our\nboard committees; and (c) our Code of Business Ethics.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for various matters related to corporate and board governance. The principal\nfunctions of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are: (1) to assist the Board by identifying individuals qualified to become members\nof the Board and its Committees, and to recommend to the Board the director nominees for the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders; (2) to recommend\nto the Board the corporate governance guidelines applicable to the Company, including changes to those guidelines as appropriate from time to time;\n(3) to lead the Board in its periodic reviews of the Board’s performance; and (4) to communicate to shareholders regarding these policies and activities\nas required by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter and the Guidelines and Criteria for\nNomination of Director Candidates are available on our website at weycogroup.com.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also reviews the procedures, the effectiveness and the performance of the Board as a whole,\nthe individual directors and the Board committees, as well as its own performance. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the members of\nthe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (Tina Chang, Robert Feitler, Cory L. Nettles and Frederick P. Stratton, Jr.) is independent, as\ndefined in the current listing standards of Nasdaq and the SEC rules relating to such committees. There were no meetings of the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee in 2023, as such committee was newly formed on March 5, 2024. There were four meetings of the former Corporate\nGovernance and Compensation Committee held in 2023.\n15\nTable of Contents\nCode of Business Ethics\nOur Code of Business Ethics sets forth ethical obligations for all employees, officers and directors, including those that apply specifically to\ndirectors and executive officers, such as accounting and financial reporting matters. Any waiver of the Code of Business Ethics requires approval of the\nBoard of Directors or of a committee of the Board. Our Code of Business Ethics is available on our website at weycogroup.com. If any substantive\namendment is made to the Code, the nature of the amendment will be disclosed on our website or in a current report on Form 8-K. In addition, if a\nwaiver from the Code is granted to an executive officer or director, the nature of the waiver will be disclosed in a current report on Form 8-K.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for matters involving compensation of the Company’s non-employee directors and executive officers.\nThe principal functions of the Compensation Committee are: (1) to establish, subject to approval of the full Board, compensation arrangements for our\nexecutive officers; (2) to administer our equity incentive and other compensation plans, and approve the granting of equity awards to our officers and\nother key employees; and (3) to communicate to shareholders regarding these policies and activities as required by the SEC and other regulatory bodies.\nThe Compensation Committee also establishes compensation arrangements for senior management and administers the granting of stock-based\nawards to our officers and other key employees. The charter of the Compensation Committee is available on our website at weycogroup.com. The Board\nof Directors has determined that each of the members of the Compensation Committee (Tina Chang, Robert Feitler, Cory L. Nettles and Frederick P.\nStratton, Jr.) is independent, as defined in the current listing standards of Nasdaq and the SEC rules relating to such committees. There were no\nmeetings of the Compensation Committee in 2023, as such committee was newly formed on March 5, 2024. There were four meetings of the former\nCorporate Governance and Compensation Committee held in 2023.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for providing independent oversight of our financial statements, internal controls, and\nthe financial reporting process, as well as the annual independent audit of our financial statements. A copy of the charter of the Audit Committee is\navailable on our website at weycogroup.com. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee (Frederick P.\nStratton, Jr., Tina Chang, Robert Feitler, and Cory L. Nettles) is independent, as defined in the current listing standards of Nasdaq and SEC rules relating\nto audit committees. This means that, except in their roles as members of the Board of Directors and its committees, they are not affiliates of the\nCompany, they receive no consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees directly or indirectly from the Company, they have no other relationships\nwith the Company that may interfere with the exercise of their independence from management and the Company, and they have not participated in the\npreparation of the financial statements of the Company or any of our current subsidiaries at any time during the past three years. In addition, the Board\nof Directors has determined that each Audit Committee member satisfies the financial literacy requirements of Nasdaq and that Robert Feitler and\nFrederick P. Stratton, Jr. each qualify as “audit committee financial experts” within the meaning of applicable rules of the SEC.\nManagement has primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. In\nfulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Committee reviewed our audited financial statements with management, including a discussion of the quality,\nnot just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial\nstatements. The Committee also discussed and reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm all communications required under\ngenerally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), and SEC rules. In addition,\nthe independent registered public accounting firm provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures required by PCAOB rules concerning\nindependence. The Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm their independence from management and the\nCompany and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe Committee discussed with our independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plan for their audit. The Committee meets\nwith the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examination, their\nevaluation of our internal controls, and the overall quality of our financial reporting. The Committee held four meetings during 2023.\nPre-Approval Policy\nThe Audit Committee has responsibility for recommending appointment of, setting compensation for, and overseeing the work of the independent\nregistered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee must approve in advance the audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by, and the\nfees to be paid to, the independent auditor, subject to the de minimis exceptions to pre-approval permitted by the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq for non-\naudit services. No fees were paid during 2023 to the independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the de minimis exception to the\nforegoing pre-approval policy.\nReport of Audit Committee\nIn connection with its function to oversee and monitor the financial reporting process of the Company, the Audit Committee has done the following\n(among other things):\n● reviewed and discussed with management our audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023;\n● discussed with Baker Tilly US, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by the PCAOB\nand SEC;\n● received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Baker Tilly US, LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB\nregarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and have\ndiscussed with them their independence; and\n● concluded that Baker Tilly US LLP’s provision of audit and non-audit services to the Company is compatible with their independence.\nBased on the foregoing, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFrederick P. Stratton, Jr., Chairman\nTina Chang\nRobert Feitler\nCory L. Nettles\nAudit and Non-Audit Fees\nThe Audit Committee also reviewed the fees and scope of services provided to the Company by our independent registered public accounting firm\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

However, we strongly discourage directors,\nofficers and employees from engaging in such transactions, and, to our knowledge, no hedging transactions involving Company securities have been\nentered into by these individuals.\nDirector Compensation\nOur directors who are not also employees receive a quarterly cash retainer. The quarterly cash retainer was $9,000 in 2023. Non-employee directors\nare also eligible to receive equity awards. In 2023, each non-employee director received 1,000 shares of restricted stock and options to purchase 3,500\nshares of common stock under the Weyco Group, Inc. 2017 Incentive Plan.

No benefits have been accrued under the plan\nsubsequent to that date. The Company also has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for key executives so they may receive pension benefits which\nthey would otherwise be prevented from receiving as a result of certain limitations of the Internal Revenue Code. Normal retirement benefits generally\nequal one and six-tenths of an employee’s average annual compensation multiplied by number of years of credited service, up to a maximum of\n25 years. The plans provide for normal retirement at age 65 and provide for reduced benefits for early retirement beginning at age 55. Pension benefits\nare payable under a variety of options, to be selected by the retiree and are calculated under a formula that is integrated with Social Security, although\nthe amounts determined under the formula are not reduced by Social Security benefits. Benefits under the supplemental plan are payable either in the\nform of an annuity or as a single lump-sum payment following the retiree’s termination of service. The normal retirement benefit is 1.6% of average\ncompensation per year and is based on (i) the highest average earnings for any 5 consecutive years during the 10 calendar years ending December 31,\n2016, (ii) length of service up to 25 years and (iii) the highest average covered compensation for Social Security purposes.\nThe foregoing describes the general formula under the defined benefit plan and related excess benefits plan as revised in 1997. Those salaried\nemployees who were covered in the plans on January 1, 1989, and all officers (including the NEOs) who are Senior Vice Presidents or above are\nprovided with the higher of the benefits described above or a minimum benefit based on a prior formula through the defined benefit plan, the unfunded\nexcess benefits plan described above and an unfunded deferred compensation plan. The normal retirement benefit under the prior formula is based on\nthe highest average earnings for any five consecutive years during the 10 calendar years preceding December 31, 2016 and length of service up to\n25 years. The normal retirement benefit for officers (including the NEOs) who are Senior Vice Presidents or above is based on the highest average\nearnings for any five years during the 20 calendar years preceding December 31, 2016 and length of service up to 25 years. Minimum benefit amounts\nare not subject to any deduction for Social Security benefits. Under the excess benefits plan, upon a change in control, a lump sum benefit payment shall\nbe made to each participant.\nEmployment Contracts and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control\nThe Company has entered into employment contracts with Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr. and John W. Florsheim whereby, for services to be rendered,\ntheir employment will continue until December 31, 2025, at salary levels to be determined and reviewed periodically. These contracts provide, among\nother things, that a lump sum amount equal to slightly less than three times the base amount compensation (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal\nRevenue Code) will be paid to Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr. and John W. Florsheim, respectively, as severance pay, in the event the Company terminates\nthe executive’s employment without cause or the individual terminates his employment following a change of control of the Company. A “change of\ncontrol” is defined in the employment agreements as: a change in control of more than 15% of the shares of the Company; the replacement of two or\nmore directors by persons not nominated by the Board of Directors; any enlargement of the size of the Board of Directors if the change was not\nsupported by the existing Board of Directors; a merger, consolidation or transfer of assets of the Company; or a substantial change in his responsibilities.\nIn the event Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr. or John W. Florsheim is prevented from performing his duties by reason of permanent disability, the executive’s\nnormal salary will be discontinued and a disability salary of 75% of the individual’s then-current salary will be paid until December 31, 2025.\nAlso, in the event Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr. or John W. Florsheim dies prior to the termination of his employment under the contract, a death\nbenefit equal to his salary at the annual rate being paid to the executive at the date of death will be paid to a designated beneficiary for a three-year\nperiod. As of March 31, 2024, the annual salary of Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr. is $776,000 and John W. Florsheim’s annual salary is $741,000.\nIn accordance with the terms of the 2017 Incentive Plan and 2024 Incentive Plan, if a change of control should occur, all options and stock awards\ngranted by the Company shall immediately vest.\n22\nTable of Contents\nPay Versus Performance\nAs required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are\nproviding the following information about the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and certain financial performance of the\nCompany.\nSummary Average Summary Average\nCompensation Compensation Compensation Compensation Value of Initial Fixed $100\nTable Total Actually Paid Table Total for Actually Paid to Investments based on Total Net Income\nYear for PEO(1) to PEO(2) Non-PEO NEOs(3) Non-PEO NEOs(4) Shareholder Return(5) (in Millions)(6)\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (h)\n2023 $ 1,382,943 $ 1,613,111 $ 973,370 $ 1,153,855 $ 146 $ 30.2\n2022 $ 1,347,667 $ 1,360,466 $ 937,959 $ 948,056 $ 145 $ 29.5\n(1) The dollar amounts reported in column (b) are the amounts of total compensation reported for Tom Florsheim, Jr., our principal executive officer\n(“PEO”), for each corresponding year in the “Total” column of the Summary Compensation Table.

A Grantee may, if he is otherwise eligible,\nbe granted an additional Option or Options if the Committee shall so determine.\nA-5\nTable of Contents\n6. Granting of Options.\nThe officers of the Corporation are authorized and directed, upon receipt of notice from the Committee of the granting of an Option,\n(or other Award), to sign and deliver on behalf of the Corporation, by mail or otherwise, to the Grantee an Option (or other Award) upon\nthe terms and conditions specified under the Plan and in the form of the Award Agreement.

Option Price.\nThe purchase price of the Common Stock covered by each Option shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of such Stock on the\nGrant Date. Such price shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Article 18 hereof.\n8. Option Designation.\nAt the time of the grant of each Option, the Committee shall designate the Option as (a) an Incentive Stock Option or (b) a Non-\nQualified Stock Option, as described in Sections (a) and (b) below, respectively.\n(a) Incentive Stock Options: Any Option designated as an Incentive Stock Option shall comply with the requirements of\nSection 422 of the Code, including the requirement that incentive stock options may only be granted to individuals who\nare employed by the Corporation, a parent or a Subsidiary corporation of the Corporation. If an Option is so designated,\nthe Fair Market Value (determined as of the Grant Date) of the shares of Stock with respect to which that and any other\nIncentive Stock Option first becomes exercisable during any calendar year under this Plan or any other stock option plan\nof the Corporation or its affiliates shall not exceed $100,000; provided, however, that the time or times of exercise of an\nIncentive Stock Option may be accelerated pursuant to Article 11, 12 or 18 hereof, and, in the event of such acceleration,\nsuch Incentive Stock Option shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Option to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value\n(determined as of the Grant Date) of the shares of stock with respect to which such Option first becomes exercisable in\nthe calendar year (including Options under this Plan and any other Plan of the Corporation or its affiliates) exceeds\n$100,000, the extent of such excess to be determined by the Committee taking into account the order in which the\nOptions were granted, or such other factors as may be consistent with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code and\nrules promulgated thereunder. Furthermore, no Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any individual who,\nimmediately before the Option is granted, directly or indirectly owns (within the meaning of Section 424(d) of the Code,\nas amended) shares representing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the\nCorporation or its subsidiaries, unless, at the time the option is granted, and in accordance with the provisions of Section\n422, the option price is 110% of the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock subject to the Option and the Option must be\nexercised within 5 years of the Grant Date.\n(b) Non-Qualified Stock Options: All Options not subject to or in conformance with the additional restrictions required to\nsatisfy Section 422 shall be designated Non-Qualified Stock Options.\n9. Non-transferability of Options.\nAny Option granted hereunder shall, by its terms, be non-transferable by a Grantee other than by will or the laws of descent and shall\nbe exercisable during the Grantee’s lifetime solely by the Grantee or the Grantee’s\nA-6\nTable of Contents\nduly appointed guardian or personal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may permit a Grantee to transfer a\nNon-Qualified Stock Option to a family member or a trust or partnership for the benefit of a family member, in accordance with rules\nestablished by the Committee.\n10. Substituted Options.\nIn the event the Committee cancels any Option granted under this Plan, and a new Option is substituted therefore, the Grant Date of\nthe canceled Option (except to the extent inconsistent with the restrictions described in Article 8(a), if applicable) shall be the date used to\ndetermine the earliest date for exercising the new substituted Option under Article 11 hereunder so that the Grantee may exercise the\nsubstituted Option at the same time as if the Grantee had held the substituted Option since the Grant Date of the canceled Option. Except\nin connection with a corporate transaction involving the Corporation (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split,\nextraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, or exchange of\nshares), the terms of outstanding Options may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or cancel outstanding\nOptions in exchange for cash, other awards or Options with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options\nwithout stockholder approval. Nothing in this Section 10 shall provide authority to substitute Options in a manner that will have the effect\nof repricing Options to a lower exercise price.\n11. Exercise and Term of Option.\nThe Committee shall have the power to set the time or times within which each Option shall be exercisable, and to accelerate the time\nor times of exercise, provided that no Option granted under this Plan may be exercised prior to shareholder approval of the Plan. No\nOption may be exercised if in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation the issuance or sale of Stock or payment of cash by the\nCorporation, as appropriate, pursuant to such exercise shall be unlawful for any reason, nor after the expiration of 10 years from the Grant\nDate. In no event shall the Corporation be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise of an Option. Although the Corporation\nintends to exert its best efforts so that the Stock purchasable upon the exercise of an Option, when it first comes exercisable, will be\nregistered under, or exempt from the registration requirements of, the federal Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) and any applicable state\nsecurities laws, if the exercise of an Option would otherwise result in the violation by the Corporation of any provision of the Act or of\nany state securities law, the Corporation may require that such exercise be deferred until the Corporation has taken appropriate action to\navoid any such violation.\n12. Effect of Termination of Employment, Disability or Death.\nUnless otherwise provided herein or in a specific Option Agreement which may provide longer or shorter periods of exercisability, no\nOption shall be exercisable after the expiration of the earliest of\n(i) in the case of an Incentive Stock Option:\n(1) 10 years from the date the option is granted, or five years from the date the option is granted to an\nindividual owning (after the application of the family and other attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the\nCode) at the time such option was granted, more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all\nclasses of stock of the Corporation;\n(2) three months after the date the Grantee ceases to perform services for the Corporation or its Subsidiaries,\nif such cessation is for any reason other than death, Disability, or Cause;\nA-7\nTable of Contents\n(3) one year after the date the Grantee ceases to perform services for the Corporation or its Subsidiaries, if\nsuch cessation is by reason of death or Disability; or\n(4) the date the Grantee ceases to perform services for the Corporation or its Subsidiaries, if such cessation is\nfor Cause, as determined by the Board or the Committee in its sole discretion;\n(ii) in the case of a Nonqualified Stock Option:\n(1) 10 years from the date of grant;\n(2) ninety days after the date the Grantee ceases to perform services for the Corporation or its Subsidiaries, if\nsuch cessation is for any reason other than death, Disability or Cause;\n(3) one year after the date the Grantee ceases to perform services for the Corporation or its Subsidiaries, if\nsuch cessation is by reason of death or Disability; or\n(4) the date the Grantee ceases to perform services for the Corporation or its Subsidiaries, if such cessation is\nfor Cause, as determined by the Board or the Committee in its sole discretion;\nProvided, that, unless otherwise provided in a specific grant agreement or determined by the Committee, an Option shall only be\nexercisable for the periods above following the date an optionee ceases to perform services to the extent the option was exercisable on the\ndate of such cessation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Option shall be exercisable after the date of expiration of its term. In the event\nof Grantee’s death, the person or persons to whom the Option is transferred by will or the laws of descent and distribution with respect to\nan Incentive Stock Option or the Grantee’s beneficiary designated under Section 21 of the Plan shall be the person or persons who may\nexercise the Option to the extent the Grantee was entitled to do so.\n13. Method of Exercise.\nTo the extent that the right to purchase shares pursuant to an Option has accrued hereunder, such Option may be exercised from time\nto time by written notice to the Corporation stating the number of shares being purchased and accompanied by the payment in full of the\nOption price for such shares. Such payment shall be made in cash or, with the approval of the Committee, by surrendering to the\nCorporation shares of Stock otherwise receivable upon exercise of an Option or by delivery of outstanding shares of the Common Stock\nwhich the Grantee, the Grantee’s spouse or both have beneficially owned for at least six months prior to the time of exercise, or in\ncombinations thereof. If shares of Common Stock are used in part or full payment for the shares to be acquired upon exercise of the\nOption, such shares shall be valued for the purpose of such exchange as of the date of exercise of the Option at a price not exceeding the\nFair Market Value of the shares.\n14. Restricted Stock Awards.\nThe Committee may, in its discretion, grant Restricted Stock to Directors, officers and salaried Employees of the Corporation and any\nof its subsidiaries. Restricted Stock Awards may consist of shares issued subject to forfeiture if specified conditions are not satisfied\n(“Restricted Stock Shares”) or agreements to issue shares of Common Stock in the future if specified conditions are satisfied (“Restricted\nStock Units”).

Any cash dividends on shares of\nRestricted Stock shall be accumulated by the Corporation and paid to the Grantee when and if the shares vest; provided\nthat the Committee may elect to pay cash dividends on unvested shares of Restricted Stock to the Grantee currently. Any\ndividends payable in stock shall be paid in the form of additional Restricted Stock Shares.\n(g) A Grantee receiving an Award of Restricted Stock Units shall not be deemed the holder of any shares covered by the\nAward, or have any rights as a shareholder with respect thereto, until such shares are issued to him/her; provided,\nhowever, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, whenever dividends are paid or distributions are made\nwith respect to shares of Stock, dividend equivalents shall be credited on all Restricted Stock Units awarded to and held\nby a Grantee as of the record date for such dividend or distribution. Such dividend equivalents shall be credited in the\nform of additional Restricted Stock Units in a number determined by dividing the aggregate value of such dividend\nequivalents by the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock at the payment date of such dividend or distribution.\n15.

Performance Shares may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or\nhypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, a Grantee’s rights under the Plan shall be exercisable\nduring the Grantee’s lifetime only by the Grantee or the Grantee’s legal representative.\n16. Cash Incentive Awards.\nThe Committee may, in its discretion, grant Cash Incentive Awards to officers and salaried employees of the Corporation.

Beneficiary Designation.\nEach Grantee may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to\nwhom any benefit under the Plan (other than an Incentive Stock Option) is to be paid in case of the Grantee’s death before the Grantee\nreceives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Grantee, shall be in a form\nprescribed by the Committee, and shall be effective only when filed by the Grantee in writing with the Company during the Grantee’s\nlifetime. In the absence of any such beneficiary designation, benefits remaining unpaid or rights\nA-11\nTable of Contents\nremaining unexercised at the Grantee’s death shall be paid to or exercised by the Grantee’s executor, administrator or legal representative.\n22. Shareholder Rights.\nGrantee shall not, by reason of any Options, Restricted Stock Units or Performance Shares granted hereunder, have any right of a\nshareholder of the Corporation with respect to the shares covered by Grantee’s Options, Restricted Stock Units or Performance Shares\nuntil shares of Stock have been issued to him.\n23. Controlling Law.\nThe law of the State of Wisconsin, except its law with respect to choice of law, shall be controlling in all matters relating to the Plan.\n24. Indemnification.\nIn addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have, the members of the Committee and other Corporation Employees\nadministering the Plan and the Board members shall be indemnified by the Corporation against the reasonable expenses, including\nattorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any\nappeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the\nPlan or any Award granted thereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved\nby independent legal counsel selected by the Corporation) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or\nproceeding, except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such member acted in bad\nfaith in the performance of his duties; provided that within 20 days after institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, the member\nshall in writing offer the Corporation the opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same.\n25. Use of Proceeds.\nThe proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Options granted under the Plan shall constitute general funds of\nthe Corporation.\n26. Amendment of the Plan.\nThe Board may from time to time amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Plan; provided, however, that no such action shall be taken\nwithout shareholder approval if shareholder approval is required pursuant to rules promulgated by any stock exchange or quotation system\non which shares of Stock are listed or quoted or by applicable U.S. state corporate laws or regulations, or U.S. federal laws or regulations.\n27. Effective Date of Plan.\nThe Plan shall become effective on the date approved by the shareholders of the Corporation (the “Effective Date”).\n28. Termination of the Plan.\nThe Plan shall terminate ten years following the Effective Date, and no Awards shall be granted after such date under the Plan;\nprovided, however, that the Plan shall terminate at such earlier time as the Board may\nA-12\nTable of Contents\ndetermine. Any such termination, either partially or wholly, shall not affect any Awards then outstanding under the Plan.\n29. Compliance with Code Section 409A.\nTo the extent that a benefit under the Plan is subject to the requirements of Code Section 409A, it is intended that the Plan, as applied\nto that benefit, comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and the Plan shall be so administered and interpreted. The Board or\nCommittee may make any changes required to conform the Plan and any Awards with applicable Code provisions and administrative\nguidance relating to Code Section 409A.\nA-13\nSnecppcDFaWmtAAwePS2WMCcWwohoh aaxalp a0 nli NURHi i ohe e Aorg e Eir tera rmrp c7 ltohe mia ip eDTOOdr Thnt y lnYcn ho 3s en uhcseo t cH a E pu eMWg hi ii 0Ce e gt oRe n nnnosr rt o at ROee 3-aur h elo aPO g ot NEd Crs nca tsmGi 0tr IdRsr cm h mTih 3 Aeh T y, p o oo 0a ucG tr HeeIi Lf ' eao LU p iro nnp 0sT euio co nO n fYERcd See u sa,, 0 istYRrf ett wn nk h mh R ena p Opp n s0:S ItT e oN g o o eNhe F n.vr ,tll y 0TEi Uh eeh f h rn b e ey t F IO co i 0 hiTr o ,aaaa Bnne TtPi o si lx oe On 0s y er oRHm ydssr sc a iH,u sgt eb 0t pPr oee t.

Our Company achieved record earnings by maintaining pricing\nintegrity while taking a disciplined approach to expenses, despite falling short of prior year milestone-level record revenues.\nOur 2023 wholesale sales decreased compared to peak sales in 2022, which were driven by retailer pipeline fill and pent-up\nconsumer demand following historic supply chain delays. In 2023, the collective wholesale revenues of our Florsheim, Stacy\nAdams and Nunn Bush brands decreased 5% compared to 2022, while BOGS trailed prior year record sales by 31%. All our\nbrands experienced softer demand, as consumer discretionary spending shifted from hard goods, including footwear and\napparel, toward experiences and services. Retailers, in turn, became more cautious with orders in an effort to keep their\ninventories in line.\nThe change in retail dynamics was most striking in the outdoor market in 2023, impacting our BOGS brand. Given the spike in\ndemand in outdoor categories in 2021 and the first half of 2022, retailers placed heavy orders with the expectation of strong\nconsumer sell-throughs. Sales did not keep pace in the back half of 2022, and the outdoor trade channel entered 2023 with an\ninventory glut, and retailers slowed their buying considerably. For BOGS, with its significant winter boot business, the situation\nwas exacerbated by unseasonably warm fall and winter weather, leading to the double-digit sales decrease in 2023 compared\nto 2022.\nIn 2023, our retail segment outperformed record sales and earnings of the previous year, due to the continuing growth of our\ne-commerce businesses. We achieved higher e-commerce sales across our legacy brands, led by Florsheim. We are especially\nproud of this accomplishment, as industry statistics indicate overall e-commerce sales of footwear were down for the year. We\nview our direct-to-consumer business as a growth opportunity and continue to invest in our e-commerce platform.\nResults for our other businesses in Australia, Asia Pacific, and South Africa dampened in 2023, due to retail slowdowns and the\nloss of a significant wholesale account in Australia. Near the end of 2023, we exited our Asia Pacific business, and we are in the\nprocess of transitioning key wholesale customers to Australia.\nOur balance sheet is strong, which allows us to invest in our brands and make strategic decisions for the long-term. We\ncurrently have strong cash balances and no outstanding debt. In 2023, we managed our inventories down to normalized levels\nfrom peak quantities at the end of 2022. We invested in our distribution center to increase the efficiency of our operations.\nWe continue to review acquisition opportunities to enhance our portfolio of brands, and buy back our Company stock when\nmarket conditions are favorable.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we expect softer demand for our products to continue in the first half of the year. We are working\nhard to secure orders in a tepid environment, and are encouraged by the strength of our men’s brands as evidenced by our\ncontinuing solid sell-throughs at retail. We are optimistic that outdoor retailers will work through excess inventories by the\nback half of this year, benefitting BOGS’ upcoming busy season.\nIn 2024 and beyond, we are excited to continue to move forward with a leaner post-pandemic structure after shedding\nunprofitable portions of our business in Europe, Asia, and our U.S. retail segment over the past several years. We are focused\non maintaining our pricing integrity, controlling our costs, and continuing to find new ways to increase our operating\nefficiencies. With respect to our men’s legacy brands, industry studies indicate post-pandemic gains in market share rankings\nof each of our three major brands in fashion footwear categories, and we continue to increase our penetration in casual and\nhybrid footwear categories. With BOGS, we continue to diversify our product assortment in favor of less weather-dependent\nstyles. Overall, we are more focused than ever on our core brands, businesses, and competencies.\nWe thank you for your interest in and support of our Company.\nThomas W. Florsheim, Jr. John W.

Therefore, the reader is cautioned that these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties\nor other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks\nand uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in this report under Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n1\nPART 1\nITEM 1 BUSINESS\nThe Company is a Wisconsin corporation incorporated in the year 1906 as Weyenberg Shoe Manufacturing Company. Effective\nApril 25, 1990, the name of the corporation was changed to Weyco Group, Inc.\nWeyco Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively, \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" and the “Company”) designs, markets, and distributes quality\nand innovative footwear principally for men, but also for women and children, under a portfolio of well-recognized brand names\nincluding: Florsheim, Nunn Bush, Stacy Adams, BOGS, Rafters, and Forsake. Trademarks we maintain on our brands are important to\nour business. Our products consist primarily of mid-priced leather dress shoes, casual footwear composed of man-made materials and\nleather, and outdoor boots, shoes, and sandals. Our footwear is available in a broad range of sizes and widths, primarily designed to\nmeet the needs and desires of the general American population.\nWe purchase finished shoes from outside suppliers, primarily located in China and India, and we have recently begun contracting with\nsuppliers located in Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Dominican Republic. Almost all of these foreign-sourced purchases are denominated\nin U.S. dollars. While we source from more than 80 suppliers, our two largest suppliers each accounted for more than 10% of our total\ninventory purchases in 2023. Costs from our suppliers have historically been relatively stable, although in recent years there have been\nupward cost pressures due to higher freight, labor, and material costs, as well as due to tariffs and other trade protection measures. Since\nthe pandemic in 2020, there have been worldwide supply chain challenges that first caused inbound freight costs to increase, and more\nrecently returned to just above pre-pandemic levels.\nOur business is separated into two reportable segments – the North American wholesale segment (“Wholesale”) and the North American\nretail segment (“Retail”). We also have other wholesale and retail businesses overseas in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific\n(collectively, “Florsheim Australia”). However, we ceased operations in the Asia Pacific region in 2023, and are in the final stages of\nwinding down this business.\nSales in our Wholesale segment, which include both wholesale sales and worldwide licensing revenues, constituted 79% and 81% of\ntotal net sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively. At Wholesale, our shoes are marketed by retailers throughout the United States and\nCanada in more than 10,000 shoe, clothing and department stores. In 2023 and 2022, no individual customer represented 10% or more\nof our total net sales. We employ traveling salespeople and independent sales representatives who sell our products to retail outlets.\nShoes are shipped to these retailers primarily from our distribution center in Glendale, Wisconsin. In the men’s footwear business, there\nis generally no identifiable seasonality, although new styles are historically developed and shown twice each year, in spring and fall.\nWith the BOGS brand, its strong presence in the winter and outdoor boot category results in some seasonality; the majority of BOGS\nsales occur in the third and fourth quarters. Consistent with industry practices, we carry significant amounts of inventory to meet\ncustomer delivery requirements and periodically provide extended payment terms to customers. We also have licensing agreements\nwith third parties who sell our branded apparel, accessories, and specialty footwear in the United States, as well as our footwear in\nMexico and certain markets overseas.\nSales in our Retail segment constituted 12% and 10% of total net sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Retail segment consists of\ne-commerce businesses and four brick and mortar stores in the United States. Retail sales are made directly to consumers on our\nwebsites, or by our employees in our stores. We believe that the results of our Retail segment will continue to be driven by our\ne-commerce businesses, as we have a limited number of brick-and-mortar stores. We intend to continue to focus on investing in and\ngrowing our e-commerce businesses.\nSales of our other businesses constituted 9% of total net sales in both 2023 and 2022, respectively. These sales came from our wholesale\nand retail operations at Florsheim Australia.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 608 persons worldwide, of whom 397 were full-time employees.\nBrand recognition, price, quality, and service, are all important competitive factors in the shoe industry. We have a design department\nthat continually reviews and updates product designs. Compliance with environmental and other government regulations historically\nhas not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our results of operations, although there can be no assurances as to the\nfuture.\nWe make available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on\nForm 8-K, proxy statements on Schedule 14A and all amendments to those reports upon written or telephone request. Investors can\nalso access these reports through our website, www.weycogroup.com, as soon as reasonably practical after we file or furnish those reports to\n2\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference and are not a part of\nthis filing. Also available on our website are various documents relating to our corporate governance, including our Code of Business\nEthics.\nITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nThere are various factors that affect or might affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, many of which are beyond\nour control. The following is a description of some of the material factors that could materially and adversely affect our reputation,\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk factors related to our operations\nWe rely on independent foreign sources of production and the availability of leather, rubber and other raw materials; a deterioration\nin our relationships, or other issues affecting such manufacturers and/or issues with the availability of raw materials could have\nunfavorable effects on our business.\nWe purchase all our products from independent foreign manufacturers, primarily in China and India. Although we believe that we have\ngood working relationships with our manufacturers, we do not have long-term contracts with them. Thus, we could experience increases\nin manufacturing costs, disruptions in the timely supply of products or unanticipated reductions in manufacturing capacity, any of which\ncould negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. We can move production to different suppliers;\nhowever, the transition may not occur smoothly or quickly, or at the same cost, which could result in us missing customer delivery date\nrequirements and, consequently, we could lose future orders and our reputation may be harmed.\nOur use of foreign sources of production results in relatively long production and delivery lead times. Therefore, we typically forecast\ndemand at least five months in advance. If our forecasts are wrong or there are significant changes in demand, it would result in a loss\nof sales if we do not have enough product on hand or in reduced margins if we have excess inventory that needs to be sold at discounted\nprices.\nOur ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by disruptions at U.S. or foreign ports or other\ntransportation facilities, such as those due to labor disputes and work stoppages, political unrest, trade protection measures or trade wars,\nsevere weather (climate change may increase the frequency and severity of severe weather conditions or events), outbreaks of infectious\ndiseases, or security requirements in the United States and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require\nus to locate alternate ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to our customers. These alternatives may not be available on\nshort notice or could result in higher transportation costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall profitability.\nOur products depend on the availability of raw materials, especially leather and rubber. Any significant shortages of quantities or\nincreases in the cost of leather or rubber would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, unless we were able to\npass such costs along to our customers.\nAdditional risks associated with foreign sourcing that could negatively impact our business include adverse changes in foreign economic\nconditions, import regulations, restrictions on the transfer of funds, duties, tariffs, quotas and political or labor interruptions, foreign\ncurrency fluctuations, expropriation, and nationalization. It is difficult to predict the effects of current or future tariffs and other trade\nbarriers and disputes, and our efforts to reduce the effects of tariffs through pricing and other measures may not be effective.\nA disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our profitability.\nMost of our products for North American distribution are shipped to us via ocean freight carriers to ports primarily on the west coast of\nNorth America. Our reliance on ocean freight transportation for the delivery of our inventory exposes us to various inherent risks,\nincluding port congestion, severe weather conditions, labor issues, natural disasters, and terrorism, any of which could result in delivery\ndelays and inefficiencies, increased costs and disruption of business. In 2021 and in the first half of 2022, our supply chain was disrupted\nby congestion throughout the supply chain, domestic port and warehousing delays, and container shortages, resulting in us incurring\npremium freight charges on a portion of our imports. In addition to these factors, global inflation has contributed to already higher\nincremental freight costs. Severe disruptions of the supply chain may force us to use more expensive methods to ship our products, and\nwe may not be able to meet our customers’ delivery requirements, which may result in the loss of sales.\n3\nAny severe and prolonged disruption to ocean freight transportation could force us to rely on alternate and more expensive transportation\nsystems. Efficient and timely inventory deliveries and proper inventory management are important factors in our operations. Extended\ndelays and disruptions in shipments could result in changes in the availability of inventory, increased shipping costs, or missed sales\nthat may materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nLoss of the services of our top executives and an inability to effectively manage leadership transitions, could adversely affect the\nbusiness.\nThomas W. Florsheim, Jr., our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John W. Florsheim, our President, Chief Operating Officer\nand Assistant Secretary, each have a strong heritage within our Company and the footwear industry. They possess knowledge,\nrelationships and reputations based on their lifetime exposure to and experience at our Company and the industry. The unexpected loss\nof either one or both of our top executives could have an adverse impact on our performance. A loss of the skills, industry knowledge,\ncontacts, and expertise of any of our senior executives could cause a setback to our operating plan and strategy. In addition, transitions\nof important responsibilities to new individuals include the possibility of disruptions, which could negatively impact our business and\nresults of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control procedures over our financial reporting and disclosures, investor confidence may be\nadversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price.\nWe are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures. As\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the\nsupervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. If we fail to maintain adequate controls resulting in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting,\nand/or if we are unable to remediate a material weakness on a timely basis, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or\nthe value of our stock may be adversely impacted.\nIn 2023, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Please see Item 9A of this Form 10-K for a\nfull discussion of this item.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate new brands and businesses.\nWe continue to look for acquisition opportunities. Those search efforts could be unsuccessful and costs could be incurred in any failed\nefforts. Further, if and when an acquisition occurs, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate the brand into our\ncurrent operations, or that any acquired brand would achieve results in line with our historical performance or our specific expectations\nfor the brand.\nRisk factors related to our business and industry\nDecreases in disposable income and general market volatility in the U.S. and global economy may adversely affect our Company.\nSpending patterns in the footwear market, particularly those in the moderate-priced market in which a majority of our products compete,\nhave historically been correlated with consumers’ disposable income. As a result, the success of our Company is affected by changes\nin general economic conditions, especially in the United States. Factors affecting discretionary income for our consumers include,\namong others, gas and energy costs, inflation rates, employment rates, interest rates and taxation. Additionally, changes in the economy\nand consumer behavior generally impact the financial strength and buying patterns of retailers, which also affects our results. Volatile,\nunstable, or weak economic conditions, or a worsening of conditions, could adversely affect our sales volume and overall performance.\nWe are subject to risks related to operating in the retail environment that could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business in the retail environment, primarily in the United States. The U.S. retail industry\nhas experienced a growing trend toward consolidation of large retailers. The merger of additional major retailers could result in us losing\nsales volume or increasing our concentration of business with a few large accounts, resulting in reduced bargaining power, which could\nincrease pricing pressures and lower our margins.\nWe regularly assess our retail locations in the U.S. and overseas and have closed unprofitable retail locations and incurred costs related\nto such closures. Future closures could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nAs the popularity of online shopping for consumer goods continues to increase, our retail partners in the U.S. and abroad may experience\ndecreased foot traffic, which could negatively impact their businesses. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary decrease\nin foot traffic; other significant health pandemic or outbreaks of infectious diseases could also lead to a similar decrease in foot traffic.\nDecreases in foot traffic have, and in the future may, in turn, negatively impact our sales to those customers, and adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\n4\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which may result in lower prices and reduced profits.\nThe footwear market is extremely competitive. We compete with numerous manufacturers, distributors and retailers of men’s, women’s\nand children’s shoes, some of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do. We compete with these companies\nprimarily on the basis of brand recognition, price, quality, and service, all of which are important competitive factors in the shoe industry.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon these factors, as well as our ability to deliver new products at the best value for the\nconsumer, maintain positive brand recognition, and obtain sufficient retail floor space and effective product presentation at retail. If we\ndo not remain competitive, future prospects, results of operations and financial condition would decline.\nChanges in fashion trends and consumer preferences could negatively impact the Company.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer\npreferences. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, purchases of dress and other dress-casual footwear were negatively\naffected in 2020 through early 2022 as many consumers worked from home due to stay-at-home orders or otherwise, and social as well\nas other occasion-related events were cancelled. Failure to predict or effectively respond to trends or preferences could have an adverse\nimpact on our sales volume and overall performance, as well as have a negative impact on our reputation.\nWe conduct business globally, which exposes us to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as political, economic and\nsocial risks.\nA portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, with our primary exposures being to\nthe Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. We are therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure.\nExchange rates can be volatile and could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are exposed to other risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including political, economic, or social instability, armed\nconflicts, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, changes in government policies and regulations, outbreaks of infectious diseases, severe weather\nevents, natural disasters, and exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). We are\nalso exposed to risks relating to U.S. policy with respect to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Additional legislation or\nother changes in the U.S. tax laws or interpretations could increase our U.S. income tax liability and adversely affect our after-tax\nprofitability. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the\nimposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn response to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed significant\nsanctions and export controls against Russia, Belarus and certain individuals and entities connected to Russian or Belarusian political,\nbusiness, and financial organizations. The situation remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict the impact that the conflict and actions\ntaken in response to it will have on our business. Our business may be impacted as a result of various factors, including inflation and\nactions taken to combat inflation, increased energy prices, a slowing U.S. economy, more ocean freight disruptions, increased cyber-\nattacks, and reduced consumer confidence.\nRisk factors related to cybersecurity\nWe are dependent on information and communication systems to support our business and e-commerce sales. Significant\ninterruptions could disrupt our business and damage our reputation.\nWe accept and fill the majority of our larger customers’ orders through the use of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and we rely on\nour warehouse management system to efficiently process orders. Our corporate office relies on computer systems to efficiently process\nand record transactions. Significant interruptions in EDI, information and communication systems from power loss, telecommunications\nfailure, malicious attacks, or computer system failure could significantly disrupt our business and operations, as well as damage our\nreputation. In addition, we sell footwear on our websites, and failures of our or other retailers’ websites could adversely affect our sales,\nresults, and reputation.\nWe are subject to the risk of data loss and security breaches, particularly in our retail segment and our e-commerce businesses.\nWe sell footwear in our retail stores and on our websites, and therefore we and/or our third-party credit card processors must process,\nstore, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information of our customers. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or\nother security breaches, including breaches of our technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse\nof such information, which could adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability, and/or otherwise harm\nour business and/or reputation. Our technology and systems, as well as those of our partners have, and in the future may, become the\ntarget of cyberattacks. To our knowledge, we have not experienced a material breach; however, in order to address these risks, we have\nsecured cyber insurance and use third party technology and systems to aid in safeguarding our data and systems, including, without\nlimitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Although\nwe have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security\nbreaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures\ncannot provide absolute security.\n5\nRisk factors related to environmental, social, and corporate governance (“ESG”)\nWe may be unable to complete ESG initiatives, in whole or in part, which could lead to less opportunity for us to have ESG investors\nand partners and could negatively impact ESG-focused investors when evaluating the Company.\nThere has been increased focus on ESG matters by consumers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders, as well as by governmental\nand non-governmental organizations. We have undertaken, and plan to continue undertaking, ESG initiatives. Any failure by us to meet\nour commitments, or loss of confidence on the part of customers, investors, employees, brand partners and other stakeholders as it relates\nto our ESG initiatives, could negatively impact our brands, business, financial condition, and our operating results. These impacts could\nbe difficult and costly to overcome, even if such concerns were based on inaccurate or misleading information.\nIn addition, achieving our ESG initiatives may result in increased costs in our supply chain, fulfillment, or corporate business operations,\nand could deviate from our initial estimates and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition,\nstandards and research regarding ESG initiatives could change and become more onerous both for the Company and our third-party\nsuppliers and vendors to meet successfully. Evolving data and research could undermine or refute the Company’s current claims and\nbeliefs that it has made in reliance on current research, which could also result in costs, a decrease in revenue, changes to projections or\nplans, and negative market perception that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nA variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on such ESG topics, and the results of these assessments may be\nwidely publicized. In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly\npopular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures to their investment decisions.\nTopics considered in such assessments include, among others, the company’s efforts and impacts on climate change and human rights,\nethics and compliance with laws, and the role of the company’s board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues. In light\nof investors’ increased focus on ESG matters, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will\nsuccessfully meet investors’ or society’s ESG expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nFinally, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in\nthose voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or\nactual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and\nassumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved in\nmeasuring and reporting on many ESG matters.\nRisk factors related to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases\nFuture public health emergencies, including a resurgence in the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a long duration and significant\nimpacts that could adversely affect our operations, supply chain, distribution, and demand for our products, which could, in turn,\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had widespread, rapidly-evolving, and unpredicted impacts on global financial markets and business practices.\nAs conditions fluctuated, governments responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. The scope, nature, and\nduration of any future public health emergencies, including a resurgence in the COVID-19 pandemic, is uncertain. While the COVID-19\npandemic has subsided with the normalization of living with COVID-19 following the increase in accessibility to COVID-19 vaccines\nand antiviral treatments, the full impact of a future public health emergency or a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations is uncertain and will continue to depend on future developments, such as the ultimate\nduration and scope of the health emergency, its impact on our employees, customers and suppliers, the effectiveness and adoption of\nvaccines and therapeutics and the broader implications on the macro-economic environment. Such emergencies may cause or require us\nto take actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or which we determine to be\nin the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, and shareholders.\nPublic health emergency-related factors that have impacted us, or may negatively impact, sales, gross margin and other results of\noperations in the future include, but are not limited to: limitations on the ability of our suppliers to obtain necessary raw materials and\nparts to manufacture, or procure from manufacturers, the products we sell; transportation delays and other logistical challenges resulting\nin longer lead times; limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness or other disruptions caused by the\npandemic, including local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home; labor shortages or an increase in the cost of\nlabor; limitations on the ability of carriers to deliver our products to customers; limitations on the ability of our customers to purchase\nour products; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis.\nThe potential negative financial of a future public health emergency or a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and\nresults of operations cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material and last for an extended period of time.\n6\nRisks related to financing, investment, and pension matters\nVolatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and global credit markets could adversely affect our business.\nU.S. and global financial markets have at times been unstable and unpredictable, which has generally resulted in tightened credit markets\nwith heightened lending standards and terms. The ultimate impact on the U.S. and global financial markets of the Russian invasion of\nUkraine cannot yet be predicted, and will depend on the severity and duration of the conflict and the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and\nother countries. Volatility and instability in the credit markets pose various risks to us, including, among others, a negative impact on\nretailer and consumer confidence, limits to our customers’ access to credit markets and interference with the normal commercial\nrelationships between us and our customers. Increased credit risks associated with the financial condition of some customers in the\nretail industry affects their level of purchases from us and the collectability of amounts owed to us, and in some cases, causes us to\nreduce or cease shipments to certain customers who no longer meet our credit requirements.\nIn addition, weak economic conditions and unstable and volatile financial markets could lead to certain of our customers experiencing\ncash flow problems, which may force them into higher default rates or to file for bankruptcy protection which may increase our bad debt\nexpense or further negatively impact our business.\nInterest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing. Our U.S. dollar variable rate debt currently uses the secured overnight\nfinancing rate (“SOFR”) as a benchmark for determining interest rates. In connection with our line of credit amendment in\nSeptember 2022, SOFR became the new benchmark interest rate and all London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) provisions were\nreplaced with SOFR provisions.\nDeterioration of the municipal bond market in general or of specific municipal bonds held by the Company or our pension plan may\nresult in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of investment-grade municipal bond investments. Our investment policy only\npermits the purchase of investment-grade securities. Our investment portfolio totaled $6.6 million as of December 31, 2023, or\napproximately 2% of total assets. If the value of municipal bonds in general or any of our municipal bond holdings deteriorate, the\nperformance of our investment portfolio, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk factors related to our capital structure\nThe limited public float and trading volume for our Company’s stock may have an adverse impact on the stock price or make it\ndifficult to liquidate.\nThe Company’s common stock is held by a relatively small number of shareholders. The Florsheim family and company insiders own\nmore than 50% of the stock and one institutional shareholder holds a significant block. Other officers, directors, and members of\nmanagement own stock or have the potential to own stock through previously granted stock options and restricted stock. Consequently,\nwe have a relatively small public float and low average daily trading volume, which could affect a shareholder’s ability to sell stock or\nthe price at which it can be sold. In addition, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by large\nshareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely impact the market price of the stock and the stock could be\ndifficult for the shareholder to liquidate.\nITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone\nITEM 1C CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe face various cybersecurity risks and threats that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial\nperformance, liquidity, and reputation. We have implemented processes and systems to identify, assess, and manage these risks and\nthreats, as well as to prevent, detect, and respond to any cybersecurity incidents that may occur, which is integrated into our overall risk\nmanagement process. We also have a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, policy, and program that aligns with our business objectives\nand risk appetite. We regularly review and update our cybersecurity strategy, policy, and program to address the evolving nature and\nscope of cybersecurity risks and threats. In addition, we consider the cybersecurity practices of our third-party service providers, through\na general security assessment and contractual requirements, as appropriate, before engaging them in order to help identify and mitigate\ncybersecurity risks associated with those providers.\n7\nWe comply with various laws, regulations, standards, and guidance related to cybersecurity, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\nthe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity\nFramework and the SEC's guidance on cybersecurity disclosures.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we did not experience any cybersecurity incidents that materially impacted, or are\nreasonably likely to materially impact, our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. Please refer to the risk factors\ndescribed in this report under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the potential impacts of future cybersecurity events.\nOur Information Technology (“IT”) security department, led by our Vice President of Information Systems (“IS”) and Distribution and\noverseen by our Director of IS, holds primary responsibility for assessing and managing cybersecurity threats. Our Vice President of IS\nand Distribution has more than 34 years of experience in IT and holds a bachelor’s degree in Management of IS; his in-depth knowledge\nand experience are instrumental in developing and executing our cybersecurity strategies. Our Director of IS has more than 20 years of\nexperience in various IT and IS roles, and holds a bachelor’s degree in Accounting and Finance.\nA team of IT Specialists (including a Cybersecurity Analyst) at our Company is tasked with monitoring cybersecurity and operational\nrisks associated with information security and system disruption. This team employs measures aimed at protecting against, detecting,\nand responding to cybersecurity threats, and has implemented processes and procedures in line with our information security\nmanagement system to bolster and advance resilient programs. This encompasses:\n• Continuously developing and evaluating our program in accordance with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This Framework\nserves as a reference to aid in the identification, assessment, and mitigation of cybersecurity risks pertinent to our business\noperations.\n• Engaging third-party IT security vendors to conduct ongoing assessments and monitoring of our networks and devices.\nAdditionally, we routinely collaborate with assessors, consultants, and other third-party entities to review our cybersecurity\nprogram. These efforts aim to identify areas requiring sustained attention, enhancement, and alignment with regulatory\nrequirements. Certifications held by our cybersecurity consultants include but are not limited to: CISSP, CISM, CCNP, and\nCMMC-RP.\n• Conducting regular cybersecurity awareness training, which is available for all employees during which we provide seminars,\npresentations, and employee engagement activities designed to reinforce our employee information security training and\nenhance the culture and knowledge of cybersecurity risks among our employees.\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Audit Committee is provided with regular updates from management concerning cybersecurity developments, significant\ncybersecurity threats, risks and processes implemented to address these risks. Our Audit Committee receives presentations on\ncybersecurity topics from management as part of the Committee’s continuing education on topics that impact the Company.\nFurthermore, management informs the Audit Committee as deemed necessary, about any notable cybersecurity incidents.\nITEM 2 PROPERTIES\nThe following facilities were operated by the Company or its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023:\nOwned/ Square\nLocation Character Leased Footage % Utilized\nGlendale, Wisconsin (1) ...................

Inventory is purchased\nfrom third-party overseas manufacturers. Almost all of these foreign-sourced purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. We have two\nreportable segments, North American wholesale operations (“Wholesale”) and North American retail operations (“Retail”). In the\nWholesale segment, our products are sold to leading footwear, department, and specialty stores, as well as e-commerce retailers,\nprimarily in the United States and Canada. We also have licensing agreements with third parties who sell our branded apparel,\naccessories, and specialty footwear in the United States, as well as our footwear in Mexico and certain markets overseas. Licensing\nrevenues are included in our Wholesale segment. Our Retail segment consists of e-commerce businesses and four brick-and-mortar\nretail stores in the United States. Retail sales are made directly to consumers on our websites, or by our employees in our stores. Our\n“other” operations include our wholesale and retail businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific (collectively, “Florsheim\nAustralia”). However, we ceased operations in the Asia Pacific region in 2023, and are in the final stages of winding down this business.\nThe majority of our operations are in the United States, and our results are primarily affected by the economic conditions and the retail\nenvironment in the United States.\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial position, and liquidity of our\ncompany for the two-year period ended December 31, 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data” below.\nKNOWN TRENDS IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS\nMacroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and the global economy have created a tepid retail environment. Following a period of\nunprecedented supply chain disruptions, retailers are being cautious with their inventory levels, which reduces wholesale customer\norders. Additionally, consumers are currently spending more of their discretionary income on experiences and services and less on\nfootwear and apparel. Looking ahead, we expect to face continued headwinds as a result of the challenging retail environment in the\nfirst half of 2024, but we continue to focus on building our backlogs and are optimistic that demand will improve in the back half of the\nyear.\n10\nPost-pandemic disruptions in the supply chain in 2021 and the first half of 2022 affected the flow of our inventory into the U.S. over the\npast few years. In 2022, we brought in much of our inventory for the Spring 2023 selling season early based on the expectation that\nextended inventory transit times would last throughout much of 2022. As a result, our inventory was at peak levels at December 31,\n2022. By the end of 2022, inventory transit times had improved and supply chain issues had subsided. In 2023, we managed our\ninventory down to more normalized levels.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nWe experienced a slowdown in sales in 2023, mainly as a result of lower wholesale shipments compared to record sales in 2022. Though\nsales were down, we achieved record operating and net earnings in 2023 by maintaining our pricing integrity while taking a disciplined\napproach to our expenses.\nIn our Wholesale segment, net sales of our BOGS brand were down 31% in 2023, compared to the prior year. Mild weather throughout\nthe Fall and early Winter, in combination with an inventory glut in the outdoor market, led to the sales decline. We believe the outdoor\nboot market will remain challenging throughout 2024 as retailers continue to right size their inventories. With BOGS, we are focused\non moving the business forward through product innovation with an emphasis on our BOGS seamless rubber boot construction. BOGS\nseamless construction is 30% lighter than comparable vulcanized rubber boots and over twice as durable as measured by the number of\nflexes our seamless boots can withstand without any sign of cracking. This year, we are expanding the number of seamless boots in our\nline across numerous price points. In addition to the expansion of our seamless collection, we are also introducing new non-insulated\nand lightly insulated footwear so the BOGS brand is less dependent on inclement weather.\nNet sales of our legacy businesses (comprised of the Florsheim, Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams brands) were collectively down 5% for\nthe year. At the brand level, Florsheim, Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams were down 4%, 2%, and 10%, respectively, for the year. The\ndecline in sales of all three brands reflects a general slowdown in the market for dress and dress casual footwear. In addition, many of\nour retail partners have shifted to more of a “chase” strategy in order to maintain greater inventory flexibility. We see the decrease in\nour legacy shipments as part of a return to a normal business cycle after a period of heightened demand and supply chain delays. We\nanticipate this trend will continue through the first half of 2024. Our sell-throughs at retail remain solid, and we continue to diversify\nour product mix across all three brands to expand our casual and hybrid offerings.\nIn our Retail segment, sales were up 4% for the year, driven by growth in our e-commerce businesses. Overall, we believe we had\nstrong direct consumer performance for the year, with a solid sales increase in 2023 as well as record retail operating earnings. We view\nour direct-to-consumer business as a growth opportunity and continue to invest in our online platform.\nFlorsheim Australia’s net sales in local currency were down 3% for the year. The loss of a significant wholesale account as well as soft\nconsumer demand presented challenges in the Australian market. We anticipate headwinds through the first half of 2024 and are focused\non reducing expenses while we assess opportunities to rekindle our growth. As previously disclosed, we closed our Asia Pacific\noperations in 2023. Going forward, certain significant wholesale accounts that were previously served by our Asia Pacific team will be\npicked up by Australian wholesale division.\nSales and Earnings Highlights\nConsolidated net sales for 2023 were $318.0 million, down 10% compared to $351.7 million in 2022. Consolidated gross earnings as a\npercent of net sales were 44.9% and 41.1% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Operating earnings were a record $41.0 million, up 2% over\nour previous record of $40.4 million, despite lower sales. Net earnings were a record $30.2 million, or $3.17 per diluted share, in 2023,\nup 2% compared to $29.5 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in 2022.\nFinancial Position Highlights\nAt December 31, 2023, our cash and marketable securities totaled $75.9 million and we had no debt outstanding on our $40.0 million\nrevolving line of credit. During 2023, we generated $98.6 million of cash from operations, due mainly to net earnings and reductions in\ninventory levels. We used funds to pay $9.3 million in dividends and to repurchase $4.3 million of our stock during 2023. We also had\n$3.3 million of capital expenditures.\n11\nSEGMENT ANALYSIS\nNet sales and earnings from operations for our segments, as well as our “other” operations, in the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, were as follows:\nYears ended De ce mber 31,\n2023 2022 % Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNet Sales\nNorth American Wholesale ............................................. $ 250,400 $ 283,235 (12)%\nNorth American Retail ................................................. 38,012 36,694 4 %\nOther ............................................................... 29,636 31,808 (7)%\nTotal .............................................................. $ 318,048 $ 351,737 (10)%\nEarnings from Operations\nNorth American Wholesale ............................................. $ 33,288 $ 32,641 2 %\nNorth American Retail ................................................. 6,752 6,058 11 %\nOther ............................................................... 984 1,666 (41)%\nTotal .............................................................. $ 41,024 $ 40,365 2 %\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nWholesale Net Sales\nNet sales in our Wholesale segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were as follows:\nYears ended De ce mber 31,\n2023 2022 % Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNorth American Wholesale Net Sales\nStacy Adams ......................................................... $ 56,027 $ 62,284 (10)%\nNunn Bush .......................................................... 53,851 54,882 (2)%\nFlorsheim ........................................................... 87,731 91,682 (4)%\nBOGS/Rafters ........................................................ 48,969 70,572 (31)%\nForsake ............................................................. 1,318 1,718 (23)%\nTotal North American Wholesale ....................................... $ 247,896 $ 281,138 (12)%\nLicensing ............................................................ 2,504 2,097 19 %\nTotal North American Wholesale Segment ............................... $ 250,400 $ 283,235 (12)%\nWholesale net sales were collectively down in 2023 due to lower demand following record growth in 2022. Sales across all our brands\nin 2022 were positively impacted by a combination of post-pandemic retailer pipeline fill and strong consumer demand. Our BOGS\nbrand experienced the largest decrease for the year, compared to record sales for the brand in 2022, as orders were down amid the current\nsaturation of product in the outdoor market, and due to the mild weather in the final months of 2023. Licensing revenues consist of\nroyalties earned on sales of branded apparel, accessories, and specialty footwear in the United States and on branded footwear in Mexico\nand certain overseas markets. Licensing revenues increased in 2023, compared to 2022, in line with increased licensees’ sales of branded\nproducts.\nWholesale Earnings from Operations\nWholesale gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 39.7% in 2023 versus 35.6% in 2022. Gross margins improved as a result of\nincreased selling prices and lower inventory costs, primarily inbound freight. Selling and administrative expenses for the wholesale\nsegment consist primarily of distribution costs, salaries and commissions, advertising costs, employee benefit costs, and depreciation.\nWholesale selling and administrative expenses were $66.0 million and $68.2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in\n2023 was primarily due to lower employee costs, mainly commission-based compensation. As a percent of net sales, wholesale selling\nand administrative expenses were 26% in 2023 and 24% in 2022. Wholesale operating earnings reached a record $33.3 million in 2023,\nup 2% over our previous record of $32.6 million in 2022, due to higher gross margins and lower selling and administrative expenses.\nOur cost of sales does not include distribution costs (e.g., receiving, inspection, warehousing, shipping, and handling costs) which are\nincluded in selling and administrative expenses. Wholesale distribution costs were $15.5 million and $16.0 million for the years ended\n12\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our gross earnings may not be comparable to other companies, as some companies may\ninclude distribution costs in cost of sales.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nRetail Net Sales\nRetail net sales were a record $38.0 million in 2023, up 4% over our previous record of $36.7 million in 2022. The increase was primarily\ndue to higher sales on our legacy brands’ websites, partially offset by lower sales on the BOGS’ website. Sales at our four domestic\nbrick and mortar stores were down 4% for the year.\nRetail Earnings from Operations\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 65.9% in 2023 and 65.7% in 2022. Selling and administrative expenses for the retail\nsegment consist primarily of freight, advertising expense, employee costs, rent and occupancy costs. Retail selling and administrative\nexpenses totaled $18.3 million in 2023, or 48% of net sales, for the year compared to $18.1 million, or 49% of net sales, in 2022. The\nRetail segment achieved record operating earnings of $6.8 million in 2023, up 11% over $6.1 million in 2022, due mainly to the increase\nin web sales.\nOther\nOur other operations consist of our retail and wholesale businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific (collectively, “Florsheim\nAustralia”). However, we ceased operations in the Asia Pacific region in 2023, and are in the final stages of winding down this business.\nThe winddown of our Asia-Pacific operations did not have a material impact on our full year 2023 consolidated results.\nOther net sales totaled $29.6 million in 2023 down 7% from $31.8 million in 2022. In local currency, Florsheim Australia’s net sales\nwere down 3% for the year, due mainly to the mid-year loss of a sizeable wholesale customer in Australia, partially offset by higher\nsales across Florsheim Australia’s retail businesses. Other gross earnings were 62.5% of net sales in 2023 versus 61.1% of net sales in\n2022. Other operating earnings totaled $1.0 million in 2023 and $1.7 million in 2022, down mainly as a result of lower sales in Australia\nthis year.\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND TAXES\nMost of our interest and dividend income is generated by investments in marketable securities and money market mutual funds. Interest\nand dividend income totaled $1.1 million and $361,000 in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in 2023 was due to more earnings\non the higher cash balances this year. Interest expense was $529,000 in 2023 and $710,000 in 2022. The decrease in 2023 was due to\nless interest incurred as we paid off our debt during the year. Other expense, net, totaled $738,000 in 2023 and $277,000 in 2022. Other\nexpense was up in 2023 due largely to an increase in the non-service cost components of pension expense, primarily interest cost, as a\nresult of the higher interest rates this year. Last year’s other expense included a $894,000 pension settlement charge recorded in\nconnection with a lump-sum benefit payment to a former executive of the Company.\nOur effective tax rate was 26.1% in 2023 versus 25.7% in 2022. The current tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%\ndue mainly to the impact of state income taxes.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash, short-term investments, and short-term marketable securities, which aggregated $69.5 million\nand $18.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and our revolving line of credit. We generated $98.6 million of cash\nfrom operations in 2023, and used $29.9 million of cash in operations in 2022. Fluctuations in net cash from (used for) operating\nactivities mainly resulted from changes in net earnings and operating assets and liabilities, most significantly, our inventory. Our\ninventory balance was $74.9 million at December 31, 2023, down from $128.0 million at December 31, 2022. We brought our\ninventories down in 2023 to a level that balances availability for in-season orders with better inventory turn.\nOur capital expenditures were $3.3 million and $2.3 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This year’s capital expenditures included\ncosts related to equipment installed in our Glendale warehouse that automates the packing and labeling process of single pair orders.\nWith the growth of our e-commerce and drop-ship businesses, gaining efficiency in this area allows us to give faster service with\nsignificant labor savings. Looking ahead, we expect capital expenditures will be between $2.0 million and $4.0 million in 2024.\n13\nWe paid aggregate cash dividends of $9.3 million and $7.0 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in 2023 was due to a\ntiming difference in our quarterly dividend payment schedule; 2023 included four quarterly dividend payments, as our fourth quarter\n2022 dividend was paid in early January 2023. 2022 included only three quarterly dividend payments, as our fourth quarter 2021\ndividend was paid in late December 2021.\nIn December 2022, in accordance with the terms of our supplemental pension plan, we made a lump-sum benefit payment of $4.3 million\nto a former executive of the Company.\nWe repurchase our common stock under our share repurchase program when we believe market conditions are favorable. In 2023, we\npurchased 170,422 shares at a total cost of $4.3 million through our share repurchase program. In 2022, we purchased 171,397 shares\nat a total cost of $4.2 million through our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2023, there were 868,757 authorized shares\nremaining under the program.\nOn September 28, 2023, we amended our line of credit agreement. The amendment (“Amended Credit Agreement”) extended the\nmaturity of our credit facility to September 28, 2024 and has a maximum available borrowing limit of $40.0 million. Under the terms\nof the Amended Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding bear interest at the one-month term secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”)\nplus 125 basis points. The Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a security interest in our general business assets, and contains\ncustomary representations, warranties, and covenants (including a minimum tangible net worth financial covenant) for a facility of this\ntype. At December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit, and we were in compliance with all financial\ncovenants. At December 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings on the line of credit were approximately $31.1 million at an interest rate of\n5.77%.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately $5.9 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe continue to evaluate the best uses for our available liquidity, including, among other uses, capital expenditures, continued stock\nrepurchases and acquisitions. We believe that available cash, marketable securities, cash provided by operations, and available\nborrowing facilities will provide adequate support for the cash needs of the business for at least one year, although there can be no\nassurances.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not utilize any special purpose entities or other off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 2,\nthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore,\nthe determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such\ndifferences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. The following policies are considered by management to be the\nmost critical in understanding the significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements\nand the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nSales Returns, Sales Allowances and Doubtful Accounts\nWe record reserves and allowances (“reserves”) for sales returns, sales allowances and discounts, cooperative advertising, and accounts\nreceivable balances that we believe will ultimately not be collected. The reserves are based on such factors as specific customer\nsituations, historical experience, a review of the current aging status of customer receivables and current and expected economic\nconditions. The reserve for doubtful accounts includes a specific reserve for accounts identified as potentially uncollectible, plus an\nadditional reserve for the balance of accounts, determined based on historical trends. We evaluate the reserves and the estimation process\nand adjust when appropriate. Apart from unprecedented write-offs that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, our historical\nwrite- offs against the reserves have been within our expectations. Future changes in reserves may be required if actual returns, discounts\nand bad debt activity varies from the original estimates. These changes could impact our results of operations, financial position, and\ncash flows.\nPension Plan Accounting\nOur pension expense and corresponding obligation are determined on an actuarial basis and require certain actuarial assumptions. We\nbelieve the two most critical of these assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. We evaluate\nactuarial assumptions annually on the measurement date (December 31) and make modifications based on such factors as market interest\nrates and historical asset performance. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future\nactual experience can differ from these assumptions.\n14\nDiscount Rate – Pension expense and projected benefit obligations both increase as the discount rate is reduced. See Note 12 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discount rates used in determining pension expense for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, and the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2023 and 2022. We use the spot-rate approach to determine the\nservice and interest cost components of pension expense. Under the spot-rate approach, the service and interest costs were calculated by\napplying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, to provide a better estimate of future service and\ninterest costs. A 0.5% decrease in the discount rate would have a nominal impact on annual pension expense, and would increase the\nprojected benefit obligation by approximately $2.7 million.\nExpected Rate of Return – Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. In estimating the\nexpected return on plan assets, we consider the historical returns on plan assets and future expectations of asset returns. We utilized an\nexpected rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% for both 2023 and 2022, respectively. This rate was based on our Company’s long-term\ninvestment policy of equity securities: 20% - 80%; fixed income securities: 20% - 80%; and other, principally cash: 0% - 20%. A 0.5%\ndecrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $182,000.\nOur unfunded benefit obligation was $14.0 million and $16.1 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot Applicable\n15\nITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 23) ......................................... 17\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings .......................................................................... 19\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income .............................................................. 20\nConsolidated Balance Sheets ................................................................................ 21\nConsolidated Statements of Equity ............................................................................ 22\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows ....................................................................... 23\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements .................................................................... 24\n16\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders, Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of Weyco Group, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Weyco Group, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed\nas of that date as the Company did not design and maintain information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access\nand change management including segregation of duties for systems supporting certain internal control processes. As a result, automated\nand manual process controls dependent on those ITGCs were also not effective.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis. The material weakness referred to above is described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting included in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We considered this material weakness in determining the nature,\ntiming, and extent of audit tests applied to our audit of the 2023 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial\nstatements.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are\na public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\nprocedures, as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\n17\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention\nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required\nto be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Baker Tilly US, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2015.\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nMarch 14, 2024\n18\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n2023 2022\n(In thousands, exceptpershareamounts)\nNet sales .......................................................................... $ 318,048 $ 351,737\nCost of sales ....................................................................... 175,165 207,344\nGross earnings ..................................................................... 142,883 144,393\nSelling and administrative expenses .................................................... 101,859 104,028\nEarnings from operations ........................................................... 41,024 40,365\nInterest and dividend income .......................................................... 1,107 361\nInterest expense .....................................................................

NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nWeyco Group, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”) designs, markets, and distributes quality and innovative footwear principally\nfor men, but also for women and children, under a portfolio of well-recognized brand names including: Florsheim, Nunn Bush, Stacy\nAdams, BOGS, Rafters, and Forsake. Inventory is purchased from third-party overseas manufacturers. The majority of foreign-sourced\npurchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. We have two reportable segments, North American wholesale operations (“Wholesale”) and\nNorth American retail operations (“Retail”). In the wholesale segment, our products are sold to leading footwear, department, and\nspecialty stores, as well as e-commerce retailers, primarily in the United States and Canada. We also have licensing agreements with\nthird parties who sell our branded apparel, accessories and specialty footwear in the United States, as well as our footwear in Mexico\nand certain markets overseas. Licensing revenues are included in our wholesale segment. Our retail segment consists of e-commerce\nbusinesses and four brick and mortar retail stores in the United States. Retail sales are made directly to consumers on our websites, or\nby our employees. Our “other” operations include our wholesale and retail businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific\n(collectively, “Florsheim Australia”). As previously disclosed, we ceased operations in the Asia Pacific region in 2023, and are in the\nfinal stages of winding down this business. The majority of our operations are in the United States and our results are primarily affected\nby the economic conditions and retail environment in the United States.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America, and include all of our majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts\nand transactions.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results specifically related to inventory reserves, realizability of deferred tax assets, goodwill and trademarks could\nmaterially differ from those estimates, which would impact the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase\nto be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our cash and cash equivalents included investments in U.S. treasury bills,\nmoney market funds, and/or cash deposits at various banks. While we periodically have cash balances in excess of insured amounts, we\nhave not experienced any losses on deposits in excess of insured amounts.\nInvestments - At December 31, 2023, we held investments in marketable securities (mainly tax-exempt municipal bonds). All of our\nmarketable securities are classified as held-to-maturity securities and reported at amortized cost pursuant to Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities, as we have the intent and ability to hold all investments to maturity.\nSee Note 4.\nAccounts Receivable – Trade accounts receivable arise from the sale of products on unsecured trade credit terms. On a quarterly basis,\nwe review all significant accounts with past due balances, as well as the collectability of other outstanding trade accounts receivable for\npossible write-off. It is our policy to write-off accounts receivable against the allowance account when receivables are deemed to be\nuncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses in the accounts receivable balances. We\ndetermine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience and other evidence currently available.\nInventories - The majority of inventories are determined on a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) basis. LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of\ncost or market. All other inventories are determined on a first-in, first-out basis (“FIFO”) basis, and are valued at the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value. Inventory costs include the cost of shoes purchased from third-party manufacturers, as well as related freight and\nduty costs. We generally take title of product at the time of shipping. See Note 5.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation - Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Plant and equipment are depreciated\nusing the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows: buildings and improvements, 10 to 39 years; machinery and\nequipment, 3 to 15 years; furniture and fixtures, 5 to 15 years. For income tax reporting purposes, depreciation is calculated using\napplicable methods.\n24\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets - Property, plant, equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, along with other long-lived assets,\nare evaluated for impairment periodically whenever triggering events or indicators exist that the carrying values may not be fully\nrecoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its related estimated\nundiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset, a\nloss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset. There were no impairment losses recorded\non our long-lived assets in 2023 or 2022.\nLeases - We lease retail shoe stores, as well as several office and distribution facilities worldwide. We determine whether an arrangement\nis or contains a lease at contract inception. All of our leases are classified as operating leases, which are included in operating lease\nright-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We have no finance leases.\nROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the\ncommencement date for leases exceeding 12 months. Minimum lease payments include only the fixed lease component of the agreement,\nas well as any variable rate payments that depend on an index, initially measured using the index at the lease commencement date. Lease\nterms may include options to renew when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nAs our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, our incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of lease\npayments. The incremental borrowing rate was a hypothetical rate based on an understanding of what we could borrow from a\nthird-party lender, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term, and in an amount that approximates the value of the future lease\npayments at the lease commitment date.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are included in selling and administrative expenses.\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, payments associated with non-lease components, and short-term rentals\n(leases with terms less than 12 months) are expensed as incurred. See Note 7.\nGoodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired from a business\nacquisition. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of\nimpairment are present. Our goodwill resulted primarily from the 2011 acquisition of the BOGS and Rafters brands, and, to a lesser\nextent, the 2021 acquisition of the Forsake brand. See Note 8.\nIntangible Assets (excluding Goodwill) - Other intangible assets consist of customer relationships and trademarks. Customer\nrelationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Trademarks are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment on an\nannual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. During 2023 and 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $0.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively to write-down the\ncarrying value of the Forsake trademark. These charges were recorded within selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings. See Note 8.\nLife Insurance – Life insurance policies are recorded at the amount that could be realized under the insurance contracts as of the balance\nsheet date. These assets are included within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 9.\nIncome Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided on temporary differences arising from differences in the bases of assets and liabilities\nfor income tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect.\nTax rate changes affecting deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income at the enactment date. We record interest and\npenalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits within interest expense and provision for income taxes, respectively. See Note 14.\nRevenue Recognition – Our revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell our products to our customers. Sales are\nrecorded at the time control of the product is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive\nin exchange for our products. Wholesale revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product, as that is when the customer\nobtains control of the promised goods. Shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the product transfers to the customer\nare treated as fulfillment activities, not as a separate performance obligation. Retail revenue is generated primarily from the sale of\nfootwear to customers through our websites and at retail locations. For sales made through our websites, revenue is recognized upon\nshipment to the customer. For in-store sales, we recognize revenue at the point of sale. Sales taxes collected from website or retail sales\nare excluded from our reported net sales. Revenue from third-party licensing agreements is recognized in the period earned. Licensing\nrevenues were $2.5 million in 2023 and $2.1 million in 2022.\nAll revenue is recorded net of estimated allowances for returns and discounts; these revenue offsets are accrued for at the time of sale.\nOur estimates of allowances for returns and discounts are based on such factors as specific customer situations, historical experience,\nand current and expected economic conditions. We evaluate the reserves and the estimation process and adjust when appropriate.\n25\nGenerally, payments from customers are received within 90 days following the sale. Our contracts with customers do not have significant\nfinancing components or significant prepayment terms, and there is no non-cash consideration. We do not have unbilled revenue, and\nthere are no contract assets and liabilities.\nShipping and Handling Fees - We classify shipping and handling fees billed to customers as sales. Shipping and handling expenses\nincurred by the Company are included in selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See “Selling\nand Administrative Expenses” below.\nCost of Sales - Our cost of sales includes the cost of products and inbound freight and duty costs.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses - Selling and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and commissions, advertising costs,\nemployee benefit costs, distribution costs (e.g., receiving, inspection, warehousing, shipping, and handling costs), rent and depreciation.\nConsolidated distribution costs were $21.9 million in 2023 and $22.8 million in 2022.\nAdvertising Costs - Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising costs were $12.8 million and $13.4 million in 2023\nand 2022, respectively. Advertising expenses are included in selling and administrative expenses.\nForeign Currency Translations - We account for currency translations in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. Our\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries’ local currencies are the functional currencies under which the balance sheet accounts are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the rates of exchange in effect at fiscal year-end and income and expense accounts are translated at the weighted average rates\nof exchange in effect during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recognized as a separate component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a component of equity.\nForeign Currency Transactions - Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense, net, in the\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our financial statements in\n2023 and 2022.\nFinancial Instruments – Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Florsheim Australia, had foreign exchange contracts outstanding to buy\n$0.6 million U.S. dollars at a price of approximately $0.9 million Australian dollars. These contracts expire in 2024.\nRealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are related to the purchase and sale of inventory and therefore are included in\nour net sales or cost of sales. In 2023 and 2022, realized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts were not material to our financial\nstatements.\nEarnings Per Share - Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of restricted stock and options to purchase common stock.\nDiluted earnings per share includes any dilutive effects of restricted stock and options to purchase common stock. See Note 17.\nComprehensive Income – Comprehensive income includes net earnings and changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nComprehensive income is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See Note 13 for more details regarding\nchanges in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nShare-Based Compensation - At December 31, 2023, we had one share-based employee compensation plan, which is described more\nfully in Note 19. We account for this plan under the recognition and measurement principles of ASC 718, Compensation – Stock\nCompensation. Our policy is to estimate the fair market value of each option award granted on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes\noption pricing model. We estimate the fair value of each restricted stock award based on the fair market value of our Company’s stock\nprice on the grant date. The resulting compensation cost for both the options and restricted stock is amortized on a straight-line basis\nover the vesting period of the respective awards.\nConcentration of Credit Risk – There was one individual customer accounts receivable balance outstanding that represented\napproximately 18% of our gross accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2023. There was one individual customer accounts\nreceivable balance outstand that represented approximately 13% of our gross accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2022. There\nwere no individual customers with sales above 10% of our total sales in 2023 and 2022.\n26\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Measurements\nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial\ninstruments, based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts, and applies to financial assets measured at\namortized cost, including loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, and trade accounts receivable as well as\ncertain off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as loan commitments. The guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective\ntransition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to reinvested earnings in the period of adoption. We adopted this standard in\nfirst quarter of 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact our consolidated financial statements or related\ndisclosures.\nNot Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\nThe objective of ASU 2023-07 is to require entities to provide enhanced disclosures on significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is\neffective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15,\n2024. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-07 will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The objective\nof ASU 2023-09 is to enhance disclosures related to income taxes, including specific thresholds for inclusion within the tabular\ndisclosure of income tax rate reconciliation and specified information about income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public\ncompanies starting in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will\nhave on our consolidated financial statements.\n3. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes the following\nthree-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the sources of data and assumptions used to develop the fair value\nmeasurements:\n• Level 1 - unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are publicly accessible.\n• Level 2 - quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability,\neither directly or indirectly.\n• Level 3 - unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\nmarket participants.\nThe carrying amounts of all short-term financial instruments, except marketable securities and foreign exchange contracts, approximate\nfair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments. Marketable securities are carried at amortized cost. The fair value disclosures\nof marketable securities are Level 2 valuations as defined by ASC 820, consisting of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in\nmarkets that are not active. See Note 4. Foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value. The fair value measurements of foreign\nexchange contracts are based on observable market transactions of spot and forward rates, and thus represent Level 2 valuations as\ndefined by ASC 820.\n27\n4. INVESTMENTS\nBelow is a summary of the amortized cost and estimated market values of our marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe estimated market values provided are Level 2 valuations as defined by ASC 820.\n2023 2 022\nAmortized Market Amortized Market\nCost Value Cost Value\n(Dollarsinthousands)\nMarketable securities:\nCurrent .............................. $ 215 $ 215 $ 1,385 $ 1,381\nDue from one through five years ......... 3,518 3,592 3,977 3,950\nDue from six through ten years ........... 2,836 2,830 2,347 2,455\nDue from eleven through twenty years .... — — 799 773\nTotal ............................... $ 6,569 $ 6,637 $ 8,508 $ 8,559\nThe unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n2023 2 022\nUnrealized Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized\nGains Losses Gains Losses\n(Dollarsinthousands)\nMarketable securities .................... $ 118 $ (50) $ 145 $ (94)\nAt each reporting date, we review our investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is\nother- than-temporary. To determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we consider all available evidence, including\nour overall financial condition, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for\na reasonable period of time sufficient for any forecasted recovery. If a decline in value is deemed other-than-temporary, we record a\nreduction in the carrying value to the estimated fair value. We reviewed our portfolio of investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\nand determined that no other-than-temporary market value impairment exists.\nAt December 31, 2022, we also had $0.1 million of cash invested in highly liquid taxable bond funds. These investments, which were\nclassified as trading securities and reported at fair value, were liquidated in 2023. There were no significant gains or losses on these\ninvestments in 2023 or 2022.\n5. INVENTORIES\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, inventories consisted of:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFinished shoes ..................................................... $ 94,663 $ 151,370\nLIFO reserve ....................................................... (19,773) (23,394)\nTotal inventories .................................................. $ 74,890 $ 127,976\nFinished shoes included inventory in-transit of $16.7 million and $33.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 91% of our inventories were valued by the LIFO method of accounting while approximately 9%\nwere valued by the FIFO method of accounting. At December 31, 2022, approximately 94% of our inventories were valued by the LIFO\nmethod of accounting while approximately 6% were valued by the FIFO method of accounting.\nDuring 2023, there were liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities carried at higher costs prevailing in prior years compared to the cost\nof fiscal 2023 purchases. The effect of these liquidations increased cost of sales by $2.1 million. During 2022, there were no liquidations\nof LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years compared to the cost of fiscal 2022 purchases.\n28\n6. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, property, plant and equipment consisted of:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nLand and land improvements ......................................... $ 3,843 $ 3,843\nBuildings and improvements .......................................... 32,204 32,204\nMachinery and equipment ............................................ 37,296 36,820\nRetail fixtures and leasehold improvements.............................. 4,674 4,623\nConstruction in progress ............................................. 1,972 322\nProperty, plant and equipment ......................................... 79,989 77,812\nLess: Accumulated depreciation ....................................... (50,485) (49,000)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net .................................. $ 29,504 $ 28,812\n7. LEASES\nWe lease retail shoe stores, as well as several office and distribution facilities worldwide. The leases have original lease periods expiring\nbetween 2024 and 2029. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the\nlease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. Our lease agreements do not contain any\nmaterial residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe components of our operating lease costs were as follows:\nTwelve Months E nde d December 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOperating lease costs ........................................... $ 4,912 $ 5,233\nVariable lease costs (1) .......................................... 201 1\nTotal lease costs ............................................... $ 5,113 $ 5,234\n(1) Variable lease costs primarily include percentage rentals based upon sales in excess of specified amounts.\nShort-term lease costs, which were excluded from the above table, are not material to our financial statements.\nThe following is a schedule of maturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023:\nO perating Leases\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2024 .................................................................... $ 4,342\n2025 .................................................................... 3,505\n2026 .................................................................... 3,090\n2027 .................................................................... 1,976\n2028 .................................................................... 946\nThereafter ............................................................... 377\nTotal lease payments ...................................................... 14,236\nLess: imputed interest .....................................................

As of December 31, 2023,\nour leases had a weighted-average remaining lease term of 3.7 years.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to our operating leases is as follows:\nTwelve Months E nde d December 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities .. $ 4,878 $ 4,732\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities\n(noncash) ..................................................... $ 3,180 $ 7,941\n8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets as recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nDecember 31, D ecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nIndefinite-lived intangibles:\nGoodwill .................................................... $ 12,317 $ 12,317\nTrademarks .................................................. 33,168 33,618\nTotal ........................................................ $ 45,485 $ 45,935\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change\nthat indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. In 2023 and 2022, we completed qualitative assessments noting no indicators\nof impairment. Accordingly, we did not record goodwill impairment charges for any of our reporting units in 2023 or 2022.\nWe completed qualitative impairment assessments for all our trademarks, except the Forsake trademark, in 2023 and 2022, noting no\nindicators of impairment. For the Forsake trademark, we performed quantitative impairment tests in both 2023 and 2022, as we\ndetermined, in both years, that indicators were present that the trademark’s carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment\ntests indicated that the carrying value of the Forsake trademark exceeded its fair value, primarily due to decreases in Forsake's sales\nprojections in both years. Accordingly, we wrote down the carrying value of the Forsake trademark by $0.5 million in 2023 and by\n$1.2 million in 2022. The related impairment charges were recorded within selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings.\nOur amortizable intangible assets, which were included within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the\nfollowing:\nDec e mber 31, 20 23 Dec e mber 31, 20 22\nWeighted Gross Gross\nAverage Carrying Accumulated Carrying Accumulated\nLife (Years) Amount Amortization Net Amount Amortization Net\n(Dollarsinthousands) (Dollars inthousands)\nAmortizable intangible assets\nCustomer relationships ............ 15 $ 3,500 $ (2,994) $ 506 $ 3,500 $ (2,761) $ 739\nTotal amortizable intangible assets .... $ 3,500 $ (2,994) $ 506 $ 3,500 $ (2,761) $ 739\nAmortization expense related to the intangible assets was $0.2 million in both 2023 and 2022. Excluding the impact of any future\nacquisitions, we anticipate future amortization expense will be $0.2 million in both 2024 and 2025, and $0.1 million in 2026.\n30\n9. OTHER ASSETS\nOther assets included the following amounts at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash surrender value of life insurance .................................. $ 20,568 $ 19,884\nAmortizable intangible assets, net (See Note 8) .......................... 506 739\nInvestment in real estate ............................................. 1,909 1,926\nOther ............................................................. 1,291 1,278\nTotal other assets .................................................. $ 24,274 $ 23,827\nWe have life insurance policies on five current and former executives. Upon death of the insured executives, the approximate benefit\nwe would receive is $21.9 million in aggregate as of December 31, 2023.\nOn May 1, 2013, we purchased a 50% interest in a building in Montreal, Canada for approximately $3.2 million. The building, which\nis classified as an investment in real estate in the above table, serves as our Canadian office and distribution center. The purchase was\naccounted for as an equity-method investment under ASC 323, Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and continues to be\naccounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n10. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS\nOn September 28, 2023, we amended our line of credit agreement. The amendment (“Amended Credit Agreement”) extended the\nmaturity of our credit facility to September 28, 2024 and has a maximum available borrowing limit of $40.0 million. Under the terms\nof the Amended Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding bear interest at the one-month term secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”)\nplus 125 basis points. The Amended Credit Agreement is secured by a security interest in our general business assets, and contains\ncustomary representations, warranties, and covenants (including a minimum tangible net worth financial covenant) for a facility of this\ntype. At December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit, and we were in compliance with all financial\ncovenants. At December 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings on the line of credit were approximately $31.1 million at an interest rate of\n5.77%.\n11. CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION\nThe purchase price of our 2021 acquisition of Forsake included potential payments of future consideration that were contingent upon\nthe achievement of certain milestones. As part of purchase accounting, a liability of $1.3 million was recorded for the estimated fair\nvalue of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. Thereafter, the fair value of the contingent consideration was remeasured\nat each reporting period. In 2022, we recorded gains of approximately $0.9 million to write-down the fair value of the contingent\nconsideration from $1.3 million to $0.5 million. These gains were recognized within selling and administrative expenses in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In early 2023, we reached an agreement with the former owners of Forsake to settle the\ncontingent consideration liability for $0.5 million, which was paid out in the first quarter of 2023.\n12. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS\nWe have a defined benefit pension plan which was frozen effective December 31, 2016. No benefits have been accrued under the plan\nsubsequent to that date. We also have an unfunded supplemental pension plan for key executives. Retirement benefits are provided\nbased on employees’ years of credited service and average earnings or stated amounts for years of service. Normal retirement age is 65\nwith provisions for earlier retirement. The plan also has provisions for disability and death benefits.\nOur funding policy for the defined benefit pension plan is to make contributions to the plan such that all employees’ benefits will be\nfully provided by the time they retire. Plan assets are stated at fair value and consist primarily of equity securities and fixed income\nsecurities, mainly U.S. government and corporate obligations.\nWe follow ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits, which requires employers to recognize the funded status of defined benefit\npension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in their statements of financial position and to recognize changes\nin the funded status in the year in which the changes occur as a component of comprehensive income. In addition, ASC 715 requires\nemployers to measure the funded status of their plans as of the date of their year-end statements of financial position. ASC 715 also\nrequires additional disclosures regarding amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n31\nOur pension plan’s weighted average asset allocation at December 31, 2023 and 2022, by asset category, was as follows:\nPlan Assets a t De cember 31,\n2023 2022\nAsset Category:\nEquity Securities ................................................. 58 % 57%\nFixed Income Securities ........................................... 28 % 31%\nOther ........................................................... 14 % 12%\nTotal .......................................................... 100 % 100%\nWe have a Retirement Plan Committee, consisting of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\nto manage the operations and administration of all benefit plans and related trusts. The committee has an investment policy for the\npension plan assets that establishes target asset allocation ranges for the above listed asset classes as follows: equity securities:\n20% - 80%; fixed income securities: 20% - 80%; and other, principally cash: 0% - 20%. On a semi-annual basis, the committee reviews\nprogress towards achieving the pension plan’s performance objectives.\nTo develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations\nfor returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio. This resulted in the selection of 6.75% as\nthe long-term rate of return on assets assumptions for both 2023 and 2022.\nThe following discount rates were used to determine the funded status of the pension plans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Supplemental Pension Plan\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nDiscount rate for determining funded status ........................ 5.15% 5.41 % 5.16% 5.44%\n32\nThe following is a reconciliation of the change in benefit obligation and plan assets of both the defined benefit pension plan and the\nunfunded supplemental pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan S upplemental Pension Plan\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nChange in projected benefit obligation\nProjected benefit obligation, beginning of year .......................... $ 39,609 $ 52,507 $ 12,372 $ 20,343\nService cost ....................................................... 467 445 — —\nInterest cost ....................................................... 2,052 1,243 580 511\nPlan settlement .................................................... — — — (4,276)\nActuarial loss (gain) ................................................ 916 (12,028) (1,001) (3,864)\nBenefits paid ......................................................

Therefore, the accumulated benefit\nobligation of the defined benefit pension plan and supplemental pension plan were equal to the respective plans’ projected benefit\nobligations, as shown in the above table, at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIn December 2022, in accordance with the terms of the supplemental pension plan, we made a lump-sum benefit payment of $4.3 million\nto a former executive of the Company using cash on hand. A pension settlement charge of $0.9 million was recorded in 2022 as a result\nof this payment. This charge was recorded within “other expense, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nAssumptions used in determining pension expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were:\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Supplemental Pension Plan\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nDiscount rate for projected benefit obligation ......................... 5.41% 2.83 % 5.44% 2.86%\nDiscount rate for determining interest cost ............................ 5.35% 2.39 % 5.37% 2.54%\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets ............................... 6.75% 6.75 % — —\n33\nThe components of pension expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nService cost ........................................................ $ 467 $ 445\nInterest cost ........................................................ 2,632 1,754\nExpected return on plan assets ........................................

At this time, we expect that any cash contributions necessary to satisfy these requirements in 2024 would\nnot be material.\nProjected benefit payments for the plans at December 31, 2023, were estimated as follows:\nDefined Benefit Su pplemental\nPension Plan Pension Plan\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2024 ............................................................. $ 3,205 $ 568\n2025 ............................................................. $ 3,120 $ 628\n2026 ............................................................. $ 3,069 $ 677\n2027 ............................................................. $ 3,075 $ 730\n2028 ............................................................. $ 3,042 $ 882\n2029 - 2033 ....................................................... $ 14,161 $ 4,653\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of pension plan assets at December 31, 2023, by asset category within the fair value\nhierarchy (for further level information, see Note 3):\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices Significant Significant\nin Active Markets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(Dollarsinthousands)\nCommon stocks .............................. $ 16,693 $ - $ - $ 16,693\nPreferred stocks .............................. 202 - - 202\nExchange traded funds ........................ 5,129 - - 5,129\nCorporate obligations ......................... - 4,160 - 4,160\nPooled fixed income funds ..................... 5,793 - - 5,793\nU.S. government securities .................... - 772 - 772\nCash and cash equivalents ..................... 5,292 - - 5,292\nTotal ..................................... $ 33,109 $ 4,932 $ - $ 38,041\n34\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of pension plan assets at December 31, 2022, by asset category within the fair value\nhierarchy (for further level information, see Note 3):\nDecember 31, 2022\nQuoted Prices Significant Significant\nin Active Markets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(Dollarsinthousands)\nCommon stocks .............................. $ 14,170 $ 1,567 $ — $ 15,737\nPreferred stocks .............................. 235 3 — 238\nExchange traded funds ........................ 4,656 — — 4,656\nCorporate obligations ......................... — 4,778 — 4,778\nState and municipal obligations ................. — 250 — 250\nPooled fixed income funds ..................... 5,541 — — 5,541\nU.S. government securities .................... — 158 — 158\nCash and cash equivalents ..................... 4,488 — — 4,488\nSubtotal ................................... $ 29,090 $ 6,756 $ — $ 35,846\nOther assets (1) ............................... 81\nTotal ..................................... $ 35,927\n(1) This category represents trust receivables that are not leveled.\nWe also have a defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees.

The\nunrecognized tax benefits, if ultimately recognized, would reduce our annual effective tax rate. The liabilities for potential interest are\nincluded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWe file a U.S. federal income tax return, various U.S. state income tax returns and several foreign returns. In general, the 2019 through\n2022 tax years remain subject to examination by those taxing authorities.\n15. COMMITMENTS\nAt December 31, 2023, we had commitments to purchase $41.2 million of inventory, all of which were due in less than one year.\n37\n16. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nIn 1998, our share repurchase program was established. On several occasions since the program’s inception, our Board of Directors\nincreased the number of shares authorized for repurchase under the program. In total, 8.5 million shares have been authorized for\nrepurchase.\nIn 2023, we purchased 170,422 shares at a total cost of $4.3 million through our share repurchase program. In 2022, we purchased\n171,397 shares at a total cost of $4.2 million through our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2023, there were 868,757\nauthorized shares remaining under the program.\n17. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table sets forth the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\n(Inthousands, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet earnings ................................................ $ 30,188 $ 29,540\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding....................... 9,449 9,555\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nEmployee share-based awards ................................ 86 69\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding..................... 9,535 9,624\nBasic earnings per share ....................................... $ 3.19 $ 3.09\nDiluted earnings per share ...................................... $ 3.17 $ 3.07\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2023 exclude anti-dilutive share-based awards totaling 618,000 shares at a weighted\naverage price of $28.95. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2022 exclude anti-dilutive share-based awards totaling\n916,000 shares at a weighted average price of $27.27.\nUnvested restricted stock awards provide holders with dividend rights prior to vesting, however, such rights are forfeitable if the awards\ndo not vest. As a result, unvested restricted stock awards are not participating securities and are excluded from the computation of\nearnings per share.\n18. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe have two reportable segments: North American wholesale operations (“Wholesale”) and North American retail operations (“Retail”).\nOur Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of our segments based on earnings from operations. Therefore, interest income\nor expense, other income or expense, and income taxes are not allocated to the segments. As of December 31, 2023, the “other” category\nin the table below included our wholesale and retail operations in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific, which do not meet the\ncriteria for separate reportable segment classification. We ceased operations in the Asia Pacific region in 2023, and are in the final stages\nof winding down this business.\nIn the Wholesale segment, shoes are marketed through more than 10,000 footwear, department and specialty stores, primarily in the\nUnited States and Canada. Licensing revenues are also included in our wholesale segment. We have licensing agreements with third\nparties who sell our branded apparel, accessories, and specialty footwear in the United States, as well as our footwear in Mexico and\ncertain markets overseas. In 2023 and 2022, there was no single customer with sales of 10% or more of our total sales.\nIn the Retail segment, we operate e-commerce businesses and four brick and mortar retail stores in the United States. Retail sales are\nmade directly to consumers on our websites, or by our employees. Retail stores sell our branded footwear, primarily Florsheim, and\naccessories.\n38\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nSummarized segment data for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nWholesale Retail Other Total\n(Dollarsinthousands)\n2023\nProduct sales ................................... $ 247,896 $ 38,012 $ 29,636 $ 315,544\nLicensing revenues .............................. 2,504 — — 2,504\nNet sales ..................................... 250,400 38,012 29,636 318,048\nDepreciation ................................... 1,942 7 630 2,579\nEarnings from operations ......................... 33,288 6,752 984 41,024\nTotal assets .................................... 276,626 4,594 28,122 309,342\nCapital expenditures ............................. 2,544 — 765 3,309\n2022\nProduct sales ................................... $ 281,138 $ 36,694 $ 31,808 $ 349,640\nLicensing revenues .............................. 2,097 — — 2,097\nNet sales ..................................... 283,235 36,694 31,808 351,737\nDepreciation ................................... 1,969 4 512 2,485\nEarnings from operations ......................... 32,641 6,058 1,666 40,365\nTotal assets .................................... 292,262 5,460 28,898 326,620\nCapital expenditures ............................. 882 12 1,448 2,342\nAll North American corporate office assets are included in the Wholesale segment.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN\nAt December 31, 2023 we had one share-based compensation plan, entitled the 2017 Incentive Plan (hereinafter, “the Plan”). Under the\nPlan, options to purchase common stock are granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices not less than the fair market value\nof our Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. We also grant restricted stock awards under the Plan. We issue new common\nstock to satisfy stock option exercises as well as the issuance of restricted stock awards.\nStock options and restricted stock awards were granted in both 2023 and 2022. Stock options and restricted stock awards are valued at\nfair market value based on the Company’s closing stock price on the date of grant. Stock options granted in 2023 and 2022 vest ratably\n39\nover five years and expire 10 years from the grant date. Restricted stock granted in 2023 and 2022 vests ratably over four years. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there were approximately 92,000 shares remaining available for share-based awards under the Plan.\nStock option exercises can be net share settled such that we withhold shares with value equivalent to the exercise price of the stock\noption awards plus the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes. The net share\nsettlement has the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduce the number of shares that would have otherwise been\nissued. In 2023, approximately 430,000 shares were withheld, and were based on the value of the stock on the exercise dates. Total\npayments made by the Company for the employees’ tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $186,000 in 2023 and $12,000 in\n2022; such payments are generally reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn accordance with ASC 718, share-based compensation expense of approximately $1.4 million and $1.5 million was recognized in\n2023 and 2022, respectively, for stock options and restricted stock awards granted since 2017. An estimate of forfeitures, based on\nhistorical data, was included in the calculation of share-based compensation.\nAt December 31, 2023, there was $2.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted in\nthe years 2019 through 2023 which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 3.7 years. At\nDecember 31, 2022, there was $1.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted in the\nyears 2018 through 2022 which was expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 3.7 years.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine compensation expense related to stock options in 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\nRisk-free interest rate ................................................ 4.31 % 3.08%\nExpected dividend yield.............................................. 3.88 % 3.33%\nExpected term ...................................................... 8.0 8.0\nExpected volatility .................................................. 31.0 % 28.5%\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the award. The expected\ndividend yield is based on our expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our Company’s common stock in the year\nof grant. The expected term of the stock options is determined using historical experience. The expected volatility is based upon historical\nstock prices over the most recent period equal to the expected term of the award.\nThe following tables summarize our stock option activity during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nStock Options\nYears ended De c ember 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted Average Weighted Average\nStock Options Shares Exercise Price Shares Exercise Price\nOutstanding at beginning of year ........................... 1,345,369 $ 25.83 1,279,833 $ 25.44\nGranted ............................................... 149,200 25.79 143,500 28.83\nExercised ..............................................

This \"Controls and Procedures\" section includes\ninformation concerning the controls and procedures evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with\nthe certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented in the section “Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and\nProcedures” below.\nThe attestation report of Baker Tilly US, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding its audit of Weyco Group,\nInc.’s internal control over financial reporting is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading\n“Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 23).” This section should be read in conjunction with the\ncertifications of our CEO and CFO and the Baker Tilly US, LLP attestation report for a more complete understanding of the topics\npresented.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design\nand operation of the Company’s \"disclosure controls and procedures\" (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e)) (“Disclosure Controls”) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Our Disclosure Controls are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report,\nis recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our Disclosure Controls\nare also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO,\nas appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have\nconcluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our Disclosure Controls were not effective due to a material\nweakness in internal control over financial reporting, described below.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nThe Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls or our internal control over\nfinancial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide\nonly reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or\nfraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent\nlimitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors\nor mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by\nmanagement override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood\nof future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future\nconditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than the material weakness described below, there have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) during fiscal 2023 that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as\ndefined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the\nCompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide\n43\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, the end of our fiscal year. Management\nbased our assessment on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating\neffectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. This\nassessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by our Finance function.\nBased on our assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the\nfiscal year 2023. We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board.\nWe determined a material weakness existed relating to the design, implementation, and monitoring of general information technology\ncontrols in the areas of program change management, user access, and segregation of duties for systems supporting certain internal\ncontrol processes. Related controls are dependent upon the information derived from the information systems and therefore could have\nbeen adversely impacted.\nWith respect to the material weakness, our management, under the oversight of our Audit Committee, has begun evaluating and\nimplementing measures designed to remediate the material weakness. These remediation measures have or will include implementing\ncontrols, procedures, and software relating to program change management, user access and segregation of duties for systems supporting\nthe related internal control processes and developing monitoring controls and protocols that will allow us to timely assess the design\nand operating effectiveness of the new and redesigned controls. The Company plans to engage a third-party service provider to assist\nwith the remediation of the material weakness and the implementation of the required controls.\nWe believe the above actions will be effective in remediating the material weakness described above and we will continue to devote\ntime and attention to these remedial efforts. However, as we continue to evaluate and take actions to improve our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, we may take additional actions to address control deficiencies or modify certain of the remediation measures\ndescribed above. Our remediation efforts will not be considered complete until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of\ntime and our management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe attestation report from the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm required under this Item 9A is contained in\nItem 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n(PCAOB ID 23).”\nITEM 9B OTHER INFORMATION\n(a) None\n(b) During the three months ended December 31, 2023, no director or Section 16 officer of the Company adopted or terminated a\n“Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of\nRegulation S-K.\nITEM 9C DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nITEM 10 DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nInformation required by this Item is set forth within Part I, “Information About Executive Officers” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nand within the Company’s definitive Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 7, 2024 (the “2024\nProxy Statement”) in sections entitled “Proposal One: Election of Directors,” “Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports,” “Audit Committee,”\nand “Code of Business Ethics,” and is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 11 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nInformation required by this Item is set forth in the Company’s 2024 Proxy Statement in sections entitled “Summary Compensation\nTable,” “Outstanding Equity Awards at December 31, 2023,” “Pension Benefits,” “Employment Contracts and Potential Payments Upon\nTermination or Change of Control,” “Director Compensation,” and “Pay Versus Performance,” and is incorporated herein by reference.\n44\nITEM 12 SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED\nSTOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nInformation required by this Item is set forth in the Company’s 2024 Proxy Statement in the sections entitled “Security Ownership of\nManagement and Others” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information,” and is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 13 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nInformation required by this Item is set forth in the Company’s 2024 Proxy Statement in sections entitled “Transactions with Related\nPersons” and “Director Independence,” and is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 14 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES\nInformation required by this Item is set forth in the Company’s 2024 Proxy Statement in the section entitled “Audit and Non-Audit\nFees,” and is incorporated herein by reference.\nPART IV\nITEM 15 EXHIBITS, FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES\n(a) Documents filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n(1) Financial Statements - See the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data” in this 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(2) Financial Statement Schedules – Financial statement schedules have been omitted because information required in these\nschedules is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(b) List of Exhibits.\n45\nExhibit D escription IncorporationHerein By ReferenceTo FiledHerewith\n3.1 Articles of Incorporation as Restated August 29, 1961, and Last Exhibit 3.1 to Form 10-K for Year\nAmended February 16, 2005 Ended December31, 2004\n3.2 Bylaws of Weyco Group, Inc. as amended and restated as of Exhibit 3.1 to Form 8-K filed\nMarch 9, 2021 March9, 2021\n4.1 Description of Securities of the Registrant Exhibit 4.1 to Form 10-K for Year\nEnded December31, 2019\n10.3* Consulting Agreement - Thomas W.

          "content": "2 00 2 2 A N N UU A L R E P OO R T\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS\n2022 was a milestone year for our Company. Our entire Weyco team worked extremely hard to navigate supply chain issues\nand challenging market conditions and we are very proud that we not only rose to the challenges, but went well above and\nbeyond to achieve record-breaking sales and earnings.\nOur legacy brands, Florsheim, Stacy Adams and Nunn Bush, all had comeback years in 2022, benefitting from the strength of\nthe men’s dress and refined casual business, as consumers updated their wardrobes for social occasions and returned to the\noffice work environment. While the refined footwear market normalized toward the end of 2022, the category remains healthy\nand we expect to see a steady performance throughout 2023. In the comfort casual category, Nunn Bush found particular\nsuccess with its strong value proposition and technology and Florsheim’s casual boots performed well in the Fall selling\nseason. We are entering 2023 with strong range of diversified product offerings for each of our legacy brands.\nBOGS had a record year of sales, delivering on a strong backlog of orders while continuing to broaden its mix of footwear.\nNear the end of 2022, the outdoor category was saturated with product due to the unwinding of supply chain issues, resulting\nin a more promotional market. Also, a mild winter in some parts of the United States and Canada resulted in softer consumer\ndemand. Despite these challenges, we are enthused about the overall performance of the BOGS brand in 2022, and are\noptimistic that we will navigate these changes in the market and continue to move the brand forward and evolve its product\nofferings in 2023.\nOur wholesale gross margins improved in 2022, as they returned to pre-pandemic levels as a result of selling price increases\nimplemented to address higher costs.\nOur retail business continues to be driven by our e-commerce businesses, with record sales in 2022 outpacing record results\nin the prior year. Our growth reflects the strength of our platform and the appeal of our brands. We continue to invest in\nmarketing and analytical tools for our e-commerce platform, and in 2023 we are investing in our distribution center to gain\nfurther efficiencies in processing e-commerce orders.\nOur other businesses in Australia, Asia Pacific, and South Africa were also a bright spot this year. We saw growth across retail,\ne-commerce, and wholesale for Florsheim, as well as increases for BOGS via wholesale and e-commerce. A portion of the\nincrease was related to comparisons with pandemic-related shutdowns in 2021, but a good part of our success had to do with\nour team’s strong execution in 2022, including a warehouse move and opening several new stores.\nIn 2022, we increased our inventory levels to deliver on the backlog of 2022 orders and planned earlier receipt of inventory for\nSpring 2023 to ensure on-time delivery to our customers. At year end, we were at peak inventory and expect our levels come\ndown as we move through the first half of 2023. The supply chain is largely back to normal, which will make it easier for us to\nplan our inventory levels and bring product in closer to the season once again.\nDuring 2022, we drew on our revolving line of credit, mainly to fund inventory purchases. Toward the end of the year, our\ninventory purchases tapered, and our line of credit balance moved down accordingly. We anticipate the outstanding balance\non our line of credit will continue to trend downward in the first half of 2023.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, which allows us to continue to invest in our brands and make strategic decisions for the\nlong-term. We are always looking for acquisition opportunities that would enhance our portfolio of brands, and we continue\nto buy back our Company stock when market conditions are favorable.\nLooking ahead to 2023, our focus remains on investing in and developing our core brands as well as improving the profitability\nof our business lines worldwide. We thank you for your interest in and support of our Company.\nThomas W. Florsheim, Jr. John W.

          "content": "2 0 2 1 A N N U A L R E P O R T\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS\nWe are pleased with how our Company recovered in 2021, and are excited about the future growth potential of our business\nin 2022 and beyond. 2021 started out slowly, with a quiet first quarter, but demand for our products gained momentum in the\nsecond and third quarters as vaccines rolled out, and we ended the year with the highest grossing and most profitable quarter\nin our history. Our sales and operating earnings for the year nearly reached pre-pandemic levels.\nBOGS wholesale sales were not as affected by the pandemic as our legacy brands, as BOGS operates mainly in the outdoor\ncategory. Revenues declined only slightly in 2020, followed by a nice increase in 2021. BOGS’ classic weather boot styles\nexperienced elevated demand in multiple distribution channels in 2021, and we greatly expanded sales of our casual and\nlifestyle footwear as well. Our 2021 BOGS e-commerce sales in North America doubled compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn 2021, our legacy brands, Florsheim, Stacy Adams and Nunn Bush, recovered after a tough 2020. Throughout the year,\nthese brands were impacted by fluctuating consumer demand for dress and dress-casual footwear, from very low demand\nearly in the year, to very strong interest a few months later, with that trend continuing through the end of the year. During the\npandemic, many competitors pulled back or exited the dress shoe business, leaving us with a tremendous opportunity to be\nthe leader in a still sizeable category in our industry. We are also excited about our recent success in introducing products\nin the casual and athleisure vein. The level of consumer acceptance of our current casual collections would have been\nunimaginable just a few years ago.\nOur wholesale gross margins decreased in 2021, with the decrease mainly attributable to supply chain challenges in the second\nhalf of the year. Starting in January 2022, we raised our selling prices which will offset some of this margin loss, and for Fall\n2022, we will have a second round of price increases go into effect, and that is when we expect to see our wholesale margins\nimprove.\nIn June of 2021, we acquired the Forsake brand, which joined BOGS as part of our outdoor group. We onboarded the brand\nand are working to expand Forsake’s reach, both in the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. We believe we are making\ngood progress toward putting the right structure in place for the future growth of the brand.\nOur retail business continues to be driven by our e-commerce businesses, whose net sales increased 43% for the year. We are\ntrending well above industry e-commerce growth numbers, which speaks to both the strength of our brands as well as our\nexecution in this space. We continue to invest in marketing and analytical tools to build our e-commerce platform, and we are\nplanning investments in our distribution center to gain further efficiencies in processing e-commerce orders.\nDespite lockdowns in our overseas markets during 2021 that dampened our results, we view 2021 as a turnaround year for\nthese businesses. We exited our European Florsheim business and signed a long-term licensing deal for the brand in that\nregion. We also reset our Australian business with more favorable retail leases, increased wholesale sales for BOGS and\nFlorsheim, and experienced solid growth in our e-commerce business. We are optimistic that the changes made will allow for\nour international businesses to once again be a steady, profitable contributor to Weyco Group.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, which allows us to continue to invest in our brands and make strategic decisions for\nthe long-term. We have no outstanding debt. We are always looking for acquisition opportunities that would enhance our\nportfolio of brands and our Company, and we continue to buy back our Company stock when market conditions are favorable.\nDemand currently remains strong for all our brands, and we expect that both pipeline fill and strong consumer demand will\ndrive our business in 2022. We expect our first quarter 2022 volume to be significantly better than 2021, not only because\ndemand is up, but also because the first quarter of 2021 was still impacted by the pandemic. As of March 1st, 2022, our North\nAmerican wholesale backlog was the highest in our Company’s history. We have bought aggressively, especially on our core\nproducts, to make sure that we can fulfill this demand as well as build our “in stock” inventory back to normal levels.\nWe thank you for your interest in and support of our Company.\nThomas W.

          "content": "2 0 2 0 A N N U A L R E P O R T\nTO OUR SHAREHOLDERS\nThe worldwide COVID-19 pandemic impacted every corner of our business and industry in 2020. We had some bright spots\nwith our BOGS business, but our men’s legacy brands were challenging. While there were many difficult decisions made, we\nmaintained our focus on the long-term and are emerging more streamlined and flexible. After tough second and third quarters\nof 2020, we returned to profitability in the fourth quarter, which reflected increased demand in certain areas of our business as\nwell as a reduction in our expenses, as we aligned costs with our lower sales volume.\nDespite the pandemic, our Bogs business held up well during 2020, and we were pleased with how the business accelerated\nin the latter part of 2020, as consumers spent more time outdoors. Even with relatively modest precipitation in November and\nDecember across the country, demand for Bogs’ product was very strong. While we entered the Fall with adequate inventory,\nthere was a shortage of outdoor boots in the general market and we quickly sold through key programs to satisfy demand.\nWe were able replenish a good portion of these programs in order to meet unexpected demand that occurred in early 2021.\nDuring 2020, Bogs also continued to diversify its product mix, selling more lightly-insulated and lifestyle-oriented product in\nthe women’s market, while also developing its men’s occupational, work-related footwear.\nRegarding our legacy brands, the business remains challenging. While we did see a slight lift in demand at the retail level\ntoward the end of 2020, our wholesale partners reduced styles in dress and dress-casual footwear that are work or occasion\noriented. We believe the normalization of our legacy business will be tied closely to the rollout of vaccinations and people\nreturning to pre-pandemic activities; however, the timing is uncertain. While we are disappointed with the level of wholesale\nshipments across our legacy brands, there were some highlights. Casual and fashion boot sales were extremely good and\nwe also are making significant progress toward introducing new casual footwear. The pandemic motivated us to accelerate\nchange and commit to a rapid overhaul of our product mix. The new lines we are shipping this Spring as well as showcasing\nfor customers for our Fall launch, offer a fresh, more relaxed take on our brands. While we anticipate increased demand for\nour traditional dress-oriented styles in the second half of the year, we are excited about our prospects to extend into lifestyle\ncategories based on the favorable reception of new product we introduced during the pandemic.\nIn terms of our U.S. retail segment, our focus remains on investing in and growing our e-commerce business. Our e-commerce\nbusiness was up 9% for the year. Bogs drove the growth on the internet, with sales up 53% in the U.S. and nearly 80% in\nCanada as compared to 2019. As a result of the closing of unprofitable stores, we currently have only four active brick and\nmortar retail locations remaining. Accordingly, the future results of our U.S. retail segment will be driven by our more profitable\ne-commerce businesses. On a worldwide level, we continue to leverage the e-commerce platform we have built in the U.S. to\nother locations, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We have seen success, with worldwide e-commerce sales up\n18% for the year.\nOur overseas business is still down significantly, but we are starting to see signs of economic recovery, especially in Australia.\nAustralia has begun to increase the percentage of workers allowed in offices, and shopping malls and street stores are also\nseeing steady growth in consumer traffic. We have been able to exit a number of unprofitable stores as well as renegotiate\nretail leases on more favorable terms, and feel we are on a good path toward improved profitability in 2021 in Australia and\nNew Zealand. In the Pacific Rim, our business remains limited as ongoing travel restrictions have reduced store traffic. The\nFlorsheim Europe business has been unprofitable the last few years and we decided to close those operations, so we will be\nwinding down the business in 2021.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, which allows us to continue to invest in our brands and make strategic decisions for the\nlong-term. We reduced our inventory levels to reflect current demand and have no outstanding debt. We are always looking\nfor acquisition opportunities that would enhance our portfolio of brands and our Company. We continue to buy back our\nCompany stock when market conditions are favorable.\nAs we look ahead to 2021, we believe that at least the first half of the year will continue to be impacted by the pandemic, but\nwith the rollout of vaccines, we are hoping to see an improved retail environment and consequently, higher sales, in the second\nhalf of the year. With our new leaner operations, coupled with our strong balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned for\ngrowth and profitability as conditions improve.\nWe thank you for your interest in and support of our Company.\nThomas W.

          "content": "Exhibit 99.1\nWEYCO REPORTS FIRST QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---May 7, 2024---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”)\ntoday announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nFirst Quarter 2024\nConsolidated net sales were $71.6 million, down 17% compared to record first-quarter sales of $86.3 million in 2023.\nConsolidated gross earnings increased to 44.7% of net sales compared to 43.1% of net sales in last year’s first quarter, due\nto higher gross margins in our North American wholesale segment. Earnings from operations were $8.3 million, down\n21% from record first-quarter operating earnings of $10.4 million in 2023. First-quarter 2024 net earnings were $6.7\nmillion, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to record first-quarter net earnings of $7.4 million, or $0.78 per diluted share,\nlast year.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in our wholesale segment were $56.2 million, down 20% compared to record sales of $69.9 million in the first\nquarter of 2023. Our BOGS brand experienced the largest decrease, with sales down 48% for the quarter, as retailers\nreduced orders due to the current surplus of product in the outdoor footwear market. Sales of the Florsheim, Stacy Adams,\nand Nunn Bush brands were down 11%, 16%, and 13%, respectively, for the quarter, due to reduced demand following\nrecord sales growth early last year.\nWholesale gross earnings were 39.6% of net sales compared to 38.2% of net sales last year. Gross margins improved as a\nresult of lower inventory costs, primarily inbound freight. Wholesale selling and administrative expenses totaled $14.9\nmillion for the quarter compared to $17.9 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee costs,\nincluding commission-based compensation. As a percent of net sales, wholesale selling and administrative expenses were\n27% in 2024 and 26% in 2023. Wholesale operating earnings totaled $7.4 million for the quarter, down 16% from $8.8\nmillion in 2023, primarily due to lower sales.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in our retail segment were a first-quarter record of $9.8 million, up 10% over our previous record of $8.9 million\nin the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on our BOGS and Florsheim websites.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 65.3% and 66.3% in the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nRetail operating earnings were flat at $1.3 million in both 2024 and 2023. Higher retail sales were offset by increased\nselling and administrative expenses this year, primarily web freight.\nOther\nOur other operations historically included our retail and wholesale businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific\n(collectively, “Florsheim Australia”). We ceased operations in Asia in 2023, and are in the final stages of winding down\nthat business. As a result, the 2024 operating results of the “other” category primarily reflect that of Australia and South\nAfrica.\nNet sales of Florsheim Australia were $5.5 million, down 26% from $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. In local\ncurrency, its net sales were down 24%, due mainly to lower sales in Asia as a result of the closing of our Asia operations,\nand the mid-year 2023 loss of a sizeable wholesale customer in Australia. Retail sales in Australia were also down for the\nquarter due to the challenging retail environment.\nFlorsheim Australia’s gross earnings were 60.2% of net sales for the quarter and 60.5% of net sales last year. Florsheim\nAustralia generated operating losses of $0.4 million for the period, down compared to operating earnings of $0.3 million\nin last year’s first quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales.\nOther Income / (Expense)\nInterest income totaled $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.1 million in last year’s first quarter. Interest\nexpense was zero for the quarter compared to $0.4 million last year. This year included interest earned on cash in the U.S.\nand Canada while prior year included interest expense incurred on outstanding debt balances during the period.\n“Our wholesale volumes were down for the quarter, compared to a record first quarter last year,” stated Thomas W.\nFlorsheim, Jr., Chairman and CEO. “Our results are reflective of broader industry headwinds, as retailers remain reluctant\nto place orders after struggling with high inventories last year. Despite these current challenges, our sell-throughs at\nwholesale remain strong, and our retail segment posted another record quarter, which is a testament to the strength of our\nbrands across North America. Although we expect sales to remain soft through the second quarter, we are optimistic that\ndemand will improve in the back half of the year.”\nOn May 7, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share to all shareholders of record on May\n17, 2024, payable June 28, 2024. This represents an increase of 4% above the previous quarterly dividend rate of $0.25.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on May 8, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the first quarter 2024\nfinancial results in more detail.

(NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the\n“Company”) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Overview\n• Net sales: $63.9 million (down 5% compared to $67.0 million in Q2 2023)\n• Gross earnings: 43.9% of net sales (up from 43.3% of net sales in Q2 2023)\n• Earnings from operations: $6.7 million (flat with Q2 2023)\n• Net earnings: record $5.6 million (up 15% over previous record in Q2 2023)\n• Diluted earnings per share: $0.59 (up from $0.50 in Q2 2023)\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in our wholesale segment were $50.2 million, down 2% from $51.5 million in the second quarter of 2023.\nSecond-quarter sales of the Florsheim and Nunn Bush brands were up 3% and 8%, respectively, with the increase at Nunn\nBush due partly to a timing shift of shipments to a large retailer from third to second quarter. Stacy Adams sales were\ndown 10% for the quarter, mainly in the dress-shoe category. BOGS second-quarter sales were down 33%, as outdoor\nretailers continued to be cautious with orders after a recent period of oversaturation of inventories in the outdoor market.\nHowever, retailer inventory levels are starting to normalize, and we believe BOGS demand will improve as we enter the\nprime selling season for the brand in the back half of the year.\nWholesale gross earnings were 38.2% of net sales compared to 37.0% of net sales last year. Gross margins improved as a\nresult of lower inventory costs. Wholesale selling and administrative expenses totaled $13.4 million for the quarter\ncompared to $13.7 million last year. As a percent of net sales, wholesale selling and administrative expenses were flat at\n27% in both 2024 and 2023. Wholesale operating earnings totaled $5.8 million for the quarter, up 8% from $5.4 million\nin 2023, primarily due to the impact of higher gross margins.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in our retail segment, which were generated mainly by our e-commerce websites, were flat at $7.6 million in\nboth the second quarters of 2024 and 2023. Sales increases on the Florsheim and BOGS websites were offset by lower\nsales on our other brands’ websites this quarter.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 67.5% and 66.2% in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nRetail operating earnings were $0.7 million, down from $1.1 million in last year’s second quarter. The decrease was due\nto higher retail selling and administrative expenses this year, primarily web advertising and freight costs. Web advertising\nexpenses in the second quarter of 2024 increased compared to last year’s second quarter due to the reallocation of certain\nexpenditures historically charged to our wholesale segment that primarily benefit our websites.\nOther Operations\nOur other operations historically included our retail and wholesale businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific\n(collectively, “Florsheim Australia”). We ceased operations in the Asia Pacific region in 2023 and are in the final stages\nof winding down that business. As a result, the 2024 operating results of the “other” category primarily reflect that of\nAustralia and South Africa.\nNet sales of Florsheim Australia were $6.1 million, down 23% from $7.9 million in the second quarter of 2023, due largely\nto the closing of our Asia Pacific operations. Sales in Australia were also down due to three fewer retail stores operating\nduring the quarter, compared to the same period last year, and the mid-year 2023 loss of a sizeable wholesale customer.\nFlorsheim Australia’s gross earnings were 62.0% of net sales for the quarter and 62.4% of net sales last year. Its operating\nearnings totaled $0.2 million for the period down from $0.3 million last year, as a result of lower sales.\nOther Income / (Expense)\nInterest income totaled $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $0.2 million in last year’s second quarter.\nThis year included interest earned on higher cash balances in the U.S. and Canada.\n“We are seeing signs of recovery within our wholesale business, with two of our major brands posting gains for the second\nquarter, and all brands’ performance improving relative to the first quarter of 2024,” stated Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr.\nChairman and CEO. “We are pleased with these results in spite of inflationary pressures that persist, impacting consumer\nbuying. Channel inventories have begun to normalize and, while ordering patterns remain conservative among U.S.\nretailers, we are anticipating an increase in at-once business in the second half of the year.”\nOn August 6, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share to all shareholders of record on\nAugust 19, 2024, payable September 30, 2024.\nConference Call Details\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on August 7, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the second quarter\n2024 financial results in more detail.

          "content": "Exhibit 99.1\nWEYCO REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2024 SALES AND EARNINGS;\nDECLARES SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $2.00 PER SHARE\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---November 5, 2024---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the\n“Company”) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Overview\n• Net sales: $74.3 million (down 12% compared to $84.2 million in Q3 2023)\n• Gross earnings: 44.3% of net sales (up from 43.0% of net sales in Q3 2023)\n• Earnings from operations: $10.2 million (down 18% compared to $12.4 million in Q3 2023)\n• Net earnings: $8.1 million (down 14% compared to $9.3 million in Q3 2023)\n• Diluted earnings per share: $0.84 (down from $0.98 in Q3 2023)\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in our wholesale segment were $61.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 12% from $69.5 million in the\nthird quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our Nunn Bush, Stacy Adams, and BOGS brands.\nNunn Bush third-quarter sales were down 20%, due in part to the previously disclosed shift in timing of shipments to a\nlarge retailer from third to second quarter, but also due to lower demand. Stacy Adams sales were down 17% for the quarter\ndue to lower demand, particularly in the dress-shoe category. Florsheim’s third-quarter sales were up 1%.\nBOGS sales were down 18% for the quarter. While outdoor retailer inventory levels have normalized which positively\nimpacted BOGS third-quarter performance relative to the first half of 2024, BOGS at-once orders did not reach their\nexpected potential due to unseasonably warm and dry weather throughout the country. BOGS fourth-quarter sales will\nlargely depend on colder weather to bolster growth.\nWholesale gross earnings as a percent of net sales increased to 40.1% compared to 38.6% of net sales last year. Wholesale\nselling and administrative expenses were $15.1 million for the quarter versus $15.6 million last year, down due to lower\nemployee costs, mainly commission-based compensation. As a percent of net sales, wholesale selling and administrative\nexpenses were 25% and 22% in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase as a percent of net sales\nwas because many of our costs are fixed in nature and do not vary with sales. Wholesale operating earnings totaled $9.4\nmillion for the quarter, down 16% from $11.3 million in 2023, as a result of lower sales.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in our retail segment, which were generated mainly by our e-commerce websites, were $7.2 million for the\nquarter, down 5% from $7.6 million in 2023. Lower sales on our BOGS website, a result of the mild Fall, were partially\noffset by higher sales on our Florsheim and Stacy Adams websites this quarter.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 66.9% and 65.4% in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nRetail operating earnings totaled $0.8 million for the quarter versus $0.9 million last year.\nOther Operations\nOur other operations historically included our retail and wholesale businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific\n(collectively, “Florsheim Australia”). We ceased operations in the Asia Pacific region in 2023 and have substantially\ncompleted the wind down of that business. As a result, the third-quarter 2024 operating results of the “other” category\nonly reflect that of Australia and South Africa.\nNet sales of Florsheim Australia were $6.0 million, down 15% from $7.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease\nwas almost entirely due to the closing of our Asia Pacific operations. Sales in Australia were down 1% for the quarter,\ndue to the impact of four fewer retail stores operating compared to the same period last year. Australia’s same store sales\nwere up 1% for the quarter.\nFlorsheim Australia’s gross earnings were 59.2% of net sales for the quarter and 61.6% of net sales last year. Florsheim\nAustralia’s operating earnings were zero for the period down from $0.3 million last year.\nOther Income / (Expense)\nInterest income totaled $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.3 million in last year’s third quarter. This\nyear included interest earned on higher cash balances in the U.S. and Canada.\n“This was a challenging quarter for our North American businesses,” stated Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr., Chairman and\nCEO. “All our wholesale brands were impacted by soft consumer demand resulting from cutbacks in discretionary\nspending. Additionally, BOGS at-once and e-commerce performance was more muted than anticipated due to the mild\nstart to Fall. While the retail landscape remains uncertain, we remain confident in the strength of our brands, and believe\nthat each is well-positioned in its respective market for growth when conditions improve.”\nDividend Declarations\nOn November 5, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share to all\nshareholders of record on November 18, 2024, payable January 2, 2025. Additionally, as announced in a separate news\nrelease, on November 5, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a special one-time cash dividend of $2.00 per share to all\nshareholders of record on November 18, 2024, payable January 2, 2025.\n“We are pleased to announce this return of capital to shareholders,” stated Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr., Chairman and\nCEO. “Our strong financial performance over the past few years led to a buildup of cash in excess of the amount necessary\nto fund operations, capital expenditures, and fulfill corporate obligations. As a result, we are returning capital to\nshareholders in the form of a special one-time cash dividend alongside our regular quarterly dividend. Looking ahead,\nwe believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity will continue to allow us to fund organic growth, invest in our business,\nand remain opportunistic with respect to future strategic opportunities or share repurchases.”\nConference Call Details\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on November 6, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the third quarter\n2024 financial results in more detail.

(the “Company”) approved the dismissal of Baker Tilly\nUS, LLP (\"Baker Tilly\") as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Company’s engagement with Baker Tilly will terminate\nupon Baker Tilly’s completion of its audit of the financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ending December 31, 2024, and the filing of the\nrelated Form 10-K.\nIn connection with the audits of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nin the subsequent interim periods through November 5, 2024, there were: (1) no disagreements between the Company and Baker Tilly on any matter of\naccounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Baker Tilly,\nwould cause Baker Tilly to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in their reports on the Company’s financial statements for such years,\nand (2) no “reportable events” (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K), except for the material weakness in the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, as reported in Item 9A of Part II of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nfiled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 14, 2024, related to the ineffective design and maintenance of information\ntechnology general controls in the areas of user access and program change management.

The audit\nreport of Baker Tilly on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, indicated that the Company did not maintain\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, because of the effect of the material weakness, described above.\nThe Company and the Audit Committee have discussed the reportable event described above with Baker Tilly and have authorized Baker Tilly to\nrespond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm concerning this material weakness.\nThe Company has provided Baker Tilly with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and has requested that Baker Tilly review such disclosures and provide\na letter addressed to the SEC as specified by Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K.

(NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”) today announced financial\nresults for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\nFirst Quarter 2023\nConsolidated net sales were a first-quarter record of $86.3 million, up 6% compared to our previous record of $81.4 million in 2022. Consolidated\ngross earnings increased to 43.1% of net sales compared to 35.8% of net sales in last year’s first quarter, due mainly to higher gross margins in\nour North American wholesale segment. Operating earnings were a first-quarter record of $10.4 million, up more than 90% over last year’s first\nquarter operating earnings of $5.4 million. Net earnings were a first-quarter record of $7.4 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, up 84% compared\nto $4.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, last year.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in our wholesale segment reached a first-quarter record of $69.9 million, up 4% compared to $67.1 million in the first quarter of 2022.\nWholesale sales increased due to higher unit selling prices, while pairs shipped decreased 5%. Florsheim posted 15% growth for the quarter,\ndriven by higher sales of dress and dress-casual footwear, and achieved record quarterly sales on top of record sales for the brand last year.\nNet sales of our other major brands, Nunn Bush, Stacy Adams, and BOGS, remained relatively steady with last year’s robust first quarter results.\nWholesale gross earnings were 38.2% of net sales compared to 30.0% of net sales last year. Gross margins improved due mainly to selling\nprice increases implemented in 2022 to address higher costs. Last year’s first quarter gross margins were negatively impacted by higher inbound\nfreight costs as a result of the global supply chain issues ongoing at that time, which have since eased.\nWholesale selling and administrative expenses totaled $17.9 million, or 26% of net sales, for the quarter compared to $15.3 million, or 23% of\nnet sales, in last year’s first quarter. This year’s expenses included higher employee costs. Wholesale operating earnings reached a first-quarter\nrecord of $8.8 million, up 82% compared to $4.8 million in 2022, driven by the higher sales and gross margins this year.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in our retail segment were a first-quarter record of $8.9 million, up 14% compared to our previous record of $7.9 million in 2022. The\nincrease was primarily due to higher sales on the Florsheim and Stacy Adams websites. Brick-and-mortar sales also increased for the quarter.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 66.3% and 65.9% in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Selling and\nadministrative expenses for the retail segment were $4.6 million compared to $4.4 million last year. As a percent of net sales, retail selling and\nadministrative expenses were 52% in 2023 and 55% in 2022. This decrease was primarily due to lower e-commerce expenses relative to net\nsales; primarily outbound freight and advertising costs. We realized cost savings during the first quarter as a result of measures taken over the\npast year to control costs.\nRetail operating earnings were a first-quarter record of $1.3 million, up 55% compared to $828,000 last year. This increase was primarily due to\nhigher sales and improved profitability in our e-commerce businesses. Brick-and-mortar operating earnings were also up for the quarter.\nOther\nOur other operations consist of our wholesale and retail businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific (collectively, “Florsheim Australia”).\nOther net sales for the first quarter of 2023 totaled $7.5 million, up 17% compared to $6.4 million in 2022. In local currency, Florsheim Australia’s\nnet sales were up 24%, with sales up in both its retail and wholesale businesses. Last year’s sales volumes in Asia were negatively impacted by\nlockdowns imposed in Hong Kong during the quarter.\nOther gross earnings were 60.5% of net sales compared to 59.6% of net sales in last year’s first quarter. Other operating earnings recovered to\n$275,000 in 2023 up from operating losses of $243,000 last year.\n“We started the year strong, setting a first-quarter sales record and generating robust record-level earnings in both our wholesale and retail\nsegments,” stated Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr., the Company’s Chairman and CEO. “Our topline growth was driven by the exceptional performance\nof our Florsheim brand which maintained its strong momentum after unprecedented growth in 2022. Our earnings boost reflected the strategic\nmeasures we’ve taken to address the rising costs in our business. We believe our company-wide successes over the past year have positioned\nus well to endure potential changing market conditions ahead.”\nOn May 2, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share to all shareholders of record on May 26, 2023, payable on\nJune 30, 2023. This represents an increase of 4% above the previous quarterly dividend rate of $0.24.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on May 3, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the first quarter financial results in more detail.\nTo participate in the call, you will first need to pre-register online.

Net\nearnings were a second-quarter record of $4.9 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, up 8% over our previous record of $4.5 million, or $0.47 per\ndiluted share, last year.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in our wholesale segment were $51.5 million, down 13% compared to record sales of $59.0 million in the second quarter of 2022.\nSales were lower across all our major brands due to reduced demand in 2023 following record growth in 2022. Net sales of the Stacy Adams,\nFlorsheim, BOGS and Nunn Bush brands declined 17%, 11%, 35%, and 1%, respectively, for the quarter.\nWholesale gross earnings were 37.0% of net sales in the second quarter of 2023 compared to 33.7% of net sales last year. Gross margins\nimproved as a result of selling price increases implemented in 2022 to address higher costs. Wholesale selling and administrative expenses\ntotaled $13.7 million for the quarter, compared to $15.7 million last year, which constituted 27% of net sales in both periods. Wholesale operating\nearnings rose to $5.4 million for the quarter, up 28% compared to $4.2 million last year.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in our retail segment were a second-quarter record of $7.6 million, up 3% compared to our previous record of $7.4 million in 2022.\nThe increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes across all our e-commerce websites.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 66.2% and 67.4% in the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Selling and\nadministrative expenses for the retail segment totaled $4.0 million for the quarter compared to $3.9 million last year. As a percent of net sales,\nretail selling and administrative expenses were 52% in both 2023 and 2022. Retail operating earnings were $1.1 million in both the second\nquarters of 2023 and 2022.\nOther\nOur other operations consist of our retail and wholesale businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific (collectively, “Florsheim Australia”).\nNet sales of Florsheim Australia totaled $7.9 million, down slightly compared to $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2022. In local currency,\nFlorsheim Australia’s net sales were up 7% for the quarter, with sales up in both its retail and wholesale businesses. The decrease in sales in\nU.S. dollars was due to the weakening of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar compared to last year.\nFlorsheim Australia’s gross earnings were 62.4% of net sales compared to 61.3% of net sales in last year’s second quarter. Its operating earnings\nwere $276,000 for the quarter versus $365,000 last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower operating earnings in Asia.\n“Sales eased during the second quarter, after 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 exhibited record-breaking growth,” stated Thomas W. Florsheim,\nJr., Chairman and CEO. “Our results reflect what is happening in the larger retail environment, as retailers are well-stocked with inventory.\nDespite the reduction in sales, we achieved record bottom-line earnings for the quarter, as efforts to improve gross margins and contain selling\nand administrative expenses continued to pay off. As we move into the second half of the year, we face headwinds going up against last year’s\nrecord third and fourth quarter results, which were lifted by pipeline fill and strong consumer demand. We remain focused on investing in and\ndeveloping our core brands for success over the long-run.”\nOn August 1, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share to all shareholders of record on August 25, 2023, payable\nSeptember 29, 2023.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on August 2, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the second quarter financial results in more\ndetail.

(NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”) today announced\nfinancial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nThird Quarter 2023\nConsolidated net sales were $84.2 million, down 13% compared to record third-quarter sales of $97.0 million in 2022. Consolidated gross\nearnings increased to 43.0% of net sales compared to 40.6% of net sales in last year’s third quarter, due mainly to higher gross margins in our\nNorth American wholesale segment. Quarterly earnings from operations were $12.4 million, down 12% compared to record operating earnings\nof $14.2 million in 2022. Quarterly net earnings totaled $9.3 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to record net earnings of $10.8 million,\nor $1.12 per diluted share, last year.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in our wholesale segment were $69.5 million, down 15% compared to record sales of $81.6 million in the third quarter of 2022. The\ndecrease was primarily due to a 42% decline in BOGS sales, compared to record sales for the brand last year, as retailers have reduced orders\ndue to the current saturation of product in the outdoor footwear market, and due to the mild start to Fall. Florsheim net sales were down 7%,\ncompared to record sales for the brand in last year’s third quarter. Sales of the Nunn Bush brand were up 11%, with the increase driven in part\nby incremental sales in the casual and hybrid categories, and new programs with a few large retailers. Stacy Adams sales were down 1%.\nWholesale gross earnings were 38.6% of net sales in the third quarter of 2023 compared to 36.3% of net sales last year. Gross margins improved\nas a result of lower inventory costs compared to last year, primarily related to inbound freight costs.\nSelling and administrative expenses for the wholesale segment were $15.6 million for the quarter compared to $16.7 million last year. The\ndecrease was primarily due to lower employee costs, mainly commission-based compensation. As a percent of net sales, selling and\nadministrative expenses were 22% and 21% of net sales in the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Wholesale operating earnings\ntotaled $11.3 million for the quarter, down 13% from $12.9 million last year, due primarily to lower sales. This quarter was our second most\nprofitable third quarter in terms of wholesale operating earnings, second only to last year.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nRetail net sales were a third-quarter record of $7.6 million, up 6% over our previous record of $7.1 million in 2022. The increase was due to\nhigher sales across all our domestic e-commerce websites, with the largest increases at BOGS and Florsheim.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 65.4% and 66.3% in the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Selling and\nadministrative expenses for the retail segment totaled $4.0 million, or 53% of net sales, for the quarter compared to $3.9 million, or 55% of net\nsales, last year. Third quarter retail operating earnings rose to $926,000, up 12% compared to $825,000 last year, due mainly to the increase in\nweb sales.\nOther\nOur other operations consist of our retail and wholesale businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific (collectively, “Florsheim Australia”).\nNet sales of Florsheim Australia totaled $7.1 million, down 14% compared to $8.2 million in the third quarter of 2022. In local currency, its net\nsales were down 10%, primarily in its wholesale businesses.\nFlorsheim Australia’s gross earnings were 61.6% of net sales compared to 61.4% of net sales in last year’s third quarter. Its operating earnings\nwere $256,000 for the quarter versus $476,000 last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings in Australia’s wholesale businesses,\nas a result of lower sales.\n“Our wholesale volumes were down for the quarter, as many of our retail partners worked to pare back higher levels of inventory,” stated Thomas\nW. Florsheim, Jr., Chairman and CEO. “Though sales declined, we delivered healthy operating earnings for the quarter relative to sales, as\nefforts to improve gross margins and control costs have continued to bolster our profitability. At retail our e-commerce businesses continued to\nperform well, signaling the strength of our major brands in the U.S. We paid off our debt in the quarter and our cash flows currently remain\nstrong. Our strong financial position enables us to withstand changes in the retail environment while also giving us the flexibility to allocate capital\nto support our future growth initiatives.”\nOn November 7, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share to all shareholders of record on November 27, 2023,\npayable on January 2, 2024.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the third quarter financial results in more\ndetail.

          "content": "Exhibit 99.1\nWEYCO REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 RESULTS\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---March 5, 2024---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the\n“Company”) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.\nFourth Quarter 2023\nConsolidated net sales were $80.6 million, down 19% from $99.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Consolidated\ngross earnings increased to 50.3% of net sales compared to 46.6% of net sales in last year’s fourth quarter, due mainly to\nhigher gross margins in our North American wholesale segment. Quarterly earnings from operations were $11.5 million,\ndown 24% compared to record operating earnings of $15.1 million in 2022. Fourth-quarter 2023 net earnings were $8.5\nmillion, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared to $10.2 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, last year.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in our wholesale segment were $59.6 million, down 21% compared to $75.5 million in 2022. Our BOGS brand\nexperienced the largest decrease, with sales down 32% for the quarter, as retailers reduced orders amid the current\nsaturation of product in the outdoor footwear market, and due to the mild Fall and Winter weather. Sales of the Stacy\nAdams, Nunn Bush, and Florsheim brands were down 19%, 18%, and 13%, respectively, for the quarter. Sales volumes\nwere down across our legacy brands as a result of weaker demand following a period of strong growth in 2022.\nWholesale gross earnings were 44.9% of net sales for the quarter compared to 41.3% of net sales in last year’s fourth\nquarter. Gross margins improved as a result of lower inventory costs, primarily inbound freight. Wholesale selling and\nadministrative expenses totaled $18.9 million for the quarter compared to $20.5 million last year. The decrease was largely\ndue to lower employee costs, mainly commission-based compensation. As a percent of net sales, wholesale selling and\nadministrative expenses totaled 32% for the quarter versus 27% last year. Wholesale operating earnings totaled $7.9\nmillion for the quarter, down 27% from $10.7 million in 2022, primarily due to lower sales.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nRetail net sales were $13.9 million, down 3% compared to record sales of $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The\ndecrease was primarily on the BOGS website, as a result of lower demand.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 65.8% and 64.5% in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSelling and administrative expenses for the retail segment totaled $5.6 million for the quarter compared to $5.9 million\nlast year, down as a result of lower web advertising costs. As a percent of net sales, retail selling and administrative\nexpenses were flat at 41% in both 2023 and 2022. Retail operating earnings reached a record $3.5 million in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, up 6% over $3.3 million in 2022. The earnings improvement resulted from lower costs in the fourth\nquarter of 2023.\nOther\nOur other operations consist of our retail and wholesale businesses in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific\n(collectively, “Florsheim Australia”). However, as previously disclosed, we ceased operations in the Asia Pacific region\nin 2023, and are in the final stages of winding down this business. Net sales of Florsheim Australia were $7.2 million,\ndown 23% from $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. In local currency, Florsheim Australia’s net sales were down\n22%, due mainly to the loss of a sizeable wholesale customer in Australia earlier in 2023, but also due to lower retail sales\nin the Asia Pacific region as a result of its wind-down.\nFlorsheim Australia’s gross earnings were 65.4% of net sales for the quarter compared to 61.8% of net sales in the fourth\nquarter of 2022. Its operating earnings were $0.2 million for the quarter compared to $1.1 million last year, down due to\nlower sales volumes this year.\nFull Year 2023\nConsolidated net sales for the full year were $318.0 million, down 10% compared to record sales of $351.7 million in\n2022. Consolidated gross earnings increased to 44.9% of net sales in 2023 from 41.1% last year, due mainly to higher\ngross margins in our North American wholesale segment. Full year 2023 operating earnings were a record $41.0 million,\nup 2% over our previous record of $40.4 million in 2022, despite lower sales. Net earnings were a record $30.2 million,\nor $3.17 per diluted share, in 2023, up 2% compared to $29.5 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in 2022.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nWholesale net sales were $250.4 million in 2023, down 12% compared to record sales of $283.2 million in 2022. The\ndecrease was primarily due to a 31% decline in BOGS sales, compared to record sales for the brand last year, as orders\nwere down amid the current saturation of product in the outdoor footwear market. Sales of the Stacy Adams, Florsheim,\nand Nunn bush brands were down 10%, 4% and 2%, respectively, for the year, resulting from lower demand following\nstrong growth last year.\nWholesale gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 39.7% in 2023 and 35.6% in 2022. Gross margins improved as a\nresult of increased selling prices and lower inventory costs, primarily inbound freight. Selling and administrative expenses\ntotaled $66.0 million in 2023 compared to $68.2 million in 2022. The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to lower\nemployee costs, mainly commission-based compensation. As a percent of net sales, wholesale selling and adminstrative\nexpenses were 26% in 2023 and 24% in 2022. Wholesale operating earnings reached a record $33.3 million in 2023, up\n2% over our previous record of $32.6 million in 2022, due to higher gross margins and lower selling and adminstrative\nexpenses.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nRetail net sales were a record $38.0 million in 2023, up 4% over our previous record of $36.7 million in 2022. The increase\nwas primarily due to higher sales on our legacy brands’ websites, partially offset by lower sales on the BOGS website.\nSales at our four domestic brick and mortar stores were down 4% for the year.\nRetail gross earnings were 65.9% of net sales in 2023 and 65.7% of net sales in 2022. Selling and administrative expenses\ntotaled $18.3 million, or 48% of net sales, for the year compared to $18.1 million, or 49% of net sales, last year. The retail\nsegment achieved record operating earnings of $6.8 million in 2023, up 11% over $6.1 million in 2022, due mainly to the\nincrease in web sales.\nOther\nNet sales at Florsheim Australia totaled $29.6 million in 2023, down 7% from $31.8 million in 2022. In local currency,\nFlorsheim Australia’s net sales were down 3% for the year, with sales down in its wholesale businesses due to the\npreviously mentioned mid-year loss of a wholesale customer in Australia, partially offset by higher sales in its retail\nbusinesses.\nFlorsheim Australia’s gross earnings were 62.5% of net sales in 2023 versus 61.1% of net sales in 2022. Its operating\nearnings totaled $1.0 million in 2023 and $1.7 million in 2022, down as a result of lower sales.\n“We generated record annual earnings in 2023 as a result of stronger gross margins and efforts to contain costs,” stated\nThomas W. Florsheim, Jr., Chairman and CEO. “We are particularly pleased with these results despite the lower sales\nvolumes. The last couple of years have had distortions in revenues such as unusually robust fourth quarter sales in Fall\nof 2022, resulting from timing shifts due to supply chain issues. Looking ahead, we expect to face headwinds in the first\nhalf of 2024, but continue to focus on building our backlogs and are optimistic that demand will improve in the back half\nof the year.”\nOn March 5, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share to all shareholders of record on\nMarch 15, 2024, payable March 29, 2024.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on March 6, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the fourth quarter and\nfull year 2023 financial results in more detail.

          "content": "WEYCO REPORTS FIRST QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---May 3, 2022---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”) today announced financial\nresults for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.\nFirst Quarter 2022\nConsolidated net sales were a first-quarter record of $81.4 million for the period compared to $46.9 million in 2021. Consolidated gross earnings\nwere 35.8% of net sales for the quarter compared to 41.2% of net sales in last year’s first quarter. The decrease in gross margins was due to\nlower wholesale margins. Earnings from operations totaled $5.4 million compared to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2021. Quarterly net earnings\nrose to $4.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, up from $1.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, last year.\nLast year’s first quarter results were impacted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, comparisons of first quarter 2022\nfinancial performance to 2021 may have limited utility. Therefore, selected comparisons to 2019 (pre-COVID) are included in this release as\nappropriate. Net sales for the first quarter 2022 exceeded 2019 levels by 10%. The Company’s operating earnings also improved, beating 2019\nlevels by 6%.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in the wholesale segment were a first-quarter record of $67.1 million compared to $33.4 million in the first quarter of 2021, with sales\nup across all of the Company’s brands. Last year’s first quarter sales of our legacy brands (Florsheim, Stacy Adams, and Nunn Bush) were\nlower than normal because the pandemic significantly impacted sales of dress and dress-casual footwear. Sales of the BOGS outdoor brand,\nwhich have been less affected by the pandemic, rose 72% for the quarter, with sales up across all major distribution channels. The wholesale\nsegment experienced significant growth in the first quarter of 2022, with net sales surpassing 2019 levels by 13%. Not only did Florsheim and\nBOGS achieve record first-quarter sales, but sales of the Nunn Bush brand beat 2019 levels by 24%. Stacy Adams sales reached 80% of 2019\nsales levels for the quarter.\nWholesale gross earnings were 30.0% of net sales compared to 34.5% of net sales in last year’s first quarter. The decrease in gross margins\nwas primarily due to higher inbound freight costs, as the Company continued to pay premium rates during the quarter. Wholesale gross margins\nare expected to improve in mid to late 2022 as the supply chain stabilizes and negotiated price increases with customers go into effect.\nSelling and administrative expenses for the wholesale segment totaled $15.3 million for the quarter compared to $10.2 million in last year’s first\nquarter. The increase was largely due to higher employee costs as the Company’s sales volumes have increased. Additionally, last year’s first\nquarter expenses were reduced by approximately $1.8 million in government wage subsidies. As a percent of net sales, selling and administrative\nexpenses were 23% in 2022 and 31% in 2021. Expenses were down relative to sales because many of the Company’s costs do not vary directly\nwith sales. Wholesale operating earnings rose to $4.8 million for the quarter from $1.4 million in 2021, due to higher sales partially offset by lower\ngross margins and higher selling and administrative expenses.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in the retail segment were a first-quarter record of $7.9 million compared to $5.6 million in 2021. Same store sales rose 39%, due to a\n38% increase in e-commerce sales (with sales up on all brands’ websites) and higher brick-and-mortar sales. Last year’s brick-and-mortar sales\nwere down significantly as a result of the pandemic. Retail net sales in the first quarter of 2022 surpassed the 2019 level by 41%. While most of\nthis increase was driven by e-commerce growth, brick and mortar sales at the Company’s four remaining locations also collectively exceeded\n2019 levels.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 65.9% and 65.3% in the first quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Selling and\nadministrative expenses for the retail segment were $4.4 million for the quarter compared to $2.9 million last year. The increase was primarily\ndue to higher e-commerce expenses, primarily freight and advertising.\nRetail operating earnings were $828,000 for the quarter compared to $756,000 last year. This increase was primarily due to improved\nperformance at active brick-and-mortar locations. Earnings from our e-commerce businesses were down slightly for the quarter, as increased\nsales were offset by higher expenses.\nOther\nThe Company’s other operations have historically included the wholesale and retail businesses of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe.\nHowever, as previously disclosed, the Company has closed Florsheim Europe and is in the final stages of winding down this business. As a\nresult, the 2022 operating results of the “other” category reflect only that of Florsheim Australia.\nOther net sales for the first quarter of 2022 totaled $6.4 million compared to $7.9 million in the 2021. The decrease was due to the closing of\nFlorsheim Europe and lower sales at Florsheim Australia. Florsheim Australia’s net sales fell 8% for the quarter, with sales down in both its\nwholesale and retail businesses. The weakening of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar also contributed to the decrease, as Florsheim\nAustralia’s net sales in local currency were only down 2% for the quarter. Retail sales in Australia, which account for a majority of Florsheim\nAustralia’s sales, were up 7% for the quarter in local currency, but these results were offset by lower sales in Asia due to additional lockdowns\nimposed in Hong Kong during the quarter. Florsheim Australia’s net sales for the first quarter of 2022 reached 89% of 2019 levels.\nOther operating losses totaled $243,000 for the quarter versus operating losses of $481,000 last year. The improvement between periods was\nprimarily due to the shedding of losses at Florsheim Europe.\n“Our sales continued to surge during the first quarter of 2022, hitting record levels, fueled by strong demand in our North American wholesale\nand retail segments,” stated Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr., the Company’s Chairman and CEO. “We received a large number of containers during\nthe quarter which enabled us to fulfill much of the increased demand, despite supply chain delays. While the supply chain shows indications of\nimproving as inflows of product into the U.S. are increasing, we still anticipate continued headwinds in the near to medium term. Our wholesale\nbacklog currently remains very strong, and we look forward to carrying on this positive momentum as we move throughout the year.”\nOn May 3, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share to all shareholders of record on May 27, 2022,\npayable on June 30, 2022.\nConference Call Details\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on May 4, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the first quarter financial results in more detail.\nTo participate in the call, you will first need to pre-register online.

          "content": "WEYCO REPORTS SECOND QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---August 2, 2022---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”) today announced financial\nresults for the quarter ended June 30, 2022.\nSecond Quarter 2022\nConsolidated net sales were a second-quarter record of $74.4 million, up 29% compared to $57.6 million in the second quarter of 2021.\nConsolidated gross earnings were 40.0% of net sales compared to 39.4% of net sales in last year’s second quarter, with gross margins up in\nboth our North American wholesale and retail segments. Earnings from operations rose 25% to $5.7 million, from $4.5 million in the second\nquarter of 2021. Quarterly net earnings rose to a second-quarter record of $4.5 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, from $3.8 million, or $0.39 per\ndiluted share, last year.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in our wholesale segment were a second-quarter record of $59.0 million, up 41% compared to $41.9 million in the second quarter of\n2021. Robust demand fueled the growth in our wholesale segment, with all of our brands posting sizeable sales gains over last year. Net sales\nof the Florsheim and Stacy Adams brands each rose 47% for the quarter, while sales of the Nunn Bush and BOGS brands increased 25% and\n35%, respectively, for the quarter. Both Florsheim and BOGS achieved record second-quarter sales, on top of record first-quarter sales for the\ntwo brands.\nWholesale gross earnings were 33.7% of net sales in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 32.4% of net sales last year. Gross margins\nimproved as Spring 2022 price increases took effect, and due to lower inbound freight costs, as overall demand for container space from China\neased during the quarter.\nSelling and administrative expenses were $15.7 million, or 27% of net sales, for the quarter, compared to $10.9 million, or 26% of net sales, last\nyear. The increase was largely due to higher employee costs associated with the Company’s increased sales volumes. Additionally, last year’s\nsecond quarter expenses were reduced by $1.8 million in government wage subsidies. Wholesale operating earnings rose to $4.2 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2022, up 58% from $2.7 million last year, due mainly to higher sales volumes and gross margins.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in the retail segment were a second-quarter record of $7.4 million, up 20% compared to $6.2 million in the second quarter of 2021.\nThe increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes across all our e-commerce websites. Our e-commerce businesses continue to reflect\nthe strength of our brands.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 67.4% and 65.6% in the second quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Retail gross\nmargins benefited from higher selling prices and lower inbound freight costs this year. Selling and administrative expenses for the retail segment\ntotaled $3.9 million for the quarter compared to $2.9 million last year. The increase was mainly due to higher e-commerce expenses, primarily\noutbound freight and advertising.\nRetail operating earnings were $1.1 million for the quarter, down 5% compared to $1.2 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower\nearnings from our e-commerce businesses, as higher sales were offset by higher selling and administrative expenses.\nOther\nThe Company’s other operations have historically included the wholesale and retail businesses of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe.\nHowever, as previously disclosed, the Company closed Florsheim Europe and is in the final stages of winding down this business. As a result,\nthe 2022 operating results of the “other” category reflect only that of Florsheim Australia.\nOther net sales for the second quarter of 2022 were $8.0 million, down 16% compared to $9.5 million in the second quarter of 2021. The decrease\nwas largely due to the closing of Florsheim Europe, but also due to a 4% decline in net sales at Florsheim Australia. The weakening of the\nAustralian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar led to this decrease, as Florsheim Australia’s net sales in local currency were up 4% for the quarter,\ndue to higher sales in its retail businesses partially offset by lower sales in its wholesale businesses.\nOther operating earnings were $365,000 for the quarter versus $718,000 last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower operating earnings\nin Australia’s wholesale division.\n“The second quarter marked our third consecutive quarter of record sales, and we also posted our highest ever net earnings for the period,”\nstated Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr., Chairman and CEO. “These results reflect the strong consumer demand we’ve experienced over the past\nseveral months. Gross margins also improved during the quarter as price increases took effect and inbound freight costs moderated. We saw\nstrong quarter and first-half results and continue to work diligently to control supply chain costs and build inventory levels. While inflation and the\noverstock of certain categories of consumer goods have recently dampened retail demand in the U.S., sell-through data for our footwear remains\nstrong and backlogs continue to exceed last year by a healthy margin. Although we believe the pace of our revenue growth could slow down in\nthe back half of 2022, we are optimistic that our overall positive trend will continue.”\nOn August 2, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share to all shareholders of record on August 26,\n2022, payable September 30, 2022.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on August 3, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the second quarter financial results in more\ndetail.

          "content": "WEYCO REPORTS THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---November 1, 2022---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”) today announced\nfinancial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\nThird Quarter 2022\nConsolidated net sales were a third-quarter record of $97.0 million, up 57% compared to $61.8 million in the third quarter of 2021. Consolidated\ngross earnings increased to 40.6% of net sales compared to 40.0% of net sales in last year’s third quarter, due mainly to higher gross margins\nin our North American wholesale segment. Quarterly operating earnings were a record $14.2 million, more than double last year’s third quarter\noperating earnings of $6.7 million. Quarterly net earnings were a record $10.8 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, up more than 100% from $5.1\nmillion, or $0.52 per diluted share, last year.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nQuarterly net sales in our wholesale segment reached a record $81.6 million, up 63% compared to $50.2 million in the third quarter of 2021.\nWhile part of the increase was due to strong consumer demand and higher selling prices, last year’s third quarter sales were abnormally low due\nto supply chain delays which caused some third quarter orders to ship in the fourth quarter. Florsheim and BOGS posted the strongest results\nfor the quarter, with gains of 82% and 52%, respectively, over last year, leading both brands to their third consecutive quarter of record sales.\nStacy Adams and Nunn Bush also delivered sizeable increases of 68% and 50%, respectively, over last year.\nThis quarter our wholesale business experienced peak demand, and our inventory levels supported record shipments. Looking forward to the\nfourth quarter, we anticipate that our sales will fall short of 2021 due to last year’s shift in third quarter sales to the fourth quarter, but overall, the\nsecond half of 2022 is expected to outpace the same period of 2021.\nWholesale gross earnings were 36.3% of net sales in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 34.6% of net sales last year. Gross margins improved\nas a result of higher selling prices and lower inbound freight costs, as freight rates on containers coming from China declined during the quarter.\nSelling and administrative expenses were $16.7 million, or 21% of net sales, for the quarter, compared to $11.3 million, or 23% of net sales, last\nyear. The increase was largely due to higher employee costs associated with our increased sales volumes. Additionally, last year’s third quarter\nexpenses were reduced by $1.9 million in government wage subsidies. Wholesale operating earnings rose to $12.9 million in the third quarter of\n2022, up 114% from $6.0 million last year, due to higher sales and gross margins.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nRetail net sales were a third quarter record of $7.1 million, up 13% compared to $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2021. The increase was\nprimarily due to higher sales volumes across our major brands’ websites. Sales were also up for the quarter at our four domestic brick and mortar\nstores.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 66.3% and 68.4% in the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Selling and\nadministrative expenses for the retail segment totaled $3.9 million for the quarter compared to $2.9 million last year. The increase was mainly\ndue to higher e-commerce expenses, primarily outbound freight and advertising.\nRetail operating earnings were $825,000 for the quarter versus $1.4 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from\nour e-commerce businesses, as higher sales were offset by higher selling and administrative expenses.\nOther\nThe Company’s other operations have historically included the wholesale and retail businesses of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe.\nHowever, as previously disclosed, the Company closed Florsheim Europe. As a result, the 2022 operating results of the “other” category reflect\nonly that of Florsheim Australia.\nOther net sales were $8.2 million, up 54% compared to $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, due to higher sales at Florsheim Australia. In\nlocal currency, Florsheim Australia’s net sales were up 71% for the quarter, due to higher sales in both its retail and wholesale businesses. Last\nyear’s third quarter results were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related lockdowns which resulted in a large number of Florsheim Australia’s\nstores being closed for a majority of the quarter.\nOther operating earnings recovered to $476,000 for the quarter from operating losses of $682,000 last year. The increase was due to improved\nperformance of our retail and online businesses in Australia.\n“Continued demand for our footwear drove strong growth across our business lines, leading us to our fourth straight quarter of record sales,”\nstated Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr., Chairman and CEO. “The increased volume and improved gross margins also helped us achieve our highest\never quarterly earnings. Florsheim Australia rebounded in the third quarter, contributing to our sales and earnings growth. We are proud of these\nachievements, particularly in this period of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty. As inflation continues and the pace of consumer spending\nchanges, the near-term outlook for the overall retail environment remains unclear. We will remain focused on the things we can control, including\ninvesting in our business to ensure long-term sustainable and profitable growth.”\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share to all shareholders of record on November\n28, 2022, payable on January 3, 2023.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on November 2, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the third quarter financial results in more\ndetail.

          "content": "WEYCO REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2022 RESULTS\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---March 7, 2023---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”) today announced financial results\nfor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022.\nFourth Quarter 2022\nConsolidated net sales were $99.0 million, down 2% from $101.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Consolidated gross earnings increased to 46.6%\nof net sales compared to 40.2% of net sales in last year’s fourth quarter, due to higher gross margins in our North American wholesale segment.\nQuarterly operating earnings rose to a record $15.1 million, up 18% compared to $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth-quarter 2022 net\nearnings were $10.2 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, compared to $10.3 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, last year.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nFourth quarter wholesale net sales totaled $75.5 million in 2022, down 6% from $79.9 million in 2021. Last year’s fourth quarter sales were abnormally\nhigh due to supply chain delays which caused some third quarter orders to ship in the fourth quarter. BOGS and Florsheim’s net sales both declined\n14% for the quarter, compared to record fourth quarter sales for the two brands last year. Nunn Bush sales rose 18% over last year’s fourth quarter\nlargely due to strong consumer demand. Net sales of the Stacy Adams brand increased 5%.\nWholesale gross earnings were 41.3% of net sales for the quarter compared to 33.7% of net sales in last year’s fourth quarter. Gross margins returned\nto pre-pandemic levels as a result of selling price increases implemented to address higher costs. Selling and administrative expenses were $20.5\nmillion, or 27% of net sales, for the quarter, compared to $17.5 million, or 22% of net sales, last year. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to higher\nadvertising and pension expenses. Operating earnings rose to $10.7 million for the quarter, up 14% over $9.4 million in last year’s fourth quarter, due\nmainly to higher gross margins.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nRetail net sales were a record $14.3 million, up 6% compared to $13.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher\nsales on the Florsheim website. Sales at our four domestic brick and mortar stores were also up collectively for the quarter.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 64.5% and 66.2% in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Selling and administrative\nexpenses totaled $5.9 million, or 41% of net sales, for the quarter compared to $5.6 million, or 42% of net sales, last year. Retail operating earnings\nwere $3.3 million in the fourth quarters of both 2022 and 2021, as higher sales were offset by the lower gross margins and higher expenses this year.\nOther\nThe Company’s other operations have historically included the wholesale and retail businesses of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe. However,\nas previously disclosed, the Company closed Florsheim Europe. As a result, the 2022 operating results of the “other” category reflect only that of\nFlorsheim Australia.\nOther net sales were $9.2 million, up 16% compared to $8.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. In local currency, Florsheim Australia’s net sales\nwere up 29% for the quarter, with sales up in both its wholesale and retail businesses.\nOther gross earnings were 61.8% of net sales for the quarter compared to 61.1% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2021. Other operating earnings\nreached $1.1 million for the quarter compared to $41,000 last year. The increase was driven by improved performance of our retail business in Australia.\nFull Year 2022\nConsolidated net sales for the full year were a record $351.7 million, up 31% compared to $267.6 million in 2021. Consolidated gross earnings as a\npercent of net sales were 41.1% and 40.1% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Operating earnings were a record $40.4 million, up 57% over 2021\noperating earnings of $25.7 million. Net earnings were a record $29.5 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in 2022, up 44% compared to $20.6 million,\nor $2.12 per diluted share, in 2021.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nWholesale net sales were a record $283.2 million in 2022, up 38% compared to $205.4 million in 2021. While part of the overall increase was due to\npipeline fill, sales were also up due to robust consumer demand and higher selling prices this year. Florsheim and Stacy Adams delivered the largest\nsales increases, with Florsheim up $27.7 million, or 43%, and Stacy Adams up $20.5 million, or 49%, over last year. Nunn Bush sales increased $15.7\nmillion, or 40%, and BOGS sales increased $13.0 million, or 23%, over 2021. Both Florsheim and BOGS achieved record annual sales in 2022.\nWholesale gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 35.6% in 2022 and 33.8% in 2021. Gross margins returned to pre-pandemic levels as a result\nof selling price increases implemented to address higher costs. Selling and administrative expenses totaled $68.2 million and $49.9 million in 2022\nand 2021, respectively. 2021 expenses were reduced by $5.5 million in wage subsidies received from the U.S. and Canadian governments. As a\npercent of net sales, wholesale selling and administrative expenses remained flat at 24% of net sales in both 2022 and 2021. Wholesale operating\nearnings reached a record $32.6 million in 2022, up 68% over $19.5 million in 2021, due mainly to higher sales and gross margins this year.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nRetail net sales were a record $36.7 million in 2022, up 16% compared to $31.6 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher sales across\nall our brands’ websites, fueled by strong consumer demand. Sales were also up for the year at our four domestic brick and mortar stores.\nRetail gross earnings were 65.7% of net sales in 2022 and 66.4% of net sales in 2021. Selling and administrative expenses totaled $18.1 million, or\n49% of net sales, for the year compared to $14.3 million, or 45% of net sales, last year. The increase in 2022 was mainly due to higher e-commerce\nexpenses, primarily outbound freight and advertising.\nThe retail segment had operating earnings of $6.1 million in 2022 and $6.7 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from our\ne-commerce business, as higher sales were offset by higher selling and administrative expenses.\nOther\nOther net sales totaled $31.8 million in 2022 up 4% from $30.7 million in 2021. Sales in U.S. dollars were up $3.5 million, or 12%, at Florsheim Australia.\nIn local currency, Florsheim Australia’s net sales were up 22% for the year, with sales up in both its retail and wholesale businesses. Last year’s sales\nat Florsheim Australia were negatively impacted by COVID-related lockdowns that existed throughout much of 2021. Florsheim Europe was closed\nand had no sales in 2022 versus $2.3 million in 2021.\nOther gross earnings were 61.1% of net sales in 2022 versus 55.8% of net sales in 2021. Other operating earnings recovered to $1.7 million in 2022,\nup from operating losses of $404,000 in 2021. The improvement in 2022 was due to stronger performance at Florsheim Australia and the shedding of\nlosses at Florsheim Europe.\n“A strong fourth quarter capped our record-breaking year at Weyco Group, making 2022 a milestone year for our company,” stated Thomas W.\nFlorsheim, Jr., the Company’s Chairman and CEO. “Our annual sales surpassed $350 million and operating earnings topped $40 million, significantly\nexceeding our previous sales and earnings records. Looking ahead to 2023, our focus remains on investing in and developing our core brands, as well\nas improving the profitability of our business lines worldwide.”\nOn March 7, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share to all shareholders of record on March 17, 2023, payable March\n31, 2023.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on March 8, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results\nin more detail.

          "content": "WEYCO REPORTS FIRST QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\n(Milwaukee, Wisconsin---May 4, 2021) Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the quarter\nended March 31, 2021.\nFirst Quarter 2021\nNet sales were $46.9 million compared to first quarter 2020 net sales of $63.6 million. Earnings from operations increased to $1.6 million from\n$1.3 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net earnings were $1.3 million compared to $1.2 million in last year’s first quarter. Diluted earnings per\nshare were $0.14 per share versus $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2020.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales were $33.4 million compared to $52.7 million in the first quarter of 2020. Last year’s first quarter included approximately two-and-a-\nhalf months of sales that occurred before the pandemic struck the U.S. In mid-March 2020 much of the country shut down, which resulted in a\nsharp drop in sales in the last few weeks of the quarter. First quarter 2021 sales continue to be impacted by the effects of the ongoing pandemic,\nresulting in lower demand for dress and dress-casual footwear. However, sales of the BOGS outdoor brand rose 32% in the first quarter of 2021,\nas consumers continue to spend more time outdoors during the pandemic.\nGross earnings were 34.5% of net sales compared to 31.8% of net sales in last year’s first quarter. Last year’s gross margins were negatively\nimpacted by a 15% tariff on certain footwear imported from China beginning in September 2019; the tariff was later reduced to 7.5% in February\n2020. Gross margins improved in the first quarter of 2021 because the Company sold through much of the higher-tariffed inventory during 2020.\nSelling and administrative expenses were $10.2 million, or 31% of net sales, compared to $14.0 million, or 27% of net sales, in last year’s first\nquarter. First quarter 2021 expenses were reduced by approximately $1.8 million due to government wage subsidies. Additionally, wages and\nadvertising costs were down for the quarter as a result of the Company’s cost-cutting measures. Earnings from operations were $1.4 million\ncompared with $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was due to lower sales, partially offset by higher gross margins and lower\nselling and administrative expenses.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales were $5.6 million compared to $4.8 million in last year’s first quarter. Same store sales were up 32% for the quarter due to a 36%\nincrease in e-commerce sales, mainly BOGS, offset by a 5% decline in brick-and-mortar same store sales. The Company had four fewer brick-\nand-mortar stores operating at March 31, 2021, as compared to March 31, 2020. Operating earnings were $756,000 compared to operating\nlosses of $89,000 in last year’s first quarter. The improvement was due to the benefit of closing unprofitable stores and higher earnings from the\nCompany’s e-commerce businesses.\nOther\nOther net sales, which include the wholesale and retail sales of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe, were $7.9 million compared to $6.1\nmillion in the first quarter of 2020. This increase was due to 39% sales growth at Florsheim Australia, as compared to the prior year’s first quarter,\nwith sales up in both its wholesale and retail businesses. The stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar also contributed to the increase,\nas Florsheim Australia’s net sales in local currency were up 19% for the quarter. Collectively, Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe had\noperating losses totaling $481,000 compared to operating losses of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2020. The reduction in operating losses\nwas due to improved performance at Florsheim Australia.\n“As expected, sales of our legacy brands remained depressed in the first quarter as a result of the ongoing pandemic,” stated Thomas W.\nFlorsheim, Jr., the Company’s Chairman and CEO. “However, we are seeing signs of improvement, as orders accelerated within our wholesale\nbusiness late in the quarter. At retail our performance was strong due to the growth in e-commerce, and we are also seeing a resurgence in\nsales overseas, particularly at Florsheim Australia. We look forward to building on this momentum as we move throughout the year.”\nOn May 4, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share to all shareholders of record on May 28, 2021,\npayable on June 30, 2021.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on May 5, 2021, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the first quarter financial results in more detail.\nTo participate in the call, you will first need to pre-register online.

          "content": "WEYCO REPORTS SECOND QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---August 3, 2021---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2021.\nNet sales for the second quarter of 2021 were $57.6 million compared to second quarter 2020 net sales of $16.6 million. Operating earnings\nwere $4.5 million for the quarter compared to operating losses of $13.0 million in last year’s second quarter. Net earnings rose to $3.8 million, or\n$0.39 per diluted share, from net losses of $8.9 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2020.\nLast year’s second quarter results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as most retailers, including the Company’s retail\nstores, were closed for a majority of the quarter. As such, comparisons of 2021 financial performance to 2020 may have limited utility. Therefore,\nselected comparisons to 2019 were included in this release as appropriate. Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2021 rose to\napproximately 95% of second quarter 2019 sales levels, demonstrating a strong recovery to near pre-pandemic levels. The Company’s earnings\nalso rebounded, exceeding second quarter 2019 levels.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in the Company’s North American wholesale segment were $41.9 million for the quarter compared to $9.3 million in the second quarter\nof 2020, with sales up across all of the Company’s brands. Last year’s second quarter sales were down significantly due to COVID-related retail\nshutdowns.\nGross earnings for the wholesale segment were 32.4% of net sales in the second quarter of 2021, compared to 34.7% of net sales in last year’s\nsecond quarter. Selling and administrative expenses were $10.9 million for the quarter, compared to $13.4 million in last year’s second quarter,\nand $13.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. Second quarter 2021 expenses were reduced by approximately $1.8 million of income from U.S.\nand Canadian government wage subsidies. Second quarter 2020 expenses included the write-off of approximately $3.3 million in receivables as\na result of the J.C. Penney bankruptcy filing, offset by $1.4 million of income from U.S. and Canadian government wage subsidies. Driven by\nhigher sales volumes, wholesale operating earnings recovered to $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2021, from operating losses of $10.2\nmillion in last year’s second quarter.\nBusiness recovery continues in the Company’s wholesale segment, with wholesale sales for the three months ended June 30, 2021 rising to\napproximately 91% of second quarter 2019 levels. Demand for dress and dress-casual footwear accelerated during the quarter as consumers\nreturned to offices and many social events resumed. Second quarter 2021 wholesale operating earnings exceeded comparative 2019 levels,\ndue in part to government wage subsidies recognized during the period.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in the Company’s North American retail segment were $6.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $3.6 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2020. Same store sales rose 73% for the quarter, due to a 43% increase in e-commerce sales and higher brick-and-mortar\nsame store sales. Last year’s brick-and-mortar same store sales were down significantly due to temporary store closures as a result of the\npandemic. There were four fewer brick-and-mortar stores operating at June 30, 2021, as compared to June 30, 2020. The Company currently\nhas just four active U.S. brick-and-mortar locations.\nThe retail segment had operating earnings of $1.2 million for the quarter, compared to operating losses of $856,000 in last year’s second quarter.\nThe improvement was due to resumption of sales at the Company’s active brick-and-mortar locations, higher operating earnings from the e-\ncommerce businesses, and the benefit of closing unprofitable stores since last year.\nRetail net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2021 surpassed second quarter 2019 levels by 15%. While most of this increase was driven\nby e-commerce growth, brick-and-mortar sales at the Company’s four remaining locations also exceeded their 2019 levels. Second quarter 2021\nretail operating earnings outpaced the second quarter of 2019, due to the shedding of unprofitable stores last year and growth in the Company’s\nmore profitable e-commerce businesses.\nOther\nOther net sales, which include the wholesale and retail net sales of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe, were $9.5 million for the quarter,\ncompared to $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily at Florsheim Australia, with sales up in both its wholesale\nand retail businesses, as the retail environment continues to recover. Last year’s second quarter sales were down significantly as a result of\nCOVID-related retail shutdowns.\nCollectively, Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe had operating earnings of $718,000 for the quarter, compared to operating losses of $2.0\nmillion in the second quarter of 2020. The improvement between periods was largely due to improved performance at Florsheim Australia. Last\nyear’s losses included the write-down of approximately $1.0 million of obsolete inventory at Florsheim Asia Pacific, offset by $1.4 million of\nincome from rent and wage subsidies.\nOther net sales for the second quarter of 2021 exceeded second quarter 2019 levels by 5%, as the business environment in Australia improved\nin the quarter. However, recent outbreaks of COVID have resulted in additional lockdowns. Second quarter 2021 operating earnings from the\nCompany’s other businesses also beat the comparative 2019 levels, due largely to improved performance at Florsheim Australia.\nConsolidated other income totaled $189,000 for the quarter, compared to other expense of $252,000 in last year’s second quarter. Last year’s\nother expense included approximately $360,000 in losses on foreign exchange contracts entered into by Florsheim Australia.\nAcquisition\nOn June 7, 2021, the Company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and certain liabilities of Forsake, Inc. (“Forsake”), a distributor\nof outdoor footwear, under the brand name “Forsake.” The principal assets acquired were inventory, accounts receivable, and intellectual\nproperty, including the Forsake brand name. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $2.6 million, plus contingent payments to be paid\nannually over a period of five years, depending on Forsake achieving certain performance measures. The Company’s estimate of the discounted\nfair value of the contingent payments is approximately $1.4 million in total. The transaction was funded with the Company’s available cash.\n“We experienced a resurgence in sales during the quarter in all areas of our business following the disruption from COVID-19 last year,” stated\nThomas W. Florsheim, Jr., Chairman and CEO. “Not only did sales return to near pre-pandemic levels, but earnings surpassed 2019 due largely\nto the strategic measures taken last year to cut costs and improve profitability. While the pandemic continues to impact our business to varying\ndegrees, we are excited by these results and our improved trajectory. With regard to Forsake, we are looking forward to integrating a new outdoor\ncasual footwear brand into our portfolio here at Weyco, and are excited about the growth potential of this brand, particularly through the e-\ncommerce channel.”\nOn August 3, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share to all shareholders of record on August 27,\n2021, payable September 30, 2021.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on August 4, 2021, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the second quarter financial results in more\ndetail.

          "content": "WEYCO REPORTS THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---November 2, 2021---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”) today announced\nfinancial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.\nNet sales for the third quarter of 2021 were $61.8 million compared to third quarter 2020 net sales of $53.2 million. Operating earnings were $6.7\nmillion for the quarter compared to operating losses of $3.8 million in last year’s third quarter. Net earnings rose to $5.1 million, or $0.52 per\ndiluted share, from net losses of $5.9 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2020.\nLast year’s third quarter operating results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and included non-recurring charges totaling\n$7.4 million. As such, comparisons of 2021 financial performance to 2020 may have limited utility. Therefore, selected comparisons to 2019 are\nincluded in this release as appropriate. Net sales for the third quarter of 2021 rose to approximately 75% of third quarter 2019 sales levels.\nConsolidated operating earnings for the quarter recovered to 80% of 2019 levels.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in the Company’s North American wholesale segment were $50.2 million for the quarter compared to $44.0 million in the third quarter\nof 2020, with sales up across all of the Company’s legacy brands (Florsheim, Stacy Adams, and Nunn Bush). Last year’s third quarter sales of\nthe legacy brands were down significantly as a result of the pandemic. Sales of the BOGS outdoor brand fell 8% for the quarter mainly due to\nproduction and shipping delays from our manufacturers in Asia.\nGross earnings for the North American wholesale segment were 34.6% of net sales in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 35.7% of net sales\nin last year’s third quarter. The decrease in gross margins was primarily due to higher inbound freight costs. Additionally, last year’s gross\nearnings included $500,000 in non-recurring charges. Selling and administrative expenses were $11.3 million for the quarter, compared to $13.0\nmillion in last year’s third quarter, and $14.9 million in 2019. Third quarter 2021 expenses were reduced by approximately $1.9 million of wage\nsubsidies received from the U.S. and Canadian governments. Third quarter 2020 expenses included $1.5 million in non-recurring charges.\nWholesale operating earnings rose to $6.0 million in the third quarter of 2021, up from operating earnings of $2.8 million in last year’s third\nquarter, due mainly to higher sales and lower selling and administrative expenses.\nAt wholesale, there was a significant pickup in demand across all of the Company’s brands during the quarter. However, bottlenecks in the\nsupply chain caused delays in the delivery of merchandise from our suppliers, which negatively impacted our third quarter shipments. In October,\nwe began to see improvement in the rate of deliveries from our suppliers, which we expect will continue through the fourth quarter, and which\nshould help us meet the increased demand for our products.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in the Company’s North American retail segment were $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, up from $4.4 million in the third quarter\nof 2020. Same store sales rose 49% for the quarter, due to a 33% increase in e-commerce sales and higher brick-and-mortar sales. Last year’s\nbrick-and-mortar same store sales were down significantly as a result of the pandemic. The Company closed three unprofitable retail stores in\nthe third quarter of 2020, and currently has just four active U.S. brick-and-mortar locations.\nThe retail segment had operating earnings of $1.4 million for the quarter, compared to operating losses of $2.8 million in last year’s third quarter.\nLast year’s third quarter losses included $2.6 million in non-recurring charges. The improvement in 2021 was due to the benefit of closing\nunprofitable stores, improved performance at active brick-and-mortar locations, and higher e-commerce earnings.\nRetail net sales for the third quarter of 2021 exceeded third quarter 2019 levels by 22%. While most of this increase was driven by e-commerce\ngrowth, brick-and-mortar sales at the Company’s four remaining locations also exceeded their 2019 levels. Third quarter 2021 retail operating\nearnings significantly outpaced the third quarter of 2019, due primarily to growth in the Company’s more profitable e-commerce businesses and\nthe shedding of unprofitable stores last year.\nOther\nOther net sales, which include the wholesale and retail net sales of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe, were $5.3 million for the quarter,\ncompared to $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $9.5 million in the 2019 period. The 2021 increase was at Florsheim Australia, with\nsales up in both its wholesale and retail businesses, partially offset by lower sales at Florsheim Europe, as the Company is in the final stages of\nwinding down this business. Last year’s third quarter sales were down significantly as a result of COVID-related retail shutdowns.\nCollectively, Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe had operating losses of $682,000 for the quarter, compared to operating losses of $3.8\nmillion in the third quarter of 2020, and operating losses of $1.4 million in the 2019 period. Last year’s third quarter losses included $2.8 million\nin non-recurring charges. The improvement in 2021 compared to 2019 was largely due to improved performance at Florsheim Australia.\nBusiness recovery in Australia has been hindered by a large number of Florsheim Australia’s retail stores being closed for a majority of the\nquarter due to lockdowns imposed in New South Wales and Victoria. Stores in New South Wales have begun to reopen in October, and we\ncurrently expect that all of our stores in Australia will be allowed to reopen during the fourth quarter, unless there are adverse COVID-19\ndevelopments there.\nConsolidated provision for income taxes totaled $1.9 million for the quarter compared to $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. Last year’s tax\nprovision included $2.0 million of tax expense related to deferred tax assets of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.\n“We are excited about the trajectory of our business, as we are seeing strong demand across all of our brands,” stated Thomas W. Florsheim,\nJr., Chairman and CEO. “Our wholesale business posted solid results for the third quarter despite being challenged by supply chain delays, and\nour retail segment achieved record sales and earnings, largely driven by e-commerce growth. So far in the fourth quarter, we’ve seen a vast\nimprovement in the flow of our products into the U.S., which will enable us to fulfill much of the increased demand through the end of the year\nand into 2022.”\nOn November 2, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share to all shareholders of record on November\n29, 2021, payable on December 31, 2021.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on November 3, 2021, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the third quarter financial results in more\ndetail.

          "content": "WEYCO REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2021 RESULTS\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin---March 8, 2022---Weyco Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WEYS) (“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company”) today announced financial results\nfor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021.\nFourth Quarter 2021\nConsolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of 2021 were a record $101.4 million compared to fourth quarter 2020 net sales of $62.0 million.\nConsolidated gross earnings were 40.2% of net sales for the quarter compared to 44.5% of net sales in last year’s fourth quarter. The decrease in\ngross margins was largely due to lower wholesale margins partially offset by higher margins in the Company’s other businesses. Operating earnings\ntotaled $12.8 million compared to $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Quarterly net earnings rose to a record $10.3 million, or $1.07 per diluted\nshare, up from $5.1 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, last year.\nLast year’s fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, comparisons of 2021 financial performance to 2020\nmay have limited utility. Therefore, selected comparisons to 2019 are included in this release as appropriate. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2021\nexceeded fourth quarter 2019 by 17%. The Company’s operating earnings also improved, beating fourth quarter 2019 levels by 11%.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nNet sales in the wholesale segment were $79.9 million compared to $46.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, with sales up across all of the Company’s\nbrands. Last year’s fourth quarter sales of the Company’s legacy brands (Florsheim, Stacy Adams and Nunn Bush) were lower than normal because\nthe pandemic significantly impacted sales of dress and dress-casual footwear. Sales of the BOGS outdoor brand, which were less affected by the\npandemic in 2020, rose 29%, with sales up across most distribution categories.\nThe wholesale segment experienced significant growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, with net sales surpassing 2019 levels by 16%. Not only did\nFlorsheim and BOGS achieve record fourth-quarter sales, but sales of the Stacy Adams and Nunn Bush brands rebounded to near pre-pandemic\nlevels. While part of the sales increase can be attributed to some third quarter orders shipping in the fourth quarter due to delays in the supply chain,\nthe Company did experience strong demand across all of its brands, as consumers continued to participate in normal activities and retailers worked to\nrestock shelves.\nWholesale gross earnings were 33.7% of net sales for the quarter compared to 39.6% of net sales in last year’s fourth quarter. The decrease in gross\nmargins in 2021 was primarily due to higher inbound freight costs, as the Company paid premium rates during the quarter. Management believes that\ngross margins will improve in mid to late 2022 as the supply chain stabilizes and as negotiated price increases with our customers go into effect.\nOperating earnings rose to $9.4 million for the quarter up from $5.6 million in 2020, due to higher sales partially offset by lower gross margins. Operating\nearnings reached 87% of the 2019 level.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nNet sales in the retail segment were $13.5 million compared to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Same store sales rose 57%, due to a 52%\nincrease in e-commerce sales (with sales up on all brands’ websites) and higher brick-and-mortar sales. Last year’s brick-and-mortar sales were down\nsignificantly as a result of the pandemic. The Company closed three unprofitable retail stores in the third quarter of 2020 and one in the first quarter of\n2021, and currently has just four active U.S. brick-and-mortar locations.\nRetail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 66.2% and 66.7% in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Retail operating earnings\nrose to $3.3 million for the quarter from $2.7 million last year, with earnings up at both the Company’s brick-and-mortar locations and in e-commerce.\nThe retail segment posted its highest-ever quarterly sales and operating earnings results in the fourth quarter of 2021, significantly outpacing the\ncomparative 2019 levels by 48% and 116%, respectively. While most of the sales increase was driven by e-commerce growth, brick-and-mortar sales\nat the Company’s remaining locations also surpassed 2019 levels.\nOther\nOther net sales, which includes the wholesale and retail net sales of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe, were $8.0 million compared to $7.1\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The 2021 increase was at Florsheim Australia, with sales up in both its retail and wholesale businesses, partially\noffset by lower sales at Florsheim Europe, as the Company is in the final stages of winding down Florsheim Europe.\nGross earnings in the Company’s other businesses were 61.1% of net sales for the quarter compared to 48.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter of\n2020. Collectively, Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe had operating earnings totaling $41,000 versus operating losses of $393,000 last year.\nThe improvement between periods was primarily due to lower operating losses at Florsheim Europe.\nOther net sales for the fourth quarter of 2021 reached 88% of 2019 levels, with Florsheim Australia beating 2019 levels, offset by lower sales at\nFlorsheim Europe. Lockdowns imposed in Australia were lifted, which allowed us to reopen all of Florsheim Australia’s retail stores during the quarter.\nFull Year 2021\nConsolidated net sales for the full year totaled $267.6 million compared to $195.4 million in 2020. Consolidated gross earnings as a percent of net\nsales were 40.1% and 40.2% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Operating earnings rose to $25.7 million up from operating losses of $7.6 million last\nyear. Net earnings were $20.6 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, in 2021, compared to net losses of $8.5 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in 2020.\nThe Company’s 2020 results were significantly impacted by the pandemic, due to most brick-and-mortar retailers being closed for a majority of the\nsecond quarter and an overall decrease in consumer demand. Additionally, last year’s operating results included non-recurring charges totaling $11.9\nmillion.\nConsolidated net sales for the year-ended December 31, 2021 recovered to 88% of 2019 levels and operating earnings reached 95% of 2019 levels.\nNorth American Wholesale Segment\nWholesale net sales were $205.4 million in 2021 compared to $152.2 million in 2020, with sales up across all brands. Last year’s sales of our legacy\nbrands were down significantly as a result of the pandemic. Sales of the BOGS outdoor brand rose 17%, with sales up across most distribution\ncategories.\nWholesale gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 33.8% in 2021 and 35.5% in 2020. The decrease in gross margins in 2021 was largely due\nto higher inbound freight costs, as previously described. Selling and administrative expenses were $49.9 million, or 24% of net sales, in 2021, versus\n$53.1 million, or 35% of net sales, in 2020. 2021 expenses included income of $5.5 million in wage subsidies received from the U.S. and Canadian\ngovernments, and expense of $1.1 million to write-off certain assets related to the closing of Florsheim Europe. 2020 wholesale expenses included\n$4.8 million in non-recurring charges. Wholesale operating earnings rose to $19.5 million in 2021 from $975,000 in 2020, due mainly to higher sales.\n2021 wholesale sales and operating earnings rose to 85% and 70% of 2019 levels, respectively. Business recovery was sluggish in early 2021 with\nthe first quarter still being significantly impacted by the pandemic, but operations improved after Covid vaccinations were rolled out in the second\nquarter.\nNorth American Retail Segment\nRetail net sales were $31.6 million in 2021 and $21.5 million in 2020. Same store sales rose 53%, due to a 43% increase in e-commerce sales (with\nsales up on all brands’ websites) and higher brick-and-mortar same store sales.\nFor the year, retail gross earnings rose to 66.4% of net sales in 2021 from 64.8% of net sales in 2020, with gross margins up at active brick-and-mortar\nlocations and in e-commerce. The retail segment had operating earnings of $6.7 million in 2021 compared to operating losses of $1.1 million in 2020.\nLast year’s losses included $2.6 million in non-recurring charges. The improvement in 2021 was due to the benefit of closing unprofitable stores, higher\ne-commerce earnings, and improved performance at active brick-and-mortar locations.\n2021 retail sales and operating earnings surpassed 2019 levels by 25% and 138%, respectively. The increases were primarily due to growth in the\nCompany’s more profitable e-commerce businesses.\nOther\nThe Company’s other businesses had combined net sales of $30.7 million in 2021 compared to $21.7 million in 2020. The increase was at Florsheim\nAustralia, with sales up in both its retail and wholesale businesses. For the year, other net sales amounted to 84% of 2019 levels, with Florsheim\nAustralia reaching 93% of 2019 levels, offset by lower sales at Florsheim Europe, which is being wound down.\nGross earnings in the Company’s other businesses were 55.8% of net sales in 2021 versus 48.8% of net sales in 2020. Collectively, Florsheim Australia\nand Florsheim Europe had operating losses totaling $404,000 in 2021 compared to operating losses of $7.5 million and $3.5 million in 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. Despite the lockdowns that existed throughout much of 2021, Florsheim Australia had operating earnings of $118,000 resulting from\nimproved gross margins and cost reductions. Last year’s losses included $4.5 million in non-recurring charges. The improvement in 2021 was primarily\ndue to the stronger results at Florsheim Australia.\n“We are proud, as a Company, to have topped more than $100 million in sales and $10 million in net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021, making it\nthe highest grossing and most profitable quarter in Weyco’s history,” stated Thomas W. Florsheim, Jr., the Company’s Chairman and CEO. “We could\nnot have achieved this milestone without the tremendous efforts of our corporate and distribution employees worldwide. We are also excited by the\nturnaround at Florsheim Australia. Its new leaner cost structure should enable us to be more profitable in the future. Looking back at the full year, we\nare very pleased with how our business has recovered from the pandemic, despite supply chain headwinds. While we expect these challenges to\ncontinue to impact us at least through the first part of 2022, we look forward to carrying this positive momentum well into next year.”\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share to all shareholders of record on March 18,\n2022, payable March 31, 2022.\nConference Call Details:\nWeyco Group will host a conference call on March 9, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results\nin more detail.
