(Nasdaq: ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023 and provided a corporate update.\n\n“Our third quarter results represent another period of significant CAPLYTA growth, and we are again increasing our revenue guidance for the full year 2023,” said Dr. Sharon Mates, Chairman and CEO of Intra-Cellular Therapies. “We continue to solidify CAPLYTA's position as an important option in the treatment of bipolar depression and schizophrenia and we remain focused on advancing our pipeline, including additional lumateperone development programs.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights:**\n\nTotal revenues were $126.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $71.9 million for the same period in 2022. Net product sales of CAPLYTA were $125.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $71.9 million for the same period in 2022, representing a year-over-year increase of 75% and a 14% sequential increase over the second quarter of 2023.\n\n  * Net loss for the third quarter of 2023 was $24.3 million compared to a net loss of $53.5 million for the same period in 2022.\n  * Cost of product sales was $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2022. \n  * Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $105.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $88.4 million for the same period in 2022. \n  * Research and development (R&D) expenses were $41.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $33.3 million for the same period in 2022. \n  * Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investment securities totaled $494.8 million at September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**Fiscal 2023 Financial Outlook:**\n\n  * Full year 2023 CAPLYTA net product sales guidance increased to $460 to $470 million from the previous range of $445 to $465 million. \n  * Full year 2023 SG&A expense guidance lowered to $405 to $420 million and R&D expense guidance lowered to $185 to $200 million.\n\n\n\n**CLINICAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\nLumateperone: \n\n  * Adjunctive Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) program: Studies 501, 502 and 505, our global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating lumateperone 42 mg as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD are ongoing. We expect to report topline results from Study 501 and from Study 502 in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively. Subject to the results of these studies, we anticipate filing a supplemental NDA in the second half of 2024. \n  * Mixed Features program: We presented results from Study 403 at the 2023 Psych Congress and at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress.In this study, lumateperone 42mg was statistically significant on the primary endpoint of symptom reduction on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for the combined mixed features patient population of MDD and bipolar depression and the individual patient populations of MDD with mixed features and bipolar depression with mixed features. The robust effect sizes ranged from 0.64 to 0.67. Lumateperone was generally safe and well tolerated, with a side effect profile consistent with prior trials. There were no notable changes in weight, body mass index or waist circumference and no clinically relevant changes in metabolic parameters.We plan to continue presenting analyses from Study 403 at upcoming medical conferences including a post-hoc analysis evaluating the antidepressant effects of lumateperone in a pre-specified patient population with mixed features exhibiting anxious distress, commonly known as anxious depression.\n\n\n  * Lumateperone Long Acting Injectable (LAI) formulation: We have completed the pre-clinical development of an LAI formulation, and we have conducted a Phase 1 single ascending dose study with this formulation. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 single ascending dose study with four additional formulations in the first half of 2024. The goal of the program is to develop LAI formulations that are effective, safe, and well-tolerated with treatment durations of one month or longer. \n\n\n\nOther pipeline programs:\n\n  * ITI-1284-ODT-SL program: ITI-1284 is a deuterated form of lumateperone, a new chemical entity formulated as an oral disintegrating tablet for sublingual administration. We have initiated Phase 2 programs evaluating ITI-1284 in generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease, and agitation in Alzheimer’s disease. \n  * Phosphodiesterase type I inhibitor (PDE1) program: We continue to develop our portfolio of PDE1 inhibitors:Lenrispodun (ITI-214) Parkinson’s disease (PD) program: Patient enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing. The objective of this study is to evaluate improvements in motor symptoms in patients with PD. Changes in cognition and inflammatory biomarkers are also being assessed.ITI-1020 cancer immunotherapy program: Our Phase 1 single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers is ongoing. The objective of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of different doses of ITI-1020.\n\n\n  * ITI-333 program: ITI-333, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and μ-opioid receptor partial agonist, provides potential utility in the treatment of opioid use disorder and pain. A multiple ascending dose study and a positron emission tomography (PET) study are ongoing. \n  * ITI-1500 Non-Hallucinogenic Psychedelic Program: Our lead product candidate in this program, ITI-1549, continues to advance through IND enabling studies. This program is focused on the development of novel non-hallucinogenic psychedelics for the treatment of mood, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric disorders without the liabilities of known psychedelics, including the hallucinogenic potential and risk for cardiac valvular pathologies. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details**\n\nThe Company will host a live conference call and webcast today at 8:30 AM Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial results and provide a corporate update.

CAPLYTA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.**\n  * **Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adults in short-term studies. All antidepressant-treated patients should be closely monitored for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The safety and effectiveness of CAPLYTA have not been established in pediatric patients.**\n\n\n\n**Contraindications:** CAPLYTA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to lumateperone or any components of CAPLYTA. Reactions have included pruritus, rash (e.g., allergic dermatitis, papular rash, and generalized rash), and urticaria.\n\n**Warnings & Precautions: **Antipsychotic drugs have been reported to cause:\n\n  * **Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis** , including stroke and transient ischemic attack. See Boxed Warning above.\n  * **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)** , which is a potentially fatal reaction. Signs and symptoms include: high fever, stiff muscles, confusion, changes in breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure, elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (and/or rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Patients who experience signs and symptoms of NMS should immediately contact their doctor or go to the emergency room.\n  * **Tardive Dyskinesia** , a syndrome of uncontrolled body movements in the face, tongue, or other body parts, which may increase with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose. TD may not go away, even if CAPLYTA is discontinued. It can also occur after CAPLYTA is discontinued.\n  * **Metabolic Changes** , including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with antipsychotics. Measure weight and assess fasting plasma glucose and lipids when initiating CAPLYTA and monitor periodically during long-term treatment.\n  * **Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases)**. Complete blood counts should be performed in patients with pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or history of leukopenia or neutropenia. CAPLYTA should be discontinued if clinically significant decline in WBC occurs in absence of other causative factors.\n  * **Decreased Blood Pressure & Dizziness**. Patients may feel lightheaded, dizzy or faint when they rise too quickly from a sitting or lying position (orthostatic hypotension). Heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored and patients should be warned with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.\n  * **Falls**. CAPLYTA may cause sleepiness or dizziness and can slow thinking and motor skills, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures and other injuries. Patients should be assessed for risk when using CAPLYTA.\n  * **Seizures**. CAPLYTA should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower seizure threshold.\n  * **Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment**. Patients should use caution when operating machinery or motor vehicles until they know how CAPLYTA affects them.\n  * **Body Temperature Dysregulation**. CAPLYTA should be used with caution in patients who may experience conditions that may increase core body temperature such as strenuous exercise, extreme heat, dehydration, or concomitant anticholinergics.\n  * **Dysphagia**. CAPLYTA should be used with caution in patients at risk for aspiration.\n\n\n\n**Drug Interactions:** CAPLYTA should not be used with CYP3A4 inducers. Dose reduction is recommended for concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n\n**Special Populations:** Newborn infants exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Dose reduction is recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.\n\n**Adverse Reactions** : The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials with CAPLYTA vs. placebo were somnolence/sedation, dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth.\n\nCAPLYTA is available in 10.5 mg, 21 mg, and 42 mg capsules.\n\n[Please click here to see full Prescribing Information including **Boxed Warning**.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7tP-NVuFi3VD3d03pPfJVdvEhy7njgW8mEt1hW-FQ_uV34C2u5PLQaDEmZFlE4beu0WpYWjXNcHIJL_HuWQGO3fc73rijoj1DPcSjSPHkpy60wMi-g4MLk9cpizOY2zxPeqJtrRGMLHO-edZ1Vtm48GLwiqE6KCxdZivgNdHquVqYl-9BkUaDxecfD7Spm0hcKugE3RNnmFPwQgjj1K5eGkemQ0Sv1SguoPRpycroTU=)\n\n**About CAPLYTA (lumateperone)**\n\nCAPLYTA 42 mg is an oral, once daily atypical antipsychotic approved in adults for the treatment of schizophrenia and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. While the mechanism of action of CAPLYTA is unknown, the efficacy of CAPLYTA could be mediated through a combination of antagonist activity at central serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and postsynaptic antagonist activity at central dopamine D2 receptors.\n\nLumateperone is being studied for the treatment of major depressive disorder, and other neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Lumateperone is not FDA-approved for these disorders.\n\n**About Intra-Cellular Therapies**\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies is a biopharmaceutical company founded on Nobel prize-winning research that allows us to understand how therapies affect the inner-workings of cells in the body.
