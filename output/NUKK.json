Actual outcomes may differ materially from the information contained in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including, our ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition and the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably following the business combination; costs related to the business combination; changes in applicable laws or regulations; our ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations after the completion of the business combination, and identify and realize additional opportunities; the risk of downturns and the possibility of rapid change in the highly competitive industry in which we operate; the risk that we and our current and future collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize our products or services, or experience significant delays in doing so; the risk that we may never achieve or sustain profitability; the risk that we will need to raise additional capital to execute our business plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all; the risk that we experience difficulties in managing our expected growth and expanding operations; the risk that third party vendors are not able to fully and timely meet their obligations; the risk that we are unable to secure or protect our intellectual property; the possibility that we may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties discussed under the \"Risk Factors\" section of Brilliant Acquisition Corp.'s prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2023, and the combined company's other periodic filings with the SEC. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Any forward-looking statement made in this press release is based only on information currently available and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by applicable law, the combined company expressly disclaims any obligations to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\nFor further information and to explore our digital asset solutions, please contact:\n\nJamie Khurshid COO\n\nJkhurshid@nukk.com\n\n+44 7956590095\n"

This performance capped off a volatile month, demonstrating the resilience of the U.S. stock market despite earlier turbulence. The S&P 500 also saw a strong performance, rising 1.01% to 5,648.40, marking its fourth consecutive month of gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.13%, closing at 17,713.62.\n\n### Monthly Overview\n\nDespite challenges, the major indices showed notable gains in August:\n\n  * **S &P 500**: +2.3% for the month, continuing its upward trajectory.\n  * **Dow Jones** : +1.8%, reflecting solid performance across sectors.\n  * **Nasdaq Composite** : +0.7%, supported by the technology sector.\n\n\n\nThese gains were driven by strength in key sectors, including consumer staples, real estate, and healthcare, which helped lift the overall market sentiment.\n\n### Market Challenges and Recovery\n\nThe beginning of August was tough for the markets, with significant sell-offs:\n\n  * **S &P 500**: Dropped by as much as 7.3% before recovering.\n  * **Dow Jones** : Fell 5.4%.\n  * **Nasdaq Composite** : Declined 10.7%.\n\n\n\nHowever, renewed investor optimism and stabilization in critical sectors enabled a recovery, culminating in a positive close for the month.\n\n### Inflation and Federal Reserve Outlook\n\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key measure of inflation closely monitored by the Federal Reserve, rose 0.2% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year in July. These figures aligned with economists’ expectations. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, also saw a 0.2% increase.\n\nThese inflation data will likely influence the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decisions on interest rates. The central bank is expected to carefully evaluate economic and inflation trends ahead of its September meeting. Given the stable economic outlook and resilient markets, investors are hopeful for continued positive momentum in the months ahead.\n\n### Best Buy Outlook\n\nBank of America has maintained a cautious stance on Best Buy ahead of its Q2 earnings report. Analyst Robert Ohmes highlighted short-term challenges, including a discretionary market, increased promotions in the appliance category, and margin pressures. Despite a year-to-date stock increase of around 13%, the price target of $70 implies a potential downside of over 21%. Concerns also extend to weak performance in gaming, appliances, and home theater sectors, which could limit gains in the computing sector.\n\n### Closing Market Figures for August 30, 2024\n\n  * **DOW Jones** : +0.55% at 41,563.08\n  * **S &P 500**: +1.01% at 5,648.40\n  * **NASDAQ Composite** : +1.13% at 17,713.62\n\n\n\nTags: [DOW](https://beststocks.com/tag/dow/)[dow jones futures](https://beststocks.com/tag/dow-jones-futures/)[dow jones index](https://beststocks.com/tag/dow-jones-index/)[Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://beststocks.com/tag/dow-jones-industrial-average/)[Dow jones news](https://beststocks.com/tag/dow-jones-news/)\n\n![Elaine Mendonça](https://beststocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7722483276a66fe6093765761c82f74b-150x150.png)\n\n###  [ Elaine Mendonça ](https://beststocks.com/author/elainemendonca/)\n\nOver the last nine years, Elaine has managed investment portfolio using fundamental analysis and value investing, emphasizing long-term time horizons. \n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/elainelindamaravilhosaedicaolimitada) [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-mendonça-754b66173/) [](https://www.instagram.com/elainemend/)\n\n### Discussion about this post\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nNothing on this website should be considered personalized financial advice.

Transformative Collaboration in African Payments Market\n\nby [New York Tech](/author/new-york-tech)[](https://twitter.com/benzinga)\n\nJanuary 22, 2024 9:29 AM |  4 min read  | Make a

Inc. NUKK is strategically positioning itself at the intersection of innovation and global market evolution. The year 2024 stands as a testament to the transformative trajectory of the fintech sector, driven by advancements in blockchain technology, the proliferation of cryptocurrency investment vehicles such as Bitcoin ETFs, and the emerging dominance of Web 3.0 in reshaping B2B transactions. These trends underscore a rapidly evolving landscape where traditional financial systems are being challenged, and new opportunities for market penetration and expansion are emerging.\n\nThe recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States marks a significant milestone in the acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial markets, signaling a broader trend of regulatory evolution and increasing investor interest in digital assets. This development, coupled with the speculative momentum around major cryptocurrency platforms, highlights the growing significance of blockchain and digital currencies in shaping the future of finance.\n\nSimultaneously, the fintech industry is witnessing a global shift towards Web 3.0 payments, revolutionizing B2B transactions with enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency. This shift not only promises to streamline cross-border payments but also to introduce a new era of financial inclusivity and operational agility, particularly in under-served markets such as Africa, where the potential for digital financial services is vast yet largely untapped.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Nukkleus Inc. has announced two major strategic developments aimed at cementing its position as a leader in the fintech industry.\n\n**Catalyzing Growth in Africa’s B2B Payments Sector**\n\nNukkleus is set to transform the African B2B payments market, valued at over $1.5 trillion, through a strategic collaboration aimed at revolutionizing cross-border transactions. This initiative taps into the expertise of Digital RFQ (DRFQ), a Nukkleus subsidiary, to tackle the efficiency, cost, and compliance challenges that have long plagued financial transactions within the continent.\n\nThe collaboration leverages DRFQ’s advanced payment solutions to enhance transactional efficiency and reduce costs, directly contributing to an anticipated increase in processed transaction volume. This increase is expected to have a positive impact on Nukkleus’ revenue, underscoring the significance of this strategic move within a high-potential market.\n\nBy focusing on the integration of innovative technology and local market insights, this collaborative effort is poised to significantly improve the operational landscape for B2B payments in Africa. It represents a key step towards Nukkleus’ goal of promoting financial inclusivity and efficiency across global markets.\n\nThis initiative reflects Nukkleus’ strategic foresight in identifying and seizing opportunities within emerging markets. It showcases the company’s commitment to leveraging technology for financial innovation, with the potential to set new benchmarks for transactional efficiency and reliability in the African financial sector.\n\n**Strengthening Stake in Europe’s Only Approved Bitcoin ETF**\n\nThe recent Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Jacobi Asset Management marks a significant milestone for Nukkleus, aiming to increase its holdings to approximately 20%. This move is not merely an increase in investment; it represents a strategic positioning within the European financial market, providing Nukkleus with exposure to Europe’s only approved Bitcoin spot ETF. Unlike the numerous Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) available, Jacobi’s offering is unique, being the sole ETF in the region, a distinction that carries substantial weight especially considering the recent approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC in the United States.\n\nEurope’s cautious stance, currently limiting the ETF to qualified investors and institutional players, contrasts with the U.S.’s broader acceptance. However, this could soon change, mirroring the U.S. decision to include retail investors, potentially broadening the market considerably. Nukkleus’ decision to increase its stake at this juncture could not be more timely. The anticipated regulatory evolution could make Jacobi’s ETF accessible to a wider audience, making Nukkleus’ move a strategic play to capitalize on the expanding market for digital asset investments among both institutional and possibly soon, retail investors.\n\nLooking ahead, these strategic initiatives by Nukkleus highlight the company’s vision and commitment to shaping the future of finance. Through its investment in Jacobi Asset Management and its collaborative efforts to overhaul the B2B payments infrastructure in Africa, Nukkleus is not just keeping pace with the fintech industry’s evolution but actively driving it. These moves are poised to expand Nukkleus’ global footprint, enhance its technological offerings, and significantly impact its financial performance, underscoring the company’s position as a pioneering force in the fintech sector.\n\nThe post [Tackling A $1.5 Trillion Market: Nukkleus Announces Transformative Collaboration in African Payments Market](https://nytech.media/tackling-a-1-5-trillion-market-nukkleus-announces-transformative-collaboration-in-african-payments-market/) appeared first on [New York Tech Media](https://nytech.media).\n\n[Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs](https://www.benzinga.com/apis?utm_source=benzinga.com&utm_campaign=article-bottom)\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

The firm's strategy focuses on identifying and supporting the innovations that promise to address the inefficiencies and limitations of current financial systems. By doing so, Nukkleus aims to create a synergy where the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts, leveraging the compounding interest of combined technological advancements.\n\n**The Market Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges**\n\nThe financial technology sector is undergoing rapid and significant changes, with the global cross-border payments market exemplifying this shift. As [reported](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2023/html/ecb.blog231031~85a4bcdee0.en.html) by the European Central Bank, the market is expected to grow from $190 trillion in 2023 to a staggering $290 trillion by 2030. Despite this anticipated growth, the sector remains fraught with challenges, including high transaction fees and slow processing times, which are particularly burdensome for businesses and individuals in emerging markets and developing economies.\n\nFurthermore, the increasing interest and regulatory developments surrounding cryptocurrency ETFs highlight another transformative trend within the financial market. Nukkleus' investment in Jacobi Asset Management, which launched Europe's [first](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/08/15/europes-first-spot-bitcoin-etf-lists-in-amsterdam/) spot bitcoin ETF, is a strategic move that positions the company at the forefront of this emerging asset class. This initiative aligns with the broader market's sentiment, as [noted](https://coingape.com/cathie-wood-spot-bitcoin-etf-discussions-with-us-sec/) by Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, who anticipates a positive regulatory outlook for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., signaling a potential influx of institutional investors into the crypto market.\n\n**The Role of Stablecoins in Shaping Cross-Border Payments**\n\nStablecoins have emerged as a noteworthy solution in the realm of cross-border payments, offering an alternative that promises lower fees and faster transaction times compared to traditional banking systems. They represent a significant stride toward addressing the inefficiencies plaguing the current financial landscape. However, the journey of stablecoins is not without its hurdles, including regulatory scrutiny and concerns over stability and security. Despite these challenges, their adoption continues to [grow](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/the-role-of-stablecoins-in-cross-border-payments-opportunities-and-risks/), indicating a shift toward more innovative and flexible payment solutions. Digital RFQ (DRFQ) is one of Nukkleus' wholly owned offerings which is working to solve these problems, using blockchain and stable coins as intermediaries to making international payments cheaper and more efficient.\n\nInstitutional investors seem to be betting big on the integration of blockchain into the international payments market. For example, last year, BVNK raised $40 million at a valuation of $340 million from a number of leading funds. BVNK offers banking services and payments for crypto-native businesses. Companies using BVNK can accept payments in both fiat and cryptocurrencies, hold hundreds of different currencies and crypto assets, and send funds all around the world. In other words, Nukkleus' wholly owned cross border payment operation (DRFQ) could alone be quite valuable. However, it's important to note that this is just one member of Nukkleus' unique portfolio of technologies and holdings, alongside the stake in Jacobi, their wholly owned advanced trading technology (NukkTech), and Digiclear, a proprietary digital assets custody and settlement platform poised to revolutionize post-trade processes.\n\n**Nukkleus's Strategic Positioning**\n\nNukkleus's foray into these emerging markets and technologies is not a gamble but a calculated strategy rooted in a deep understanding of the fintech sector's trajectory. By investing in and nurturing the right technologies, Nukkleus is not just preparing for the future; it is actively working to construct it. The company's approach is holistic, focusing on creating an ecosystem where different technologies and services complement and enhance each other, thereby offering a comprehensive suite of solutions that anticipate and meet the evolving needs of the market.\n\n**The Road Ahead: Navigating Growth and Regulation**\n\nAs Nukkleus continues its journey, the road ahead is lined with both immense opportunities and significant challenges. The company must navigate a landscape marked by rapid technological advancements, shifting regulatory frameworks and evolving market needs. Success will require a delicate balance between innovation and compliance, foresight and adaptability.\n\nIn conclusion, Nukkleus's commencement of trading on Nasdaq is more than just a corporate milestone; it is a declaration of the company's ambition and vision for the future. As the financial sector continues to evolve at a breakneck pace, Nukkleus's commitment to building the technological infrastructure of tomorrow positions it as a key player poised to make a lasting impact on the industry. The journey of Nukkleus is not just about creating a successful business; it's about shaping the future of finance for generations to come.\n\n_This article is not intended to serve as financial or investment advice._\n\n© Copyright IBTimes 2024.

Traditional banking and investment systems, often criticized for their inefficiencies, high costs, and lack of transparency, are giving way to innovative solutions. Blockchain technology, once known primarily as the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is now heralded as the harbinger of a financial revolution. Its promise of secure, transparent, and rapid transactions speaks directly to the core frustrations with traditional finance.\n\nThis shift is particularly palpable in developing economies where financial inclusion is a critical issue. Here, blockchain doesn’t just improve existing systems; it has the potential to revolutionize access to financial services altogether. By enabling secure, quick, and cheap transactions, blockchain can provide a lifeline to the unbanked, offering them access to the global economy and all its attendant benefits. As such, the technology is not just a tool for efficiency but a vehicle for economic empowerment.\n\nHowever, the road to this future is fraught with challenges. Regulatory landscapes are varied and complex, cybersecurity threats loom large, and the sheer novelty of the technology means that widespread adoption comes with a steep learning curve. For companies like Nukkleus, navigating this terrain requires not just technological expertise but strategic acumen and a deep understanding of the regulatory and security implications.\n\n**Nukkleus’ Strategic Positioning**\n\nIn this context, Nukkleus emerges as a particularly intriguing player. With strategic acquisitions like Jacobi Asset Management and initiatives like Digital RFQ (DRFQ), the company is building a diversified portfolio that leverages blockchain’s potential across various facets of finance.\n\nJacobi is particularly noteworthy for its pioneering work in launching Europe’s first Bitcoin spot ETF, a landmark in bridging the gap between traditional investment vehicles and the emerging digital asset class. This ETF, approved and regulated, offers a safer and more familiar route for institutional investors looking to tap into the potential of Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency dealings.\n\nDigital RFQ, another member of Nukkleus’ portfolio which is wholly owned by the company, stands out as a transformative player in the cross-border payments industry, which, as [reported](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2023/html/ecb.blog231031~85a4bcdee0.en.html) by the European Central Bank, is expected reach an astounding USD 290 trillion by 2030. Despite this anticipated growth, the sector is riddled with high transaction fees and slow processing times, especially burdensome for businesses and individuals in emerging markets. DRFQ leverages blockchain technology to address these challenges, aiming to revolutionize the way international B2B payments and currency exchanges are conducted. By promising reduced costs and increased efficiency, DRFQ positions itself as a solution to the traditionally sluggish and expensive processes, opening up new possibilities for global trade and economic activity.\n\nThe role of Jamie Khurshid, an influential figure in Nukkleus’ strategic direction, is particularly noteworthy. As a founder and CEO of Jacobi Asset Management, alongside his role as COO of Nukkleus, his insight and experience seems invaluable in guiding Nukkleus’ foray into innovative financial products like the Bitcoin ETF and DRFQ’s payment solutions. His dual role highlights the synergy between Nukkleus’ vision and the pioneering initiatives, combining deep industry expertise with a visionary outlook.\n\n**The Road Ahead**\n\nAs Nukkleus continues its journey, the path ahead is both promising and challenging. The potential of blockchain and other disruptive technologies to redefine finance is immense, but so are the hurdles. Regulatory uncertainties, technological complexities, and market volatilities are just some of the challenges that need to be navigated.\n\nMoreover, the company’s role in shaping the future of finance also comes with a responsibility to address the broader implications of these technologies. Issues like privacy, security, and the environmental impact of digital finance are increasingly at the forefront of public discourse. As Nukkleus and similar companies forge ahead, their strategies will need to be as much about innovation as they are about ethical considerations and sustainable practices.\n\nLooking ahead, the financial landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, with blockchain technology at the forefront. Nukkleus Inc., with its strategic acquisitions, visionary leadership, and commitment to innovation, is positioning itself as a key architect of this new world of finance. However, as the company and the industry move forward, the journey promises to be as challenging as it is exciting. The puzzle of the future of finance is complex, with many pieces still to be placed. Nukkleus aims to be at the forefront, not just in assembling these pieces but in ensuring that the picture they form is one of a more inclusive, efficient, and secure financial world for all.\n\n_The subject matter and the content of this article are solely the views of the author.
