IAS is also expanding TMQ for TikTok, Vertical Sensitivity, and Category Exclusions controls coverage to a total of 75+ markets by the end of 2024.\n  * **New Video Level Exclusions:** Paired with TikTok's Inventory Filter with chosen industry-aligned, vertical sensitivity, and category exclusion settings, this product excludes videos based on brand-specific needs. Currently in alpha testing for Q4 2024 with general availability expected in H1 2025.\n  * **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:** IAS TikTok products are powered by IAS's AI-driven Multimedia Technology, which enables advertisers to accurately classify content at scale through frame-by-frame analysis, combining image, audio, and text signals to better protect and grow their brands on TikTok.\n  * **From Insights to Action:** Advertisers have access to optimization and measurement across their TikTok campaigns to safeguard and scale. IAS provides advertisers with content-level measurement for granular brand safety and suitability insights at scale.\n\n\n\nIAS's AI-driven TMQ for TikTok is available across a total of 75+ countries throughout APAC, EMEA, LATAM and other regions, with support in more than 30 languages, and more to come in 2024. This depth of coverage provides advertisers with greater access to campaign data and a unified view of their global campaigns.\n\nThis latest announcement further solidifies IAS's _[deep partnership with TikTok since 2021](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4272523-1&h=113873033&u=https%3A%2F%2Fintegralads.com%2Fnews%2Fias-partners-with-tiktok%2F&a=deep+partnership+with+TikTok+since+2021)_.
