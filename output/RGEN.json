          "content": "8-K Supplement\nSeptember 18, 2024\n1\nSafe Harbor\nThis report contains forward-looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal\nsecurities laws. Any statements contained herein which do not describe historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding the\nexpected impact of the Restatement and change in accounting treatment, including on the Company’s overall business operations, previously\nreported cash and cash equivalent balances, and strategic outlook; statements regarding the Company’s internal controls overfinancial\nreporting and ongoing internal reviews and assessments; and statements regarding the Company’s 2024 guidance are based on\nmanagement’s current expectations and beliefs and are forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause\nactual results to differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among\nothers, that the Company has underestimated the scope and impact of the Restatement, risks and uncertainties around the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, the risk\nthat the Company’s restated financial statements may take longer to complete than expected, as well as those risks and uncertainties\nidentified in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including its 2023 Annual Report,\nits Current Reports on Form 8-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, including for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024,\nand in any subsequent filings with the Commission, which are available at the Commission’s website at www.sec.gov. Any such risks and\nuncertainties could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, its profitability and its cash flows, which would, in\nturn, have a significant and adverse impact on the Company’s stock price. The Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on any\nforward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company disclaims any obligation to publicly update or\nrevise any such statements to reflect any change in expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may\nbe based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. As noted\nabove, investors are cautioned that the Prior Period Financial Statements, and related investor communications, should no longer be relied\nupon; such communications include earnings releases, press releases, shareholder communications, investor presentations and other\ncommunications describing relevant portions of the Prior Period Financial Statements.\n2\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement our financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the\nfollowing non-GAAP measures of financial performance are included in these slides: adjusted income from operations. The Company’s non-\nGAAP financial results and/or non-GAAP guidance exclude the impact of: inventory step-up charges; acquisition and integration costs;\nrestructuring charges including the costs of severance; inventory adjustments and accelerated depreciation among other charges; contingent\nconsideration related to the Company’s acquisitions; intangible amortization costs; loss on extinguishment of debt; non-cash interest\nexpense related to the accretion of the debt discount; amortization of debt issuance costs related to Company’s convertible debt; foreign\ncurrency impact of certain intercompany loans; and, the related impact on tax of non-GAAP charges. These costs are excluded because\nmanagement believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, nor do the resulting charges\nrecorded accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded. All reconciliations\nof above GAAP figures (reported or guidance) to adjusted (non-GAAP) figures are detailed in the tables included later in these slides. When\nanalyzing the Company’s operating performance and guidance investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as a substitute for the\ncomparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n3\nFCihnaanngcee oOfr Agacncoizuantitoinng U Tpredaattme ent of a Specific COVID-Related Cancellation Fee\nAccounting Treatment Change Review Process and Actions\n• A $17.3M cancellation fee agreed with a key customer and • The Company believed it applied the appropriate accounting\nrecognized as revenue in Q1 2023 should have been treatment under U.S. GAAP for this transaction which was\nrecognized as $10.7M in Q4 2023, $1.8M in Q1 2024 and included in the 2023 audited financial statements.\n$4.8M in Q2 2024.\n• The complex accounting treatment was first called into\n• Overall revenue remains the same, but the timing of the question in connection with the Public Company Accounting\nrevenue will change.

In addition\nto the initial efforts contemplated in July, the Company continued further restructuring activities for the remainder of 2023. These activities in 2023 primarily\nincluded the adjustment of finished goods and raw material inventory balances down to their net realizable value from continued evaluation of the analyses\nstarted in the third quarter, such as shelf-life stability tests. Where demand has reduced, the value of this inventory, mostly secured during the COVID-19 period,\nexceeded the projected requirements to be used before reaching their expiration date. In addition, restructuring activities included costs related to the\nconsolidation of a portion of our manufacturing facilities between certain U.S. locations and severance & employee related costs.\n(2) The twelve months ended December 31, 2022 represented amortization of debt issuance costs for the period April 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 in addition to\nthe amortization of debt issuance costs for the period March 5, 2022 to March 31, 2022 after the Second Supplemental Indenture was filed. Debt issuance cost\nfor the period January 1, 2022 to March 4, 2022 were already reflected in the earnings per share (GAAP) - diluted EPS under the if-converted method of\ncalculating diluted EPS for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\n(3) During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 we recorded foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans of $7,743. The impact was recorded to\nthe Other income (expenses), net line item within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(4) Includes amortization of milestone payments in accordance with GAAP of $111 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(5) Excludes $3,816 of accelerated depreciation related to the Restructuring Plan for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This amount is included in the\ndepreciation line item of this table.\n38\nThank you!\nFor questions,contact investors@repligen.com\n39"
