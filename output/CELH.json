(Nasdaq: CELH), maker of CELSIUS ® , the premium lifestyle energy drink formulated to power active lifestyles, today reported third quarter 2024 financial results. \n\n**Summary Financials** |  **3Q 2024** |  **3Q 2023** |  **Change** |  **YTD 2024** |  **YTD 2023** |  **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**(Millions except for percentages and EPS)**  \n**Revenue** |  **$265.7** |  **$384.8** |  **(31)%** |  **$1,023.4** |  **$970.6** |  **5%**  \n**N.

Please see “Use of Non-GAAP Measures” and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, both of which can be found below.   \n---  \n  \n**John Fieldly, Chairman and CEO of Celsius Holdings, Inc., said** : “Celsius continued to drive energy drink category growth at retail in the third quarter and outpaced the category in dollar and volume sales gains despite overall category softness. Pronounced supply chain optimization by our largest distributor, which we believe has largely stabilized, had an outsized and adverse impact on our operating results during an otherwise solid quarter. We remain focused on our long-term growth strategy of expanding our consumer base, broadening our availability, and being the preferred beverage for more occasions.” \n\n**Jarrod Langhans, Chief Financial Officer of Celsius Holdings, Inc., said:** “Gross and operating margins in the third quarter fell short due to significantly reduced orders because our largest distributor implemented a sizable, successful and efficient supply chain optimization program in the quarter, but we managed our sales and marketing spend to minimize interruptions while still turning a profit in the quarter. This activity did not impact customer sales at the retail level, which remain healthy. Our strong balance sheet enabled us to acquire a long-time Celsius co-packer, Big Beverages, which we believe will unlock innovation and other supply chain efficiencies.” \n\n**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2024**\n\nFor the three months ended Sept. 30, 2024, revenue was approximately $265.7 million, compared to $384.8 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2023. Revenue from our largest distributor declined $123.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, which was primarily driven by the distributor’s inventory optimization. Concurrently, related retailer promotional allowances created revenue headwinds that would have otherwise been offset by proportional distributor sell-in during the quarter. Retail sales of Celsius in total U.S. MULO Plus with Convenience grew by 7.1% year over year in the third quarter of 2024 as reported by Circana for the last-thirteen-week period ended Sept. 29, 2024 1 . \n\nInternational sales of $18.6 million increased 37% year over year in the third quarter from $13.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nFor the three months ended Sept. 30, 2024, gross profit decreased by $71.9 million, or 37%, to $122.2 million from $194.1 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2023. Gross profit margin was 46.0% for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2024, a 440 basis point decrease from 50.4% for the same period in 2023. The decrease in gross profit was due to promotional allowances, incentives, and other billbacks as a percentage of gross revenue. These programs are driven by consumer purchases and sales from our distributors into retail, neither of which correlated with the sales that we made to our distributors this quarter due to supply chain optimization conducted by our largest distributor. Although gross profit as a percentage of revenue was lower year over year, we did receive the benefit of lower outbound freight and materials as a percentage of gross revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year. \n\nDiluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $(0.00) compared to $0.30 for the prior-year period. \n\n**YEAR-TO-DATE FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 2024**\n\nYear-to-date revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, increased 5% to $1.02 billion compared to $970.6 million for the prior-year period. International sales of $54.4 million increased 36% from $40.1 million for the prior-year period. \n\nYear-to-date gross profit increased 10% to $513.5 million compared to $466.9 million for the prior-year period. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 50.2% for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, up from 48.1% in the prior-year period. \n\n**BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**Share Growth** Celsius’ energy drink category dollar share in MULO Plus with Convenience in the last-four-week period ended Oct. 6, 2024, was 11.6%, an increase of 0.1 points compared to the year-ago period 2 . For the quarter ended Sept. 29, 2024, Celsius’ dollar share was 11.8% 3 . \n\n**Alternative Growth Drivers** Sales to Costco in the third quarter of 2024 increased 15%; however, sales to Sam’s club and BJs were negatively affected due to the timing of promotions and innovation loading in the year-ago period. Total club channel sales decreased 4% to $60.5 million in the third quarter 2024 from $63.2 million for the prior-year period. \n\nCelsius sales to Amazon increased 21% year over year to approximately $27.0 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024. Celsius’ share on Amazon for the three-month period ended Oct. 5, 2024, was 20.4% 4 . \n\nApproximately 12.3% of Celsius’ total U.S. sales to PepsiCo in the third quarter of 2024 was to the food service channel. \n\n**Innovation and Marketing** In October, Celsius introduced two new flavors in the CELSIUS ESSENTIALS line at NACS Show 2024, including Watermelon Ice and Grape Slush, and revealed plans for two new flavors in each of the CELSIUS Vibe and core product lines to come in the first half of 2025. \n\n**Organizational Excellence** Celsius acquired Big Beverages Contract Manufacturing (“Big Beverages”) in November. The strategic transaction provides Celsius with a 170,000-square-foot, modern manufacturing and warehouse facility that is expected to provide greater supply chain control, quicker innovation cycles and greater production flexibility. The facility will continue to be principally dedicated to the manufacture of Celsius products and provides the option to add capacity as the business scales and grows. \n\n**International Expansion** Sales of Celsius in Canada, the UK and Ireland continued to exceed the company’s initial expectations for the third quarter of 2024. Sales in Australia and New Zealand began in the third quarter of 2024 through major national retailers. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Webcast** Management will host a webcast at 8 a.m. EST on Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, to discuss the company’s third quarter financial results with the investment community. Investors are invited to join the webcast accessible from [https://ir.celsiusholdingsinc.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.celsiusholdingsinc.com%2F&esheet=54147615&newsitemid=20241106047853&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fir.celsiusholdingsinc.com&index=2&md5=af1b6e09dc47b5578b9692e7bb6d4e38).

Stock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of unvested restricted share unit and stock option awards granted to employees and directors. The Company believes that the exclusion provides a more accurate comparison of operating results and is useful to investors to understand the impact that stock-based compensation expense has on its operating results.   \n---|---  \n2 |  2023 distributor termination represents reversals of accrued termination payments. The unused funds designated for termination expense payments to legacy distributors were reimbursed to Pepsi for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.   \n3 |  2023 Legal class action settlement pertained to the McCallion vs Celsius Holdings class action lawsuit, which we settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2023.   \n  \n**USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES**\n\nCelsius defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before net interest income, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization expense, further adjusted by excluding stock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange gains or losses, distributor termination fees and legal settlement costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is the ratio between the company’s Adjusted EBITDA and net revenue, expressed as a percentage. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nCelsius uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for operational and financial decision-making and believes these measures are useful in evaluating its performance because they eliminate certain items that management does not consider indicators of Celsius’ operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may also be used by many of Celsius’ investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties in evaluating its operational and financial performance across reporting periods. Celsius believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provides useful information to investors by allowing an understanding of measures that it uses internally for operational decision-making, budgeting and assessing operating performance. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of Celsius’ results as reported under GAAP. Celsius strongly encourages investors to review its financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. \n\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA Margin, as defined by Celsius, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. It therefore may not be possible to compare Celsius’ use of these non-GAAP financial measures with those used by other companies. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241106047853r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nPaul Wiseman Investors: investorrelations@celsius.com  Press: press@celsius.com\n\nSource: Celsius Holdings, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://ir.celsiusholdingsinc.com/news/default.aspx)\n\nThis website uses cookies, pixels, and similar technologies (“cookies”), some of which are provided by third parties, to enable website features and functionality; measure, analyze, and improve site performance; enhance user experience; record user sessions and interactions; personalize content; and support our advertising and marketing.

(“Big Beverages”) for $75 million. The transaction was completed using cash on hand and closed on Nov. 1, 2024. \n\nThe strategic transaction provides Celsius with a 170,000-square-foot, modern manufacturing and warehouse facility that is expected to provide greater supply chain control, quicker innovation cycles and greater production flexibility. Charlotte, N.C.-based Big Beverages is a longtime Celsius co-packer, and the facility will continue to be principally dedicated to the manufacture of Celsius products. The Big Beverages management team and workforce are expected to remain with the operation. \n\n**Strategic Rationale**\n\n  * Vertical integration of a plant primarily dedicated to Celsius provides incremental research and development and LTO (limited time offer) product opportunities, as well as a turnkey facility. \n  * Future expansion opportunities with ability to add additional capacity as the business scales and grows \n  * Per-case savings and improved leverage and margins expected \n  * Solid ROIC (return on invested capital) opportunity \n  * Earnings per share accretion potential \n\n\n\n“We believe that this acquisition gives Celsius fantastic leverage to accelerate our product innovation and production capabilities so we can continue growing the energy drink category with our great tasting, functional and better-for-you performance energy drinks,” said John Fieldly, Chairman and CEO of Celsius. “The experienced team and modern facilities at Big Beverages are best-in-class, and we’re proud to continue working with these dedicated men and women to inspire even more consumers to live fit!” \n\nFieldly continued, “Vertical integration is a capital efficient growth lever that supports our vision to become the nation’s leading energy drink brand and unlocks shareholder value potential through better margin and profit structure.” \n\nFounded in 2019, Big Beverages has been a trusted partner of leading beverage brands, known for its commitment to high-quality beverage production across the mid-Atlantic. It is one of the partners Celsius employs to manufacture quality beverages. \n\n“The Big Beverages team has worked closely with Celsius for over four years, and we have always felt like we have been part of the Celsius family. We are proud of what we have accomplished, and we are very excited to join the most exciting and best tasting energy drink brand in the world,” said Ryan Goff, CEO of Big Beverages. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

You should not rely on forward-looking statements because Celsius’ actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements as a result of a number of important factors. These factors include but are not limited to: our ability to realize the benefits anticipated from acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Big Beverages, our ability to successfully manage and integrate the operations, internal controls, procedures, financial reporting and accounting systems of acquisitions, and other factors related to the operational challenges and risks of acquisitions, including (i) increased costs, indebtedness, contractual obligations and/or other liabilities; (ii) the expense of integrating acquired businesses; (iii) the ability to retain or hire the personnel required for the successful operation of the acquired business and expanded business operations, in general; (iv) the ability to retain the business relationships of the acquired businesses; (v) diversion of management’s attention; and (vi) the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs, among others; the strategic investment by and long term partnership with PepsiCo, Inc.; management’s plans and objectives for international expansion and future operations globally; general economic and business conditions; our business strategy for expanding our presence in our industry; our expectations of revenue; operating costs and profitability; our expectations regarding our strategy and investments; our expectations regarding our business, including market opportunity, consumer demand and our competitive advantage; anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operation; the impact of competition and technology change; existing and future regulations affecting our business; our ability to satisfy, in a timely manner, all Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) required filings and the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations adopted under that Section; and other risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports Celsius has filed previously with the SEC, such as its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.

          "content": "THIRD QUARTER 2024\nINVESTOR\nPRESENTATION\nNov. 6, 2024\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. | QUARTER 3, 2024 INVESTOR PRESENTATION\nSAFE HARBOR & NON-GAAP MEASURES\nThis presentation contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-\nlooking statements contain projections of Celsius’ future results of operations or financial position, or state other forward-looking information. You can identify these statements by the use of words such as\n“anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “project,” “plan,” “potential,” “designed,” “seek,” “target,” and variations of these terms, the negatives of\nsuch terms and similar expressions. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because Celsius’ actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements as a result of a\nnumber of important factors. These factors include but are not limited to: our ability to realize the benefits anticipated from acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Big Beverages, our ability to successfully\nmanage and integrate the operations, internal controls, procedures, financial reporting and accounting systems of acquisitions, and other factors related to the operational challenges and risks of acquisitions,\nincluding (i) increased costs, indebtedness, contractual obligations and/or other liabilities; (ii) the expense of integrating acquired businesses; (iii) the ability to retain or hire the personnel required for the\nsuccessful operation of the acquired business and expanded business operations, in general; (iv) the ability to retain the business relationships of the acquired businesses; (v) diversion of management’s\nattention; and (vi)the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs, among others; the strategic investment by and long term partnership with PepsiCo, Inc.; management’s plans and\nobjectives for international expansion and future operations globally; general economic and business conditions; our business strategy for expanding our presence in our industry; our expectations of revenue;\noperating costs and profitability; our expectations regarding our strategy and investments; our expectations regarding our business, including market opportunity, consumer demand and our competitive\nadvantage; anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operation; the impact of competition and technology change; existing and future regulations affecting our business; our ability to satisfy, in\na timely manner, all Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) required filings and the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations adopted under\nthat Section; and other risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports Celsius has filed previously with the SEC, such as its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current\nReports on Form 8-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made. Celsius does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking information, except to the extent\nrequired by applicable law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nCelsius defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before net interest income, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization expense, further adjusted by excluding stock-based\ncompensation expense, foreign exchange gains or losses, distributor termination fees and legal settlement costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is the ratio between the company’s Adjusted EBITDA and net\nrevenue, expressed as a percentage. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures.\nCelsius uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for operational and financial decision-making and believes these measures are useful in evaluating its performance because they eliminate\ncertain items that management does not consider indicators of Celsius’ operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may also be used by many of Celsius’ investors, securities\nanalysts, and other interested parties in evaluating its operational and financial performance across reporting periods. Celsius believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nprovides useful information to investors by allowing an understanding of measures that it uses internally for operational decision-making, budgeting and assessing operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other financial measure presented in accordance\nwith GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of Celsius’ results as reported under GAAP. Celsius\nstrongly encourages investors to review its financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by Celsius, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other\ncompanies. It therefore may not be possible to compare Celsius’ use of these non-GAAP financial measures with those used by other companies.\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. | QUARTER 3, 2024 INVESTOR PRESENTATION\n2\nDEFINITIONS\nMULO: A Circana measurement geography that reports aggregated CPG sales data from top channels across food, drug, mass,\ndollar and military.\nMULOC: A Circana measurement geography that reports aggregated CPG sales data from top channels across food, drug, mass,\ndollar, military and convenience stores.\nMULO+: A Circana measurement geography that includes MULO reported sources andadditional e-commerce and club channel\nsources.\nMULO+ With Convenience (MULO+ W/C): A Circana measurement geography that includes MULOC reported sources\nand additional e-commerce and club channel sources.\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. | QUARTER 3, 2024 INVESTOR PRESENTATION\n3\nEXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT\nJOHN FIELDLY JARROD LANGHANS TONY GUILFOYLE KYLE WATSON TOBY DAVID PAUL STOREY RICHARD MATTESSICH\nChairman, President, CEO Chief Financial Officer Chief Commercial Officer Chief Marketing Officer Chief of Staff Chief Supply Chain Officer Chief Legal Officer\n• Appointed Celsius • Joined Celsius as • Named Celsius • Named Celsius • Named Chief of • Named Chief • Joined Celsius as\nCEO in 2018 Chief Financial Chief Commercial Chief Marketing Staff in 2024 Supply Chain Chief Legal Officer\nOfficer in 2022 Officer in 2024 Officer in 2024 Officer in 2024 in 2023\n• Appointed interim • Joined Celsius as\nCEO and Chief • CFO of Eden • Joined Celsius as • Joined Celsius as Director of Business • Joined Celsius as • Deputy General\nFinancial Officer in Springs 2020-2022 EVP sales in 2020 VP marketing in Development in SVP operations in Counsel, Corporate\n2017 2019 2013 2021 & Securities of ADT,\n• 20+ years finance • Previously SVP\nInc. 2019-2023\n• Served as Celsius and operations sales at Rockstar • 20+ years marketing • 20+ years business • Previously VP\nCFO 2012-2017 experience Energy 11 years and brand development and Operations and • Nearly 30 years of\nexperience operations Director of corporate securities\n• Certified Public • Certified Public\nexperience Manufacturing at law and corporate\nAccountant Accountant\nMonster & Rockstar governance\nEnergy for 15 years experience\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. | QUARTER 3, 2024 INVESTOR PRESENTATION\n4\nDIRECTORS\nA BREADTH OF INDUSTRY, FINANCIAL & EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE\nJOHN FIELDLY HAL KRAVITZ CAROLINE LEVY JOYCE RUSSELL\nISRAEL\nCHAIRMAN LEAD DIRECTOR DIRECTOR\nKONTOROVSKY*\nINDEPENDENT\nDIRECTOR\nDIRECTOR\nNICK CASTALDO CHERYL MILLER DAMON DESANTIS HANS MELOTTE*\nDIRECTOR DIRECTOR DIRECTOR DIRECTOR\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. | QUARTER 3, 2024 INVESTOR PRESENTATION\n*New to Board since Q2 update\n5\nCELSIUS: THE WORLD’S MOST REFRESHING ENERGY DRINK\nOUR MISSION: INSPIRE PEOPLE TO LIVE FITTM WITH THE ENERGY TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS\n#3 RTD\nENERGY\n2023 FULL-YEAR FINANCIAL CATEGORY GROWTH LEADER\nHIGHLIGHTS1\nCelsius contributed 16% of all energy\n$1.32B revenue drink category growth YoY in Q3 20242\n48% gross margin #3 total share of U.S. energy drink\ncategory in tracked channels at 11.6%3\n$295.6 adjusted EBITDA\nPREMIUM BRAND\n4\n#3 6 20\nBETTER-FOR-YOU\nINGREDIENTS\nCELSIUS PRODUCT LINES:\nENERGY DRINK IN THE UNITED\nCORE | VIBE COUNTRIES ADDED IN 2024 YEARS IN OPERATION\nSTATES3\nESSENTIALS | ENERGY POWDERS ZERO SUGAR\nNOTES\n1. 2023 full-year results, reported Feb. 29, 2024\n2.

ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nBusiness Overview\nCelsius Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “Celsius Holdings” or “Celsius”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005.\nCelsius is a growing company in the functional energy drink category in the United States (“U.S.”) and internationally. The Company engages in the development,\nprocessing, marketing, sale, and distribution of functional energy drinks to a broad range of consumers. Celsius provides differentiated products that offer clinically proven\nand innovative formulas meant to positively impact the lives of its consumers. The Company's brand has also proven to be attractive to a broad range of customers,\nincluding fitness enthusiasts.\nThe Company's flagship asset, CELSIUS®, is marketed as a premium lifestyle and energy drink formulated to power active lifestyles. This product line comes in two\nversions, a 12-ounce ready-to-drink form and an on-the-go powder form. The Company also offers a CELSIUS® Essentials line, available in 16-ounce cans. Celsius\nproducts are currently offered in major retail channels across the U.S., including conventional grocery, natural, convenience, fitness, mass market, vitamin specialty and e-\ncommerce. Additionally, the Company's products are available in select markets across Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.\nAgreements with PepsiCo Inc.\nOn August 1, 2022, the Company entered into multiple agreements with PepsiCo Inc. (“Pepsi”), including a long-term agreement that resulted in Pepsi becoming the\nprimary distribution supplier for Celsius products in the U.S. (the “Distribution Agreement”). Under this agreement, the Company granted Pepsi a right of first offer in the\nevent the Company intends to manufacture, distribute or sell products in certain additional countries or channels during the term of the agreement.\nIn connection with entering into these agreements, the Company issued and sold to Pepsi approximately 1.5 million shares of the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred\nStock (“Series A” or “Series A Preferred Stock”) in exchange for cash proceeds of $550 million, before transaction costs. For additional information regarding the\nCompany's agreements with Pepsi, see Note 4. Revenue, Note 12. Related Party Transactions, and Note 13. Mezzanine Equity.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation — The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of\nRegulation S-X. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for annual audited consolidated\nfinancial statements. In management's opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year. These unaudited consolidated financial statements\nhave been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, as filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “2023 Annual Report”). These consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the\nCompany and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nSpecifically, Accounts payable and Accrued expenses were previously combined but are now presented as separate line items on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn accordance with Rule 4-08(k)(1), Rule 5-02, and Rule 5-03 of Regulation S-X, certain related party transactions previously disclosed in Note 12. Related Party\nTransactions, are now presented on the face of the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, and consolidated\nstatements of cash flow for all periods presented.\nCommon Stock Split — On November 13, 2023, the Company effected a three-for-one stock split to stockholders of record on such date (the \"Forward Stock Split\"). For\nclarity and consistency in financial reporting, all shares, restricted stock units, performance stock units, stock options, and per share amounts presented in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to account for the effects of the stock split for all periods presented.\n7\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSignificant Estimates — The preparation of consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the\nfuture, actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include promotional allowances, the allowance for current expected credit losses, allowance for\ninventory obsolescence and sales returns, the useful lives of property and equipment, impairment of goodwill and intangibles, deferred taxes and related valuation\nallowance, and the valuation of stock-based compensation.\nSegment Reporting — Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities, maintain discrete financial information, and\nundergo regular review by the chief operating decision maker (the \"CODM\"), who is the Chief Executive Officer, to assess performance and allocate resources.\nDespite the Company's presence in several geographical regions, it operates as a single operating segment. The Company's operations and strategies are centrally designed\nand executed due to the substantial similarities among the geographical components. The CODM evaluates operating results and allocates resources primarily on a\nconsolidated basis due to the significant economic interdependencies between the Company's geographical operations. As a result, the Company is managed as a single\noperating segment and has a single reportable segment.\nConcentrations of Risk — Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is derived from the sale of Celsius® functional energy drinks and liquid supplements.\nRevenue from customers accounting for more than 10% of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nFor The Three Months Ended September\n30, For The Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPepsi 47.0 % 64.6 % 53.5 % 60.8 %\nCostco 14.9 % 8.9 % 12.2 % 11.4 %\nAmazon 10.2 % 5.8 % 9.3 % 7.4 %\nAll others 27.9 % 20.7 % 25.0 % 20.4 %\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nAccounts receivable from customers accounting for more than 10% of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPepsi 55.3 % 69.0 %\nAmazon 11.3 % 5.9 %\nAll others 33.4 % 25.1 %\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not hold any instruments with original maturities exceeding three months.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily include cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $903.2 million and $755.5 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents in excess of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit.\n8\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nAccounts Receivable and Current Expected Credit Losses — The Company is exposed to potential credit risks associated with its product sales and related accounts\nreceivable, as it generally does not require collateral from its customers. The Company’s expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is determined using\nhistorical collection experience, current and expected future economic and market conditions, an assessment of the current status of customers’ trade accounts receivables,\nand where available, an evaluation of the financial condition and credit ratings of larger customers, including credit reports. Customers are pooled based on common risk\nfactors, and the Company reassesses these customer pools on a periodic basis. The allowance for credit losses is based on aging of the accounts receivable balances and\nestimated credit loss percentages. The Company estimates expected credit losses for its note receivable related to Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co. Ltd (\"Qifeng\") by\nassessing credit risk using the probability of default and incorporating forward-looking information. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from\nQifeng (the \"Note\"), must be serviced even if the licensing agreement is canceled or terminated. The Note is denominated in Chinese-Yuan. Additionally, the Company\nreserves an allowance for the entire portion of this note that is not covered by the value of certain shares of Celsius Holdings, Inc. held in a brokerage account. See Note 7.\nNote Receivable for more information.\nAllowance for Expected Credit\nLosses\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 3,137\nCurrent period change for expected credit losses 4,244\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 7,381\nInventories — Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with costs approximating those determined under the first-in, first-out method. Changes in\nthe inventory reserve are included in cost of revenue. See Note 5. Inventories for more information.\nDeferred Costs — The Company deferred the excess of the Series A Shares' fair value over the proceeds received from Pepsi as part of the Distribution Agreement. These\ndeferred costs are amortized over the twenty-year term of the agreement, aligning the recognition of the costs with the benefits derived from the agreement.\nProperty and Equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally ranging from three to seven years. See Note 8. Property and Equipment for more information.\nLeases — The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"). The Company leases office space, a warehouse and vehicles, both in the U.S. and\ninternationally under operating and finance leases that expire at various dates through 2034. For new or modified agreements, the Company assesses whether an\narrangement contains a lease by evaluating whether the Company obtains (1) the right to substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset and (2) the right to\ndirect how and for what purpose the asset is used. If the arrangement contains a lease, the Company records a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially recognized\nbased on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the applicable incremental borrowing\nrate is used in calculating the present value of the lease payments. The Company has no residual value guarantees associated with its leases. The office space leases include\nboth lease and non-lease components, such as shared operating costs that typically cover property expenses, including insurance, utilities, and maintenance. The Company\nelected the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component in the calculation of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.\nLeases with terms of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLong-Lived Assets — In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment the Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets, which includes\nproperty and equipment-net, right-of-use assets, and definite-lived intangibles-net, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for a long-lived asset if its carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The\ncarrying amount is not considered recoverable when it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use of the asset over its remaining useful life\nand final disposition. The Company did not record any impairment charges related to long-lived assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n9\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nLong-Lived Asset Geographic Data — The following table sets forth long-lived asset information, which includes property and equipment-net, right-of-use assets, and\ndefinite-lived intangibles-net and excludes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, for individual countries that represent a significant portion of the total:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nNorth America $ 37,023 $ 24,316\nFinland 11,930 12,153\nIreland 3,854 —\nSweden 2,663 2,212\nOther 30 29\nLong-lived assets related to foreign operations 18,477 14,394\nTotal long-lived assets-net $ 55,500 $ 38,710\nOther Current Liabilities — Other current liabilities primarily consist of various state beverage container deposits and VAT/GST payables. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, state beverage container deposits payables were $12.5 million and $10.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nVAT/GST payables were $2.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Other current liabilities, excluding these amounts totaled $0.5 million as of September 30, 2024, with\nno balance as of December 31, 2023.\nDeferred Revenue — The Company receives payments from certain distributors in new territories as reimbursement for contract termination costs paid to the prior\ndistributors in those territories. Amounts received pursuant to these new or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors relating to the costs\nassociated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the anticipated life of the respective new or\namended distribution agreements.\nRevenue Recognition — The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when\nperformance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred based on the commercial terms of the\ncustomer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. See Note 4. Revenue for more\ninformation.\nCost of Revenue — Cost of revenue consists of the costs of raw materials, co-packing fees, repacking fees, inbound and outbound freight charges, certain internal transfer\ncosts, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacturing of the Company’s finished products, inventory allowance for excess and obsolete products, and certain\nquality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of revenue. Raw materials include concentrates and liquid bases, cans, other containers,\nflavors, ingredients and packaging materials.\nShipping and Handling Costs — Shipping and handling costs for freight charges on goods shipped are included in cost of revenue. Freight expense on goods shipped for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $9.8 million and $16.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, the Company incurred freight expenses on goods shipped of approximately $38.2 million and $45.2 million, respectively.\nAdvertising Costs — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and charged to selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company mainly uses targeted marketing\ninitiatives, such as sporting events, print, radio, and television advertising, alongside direct sponsorships and endorsements. The Company incurred advertising costs of\napproximately $64.4 million and $46.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, the Company incurred advertising costs of approximately $170.3 million and $114.2 million, respectively.\nResearch and Development — Research and development costs are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of consulting\nfees, raw material usage and test production of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of approximately $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred research and development expenses of\napproximately $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\n10\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nForeign Currency Gain/Loss — The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ functional currencies are either the local currencies of the countries where operations are located or the\nU.S. dollar. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries remeasure their assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies on a periodic basis, and the gain or loss from\nthese adjustments related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates is included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as foreign exchange\ngain (loss). For the three months ended September 30, 2024 foreign exchange gain was $0.3 million compared to a foreign exchange loss of $0.2 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized net foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million compared to a an\nexchange loss of $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nForeign Currency Translation — The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars, which is the Company's reporting currency, using current\nexchange rates. Translation gains and losses, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature, are included in other\ncomprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation adjustments, net of income tax. The Company experienced a foreign currency translation net gain for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 of $2.0 million and a net loss of $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company incurred a foreign currency\ntranslation net gain of $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a net loss $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Company's operations in different countries required that it primarily transacted in the following currencies:\nAustralian Dollar,\nCanadian Dollar,\nChinese Yuan,\nEuro,\nHong Kong Dollar,\nNew Zealand Dollar,\nPound Sterling, and\nSwedish Krona\nFair Value of Financial Instruments — ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\"ASC 820\") defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:\nLevel 1:Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2:Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3:Unobservable inputs, which rely on the reporting entity’s assumptions when there is little or no market data.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other current liabilities, note receivable, and accrued expenses approximate fair\nvalue due to their short-term maturities and market interest rates.\nIncome Taxes — The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. This approach requires, among other\nthings, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes, and recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences\nstemming from temporary differences between asset and liability carrying amounts and their tax bases.\nA valuation allowance is established to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred asset will not be\nrealized.\nEarnings per Share — The Company computes earnings per share (\"EPS\") in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share (“ASC 260”), which requires that basic\nearnings per share of common stock are computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding. It also requires companies with different classes of stock (e.g., common stock and participating preferred stock) to calculate EPS using the two-class\nmethod. The two-class method is an allocation of earnings (distributed and undistributed) between the holders of common stock and a company’s participating preferred\nstockholders. Under the two-class method, earnings for the reporting period are allocated between common stockholders and other security holders based on their respective\nparticipation rights in undistributed earnings.\n11\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe Company also computes diluted EPS, which accounts for the impact of potentially dilutive securities on EPS. Dilutive EPS includes the effect of all potentially dilutive\nshares of common stock that were outstanding during the period. Such dilutive securities may include restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance stock units (\"PSUs\"),\nstock options, and convertible preferred stock. For the computation of diluted EPS, the numerator is adjusted for the reallocation of earnings to participating securities,\nreflecting the impact of potentially dilutive securities. The denominator is adjusted to include the weighted average number of additional shares of common stock that\nwould have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares of common stock had been issued. See Note 3. Earnings per Share for more information.\nStock-Based Compensation — The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\") and related interpretations.\nStock-based compensation cost is measured on the date of grant based on the fair value of the stock awards. The costs are recognized, over the respective vesting periods of\nthe grants. See Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation for more information.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses — Selling, general and administrative expenses include various operating expenses such as warehousing costs after\nmanufacturing, expenses for advertising, samplings and in-store demonstrations, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship\nexpenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs such as payroll costs, travel costs, professional\nservice fees (including legal fees), depreciation and other selling, general and administrative costs.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures. This standard enhances segment reporting requirements, necessitating detailed disclosures on key segment expenses and other items, including segment profit\nor loss measures. It also mandates that companies with a single reportable segment provide comprehensive disclosures. The effective date is for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application to all periods presented. The Company expects ASU 2023-\n07 to impact only disclosures with no effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, introducing changes to income tax disclosures,\nprimarily relating to effective tax rates and cash paid for taxes. This ASU requires companies to provide an annual rate reconciliation in both dollar figures and percentages,\nand changes the way annual income taxes paid are disclosed by all entities, necessitating a breakdown by federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. The standard becomes\neffective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Prospective application is permitted. The Company expects ASU 2023-09 to\nimpact only disclosures with no effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n3. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Company’s Series A Preferred Stock is classified as a participating security in accordance with ASC 260. Net income allocated to the holders of Series A Preferred\nStock is based on the Series A stockholders’ proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. The Series A Preferred\nStock is not contractually obligated to share in losses.\nFor purposes of determining diluted earnings per common share, basic earnings per common share was adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares\noutstanding. These potentially dilutive shares include unvested restricted stock and performance-based stock units. The more dilutive of the two-class method or the\ntreasury stock method is used for this adjustment. Additionally, Series A Preferred Stock is included using the if-converted method.\nUnder the two-class method, net income is reallocated to common stock, the Series A Preferred Stock, and all potentially dilutive securities based on the contractual\nparticipating rights of the respective securities to share in the current earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed.\n12\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nFor The Three Months Ended September For The Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 6,356 $ 83,949 $ 163,950 $ 176,685\nDividends on Series A convertible preferred stock (6,913) (6,875) (20,588) (20,512)\nIncome allocated to participating preferred stock — (6,702) (12,357) (13,605)\nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ (557) $ 70,372 $ 131,005 $ 142,568\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nAllocation of earnings to participating securities $ — $ 6,702 $ 12,357 $ 13,605\nReallocation of earnings to participating securities — (6,540) (12,154) (13,263)\nNet (loss) income available to common stockholders after\nassumed conversions $ (557) $ 70,534 $ 131,208 $ 142,910\nDenominator:\nWeighted average basic common shares outstanding 233,696 231,006 233,219 230,523\nDilutive effect of common shares — 6,267 4,261 6,363\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding 233,696 237,273 237,480 236,886\n(Loss) earnings per share:\nBasic $ (0.00) $ 0.30 $ 0.56 $ 0.62\nDilutive $ (0.00) $ 0.30 $ 0.55 $ 0.60\n(1) Forward Stock Split - The share numbers have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the three-for-one stock split that became effective on November 13, 2023. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 27.1 million and 21.9 million potentially dilutive securities, respectively, were excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share related to common stockholders, as their effect was antidilutive.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 22.0 million and 21.9 million potentially dilutive securities, respectively, were excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share related to common stockholders, as their effect was antidilutive.\n4. REVENUE\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. The primary performance obligation is the\npromise to sell finished products to customers, including distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. Performance obligations are typically satisfied once control or title is\ntransferred based on the commercial terms of the applicable agreements with customers, and traditionally such agreements do not allow for a right of return. Revenue is\nmeasured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Revenue is recorded net of variable consideration, such as\nprovisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages and adjusted for any expected changes due to current business\nconditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service,\nin which case the expense is classified as selling, general and administrative expenses, in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nThe amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in incentives the Company offers to its customers and their\ncustomers.\n13\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNet revenue by geographical location consisted of the following:\nFor The Three Months Ended September For The Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNorth America $ 247,125 $ 371,178 $ 968,988 $ 930,545\nEurope 16,243 11,038 47,069 31,599\nAsia-Pacific 594 1,247 2,129 4,111\nOther 1,786 1,294 5,247 4,324\nRevenue $ 265,748 $ 384,757 $ 1,023,433 $ 970,579\nAll of the Company’s North America revenue is derived from the United States and Canada.\nSweden represented the largest foreign portion of total consolidated revenue, accounting for approximately $9.5 million and $7.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately $30.7 million and $20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nPromotional (Billback) Allowances\nThe Company’s promotional allowance programs with its distributors or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business (variable\nconsideration). These agreements provide for one or more of the arrangements described below and are of varying duration. The Company’s billbacks are calculated based\non various programs with distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon\nterms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and\ndistributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between estimated and actual promotional and other allowances are recognized in the period such\ndifferences are determined.\nPromotional allowances are recorded as reductions to revenue and primarily include consideration given to the Company’s distributors or retail customers including, but not\nlimited to the following:\n• discounts from list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers;\n• reimbursements given to distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees\nfor both new and existing products;\n• the Company’s agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for certain advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;\n• the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers;\n• incentives provided to distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined volume goals or other incentive targets;\n• discounted products;\n• contractual fees paid to distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the distributors’ sales territories; and\n• contractual fees given to distributors for items sold below defined pricing targets.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, promotional allowance included as a reduction of revenue was $110.3 million and $88.6 million, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, promotional allowance included as a reduction of revenue was $326.7 million and $240.6 million, respectively.\n14\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nAgreements with Pepsi\nThe Company executed multiple agreements with Pepsi on August 1, 2022, including the Distribution Agreement relating to the sale and distribution of certain of the\nCompany’s beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods in the U.S., excluding certain existing customer accounts and sales channels, and the U.S.\nVirgin Islands (collectively, the “Territory”). Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company granted Pepsi the right to sell and distribute its existing beverage products in\nexisting channels and distribution methods and future beverage products that are added from time to time as licensed products under the Distribution Agreement in the\nTerritory. The Distribution Agreement represents a master service agreement and can be canceled by either party without cause in the nineteenth year of the term (i.e.,\n2041), the twenty-ninth year of the term (i.e., 2051) and in each 10th year thereafter (i.e., 2061, 2071, etc.) by providing 12 months’ written notice to the other party on\nAugust 1st of the year preceding the year of termination. Except for a termination by the Company “with cause” or a termination by Pepsi “without cause,” (each as defined\nin the Distribution Agreement), the Company is required to pay Pepsi certain compensation upon a termination as specified in the Distribution Agreement.\nThe Company agreed to provide Pepsi a right of first offer in the event the Company intends to (i) manufacture, distribute or sell products in certain additional countries as\nspecified in the Distribution Agreement or (ii) distribute or sell products in any future channels and distribution methods during the term of the Distribution Agreement.\nPepsi agreed to meet and confer in good faith with the Company regarding the terms and conditions upon which Pepsi may be willing to sell or distribute the Company's\nproducts, either directly or through local sub-distributors in certain other additional countries. The Distribution Agreement includes other customary provisions, including\nnon-competition covenants in favor of the Company, representations and warranties, indemnification provisions, insurance provisions, and confidentiality provisions. In the\nfourth quarter of 2023, under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company and Pepsi agreed to extend distribution to the Canadian market, which commenced in\nJanuary of 2024 with Pepsi serving as the exclusive distributor.\nOn August 1, 2022, the Company and Pepsi executed a transition agreement providing for the Company’s transition of certain existing distribution rights in the Territory to\nPepsi (the “Transition Agreement”). Under the terms of the Transition Agreement, Pepsi agreed to pay the Company up to $250 million in multiple tranches to facilitate the\nCompany’s transition of certain distribution rights to Pepsi. The Company received $227.8 million from Pepsi that were contractually restricted to be used only to pay\ntermination fees due to other distributors; any excess cash received over amounts due to other distributors was required to be refunded to Pepsi. During 2023, $38.3 million\nof such funds were refunded to Pepsi. As of and after December 31, 2023, there was no refund liability owed to Pepsi.\nOn March 23, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Distribution Agreement with Pepsi, pursuant to which the Company will provide Pepsi with an\nincentive program designed to incentivize and compensate Pepsi for its continued focus on and actions to support the Company. These incentives are accounted for as\npromotional allowances and recorded as a reduction to revenue.\nLicense Agreement\nIn January 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license\nrights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius branded products in China. The term of the agreement is 50 years, with annual royalty fees due from Qifeng after\nthe end of each calendar year. The royalty fees are based on a percentage of Qifeng’s sales of Celsius branded products; however, the fees are fixed for the first five years of\nthe agreement, totaling approximately $6.9 million combined, and then are subject to annual guaranteed minimums over the remaining term of the agreement.\nUnder the agreement, the Company granted Qifeng exclusive license rights and provides ongoing support in product development, brand promotion and technical expertise.\nThe ongoing support is integral to the exclusive licensing rights; therefore, the license and the support represent a combined, single performance obligation. The transaction\nprice consists of the guaranteed minimums and the variable royalty fees, all of which are allocated to the single performance obligation.\nThe Company uses the passage of time to measure progress towards satisfying its performance obligation because of its ongoing efforts in providing the exclusive license\nrights, including providing continuous access, updates and support, to product development, brand promotion and technical expertise.\n15\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n5.

See Note 4. Revenue for information regarding the license agreement with Qifeng.\nIn addition to the license agreement, Qifeng agreed to repay, over a five-year period, the marketing investments made by Celsius into the China market through 2018. The\nNote required annual principal and interest payments on March 31 of each year, with the final payment scheduled for 2024. In February 2024, the Company amended the\nNote and extended the final maturity date to December 31, 2024. The Note is recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for expected credit losses. Interest income\ngenerated from the Note is included in the financial statement line item Interest income on note receivable in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive\nincome.\nThe Company assesses the Note by considering the probability that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled principal and interest payments based on historical\nexperience of Qifeng’s ability to pay, the current economic environment, forward-looking information and other factors. As evidence of solvency for the Note, a stock\ncertificate in Celsius Holdings, Inc. representing 60,000 shares owned by an affiliate under common control of Qifeng is held at a brokerage account. A letter of guarantee\nwas executed with several restrictions regarding their shares. In particular, it was agreed that the stock would not be sold or transferred without the prior written consent\nfrom Celsius.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nTransactions with Pepsi\nAs further described in Note 13. Mezzanine Equity, on August 1, 2022, the Company issued approximately 1.5 million shares of non-voting Series A Preferred Stock to\nPepsi. The shares accounted for approximately 8.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock on the date of issuance, on an if-converted method. The purchase\nagreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), pursuant to which Pepsi acquired the Series A Preferred Stock, grants Pepsi the right to designate a nominee for election to the\nCompany’s Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), provided that Pepsi meets certain ownership requirements.\nPepsi provided the Company $227.8 million in cash under the Transition Agreement in 2022. This amount was used to settle termination fees with former distributors, and\nany excess cash was contractually restricted and due back to Pepsi. During 2023, $38.3 million of such funds were refunded to Pepsi. Amounts received pursuant to the\nTransition Agreement relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors were accounted for as deferred revenue and are being recognized\nratably over the 20 year term of the Distribution Agreement. Unamortized deferred revenues (current and non-current) are included as separate line items on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nOn August 1, 2022, the Company issued Series A Preferred Stock with a fair value of $832.5 million for an issuance price of $550.0 million and recorded the $282.5 million\nexcess as deferred costs on the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 13. Mezzanine Equity). Costs are being amortized over the 20 year term of the Distribution Agreement\nand are recorded as an offset to revenue. Unamortized deferred other costs (current and non-current) are included as separate line items on the consolidated balance sheets.\nSee Note 1. Organization and Description of Business, Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 4. Revenue, and Note 13.\nMezzanine Equity for more information.\nRelated Party Leases\nThe Company’s office space is leased from a company affiliated with CDR Federal, LLC, which is owned by certain of the Company's principal stockholders. The leases\nextend until March 2025 and have a combined monthly rent of $55 thousand. The associated lease liability was $0.5 million as of both September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\n13. MEZZANINE EQUITY\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has designated and authorized 1,466,666 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.001 per\nshare and a stated value of $375.00 per share. The stated value per share may be increased from time to time in the event dividends on the Series A are paid-in-kind (“PIK\ndividends”) pursuant to the Series A Certification of Designation (the “Series A Certificate”). On August 1, 2022, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued\nall of the authorized Series A Preferred Stock to Pepsi for stated cash consideration aggregating $550 million, excluding\n20\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nissuance costs. The Series A Preferred Stock was issued concurrently with the execution of the Distribution Agreement and the Transition Agreement. The Company\ndetermined that the aggregate fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock on the issuance date was $832.5 million, or $567.61 per share. Accordingly, the Series A Preferred\nStock was recorded at that amount, net of issuance costs of $8.0 million, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, and consolidated statements of changes in\nstockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity.\nThe Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of the approximately 1.5 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued on\nAugust 1, 2022. The valuation of the Series A Preferred Stock represents a non-recurring fair value measurement. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to\ndetermine the fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock on August 1, 2022. The Monte Carlo simulation utilized multiple level 2 input variables to determine the value of\nthe Series A Preferred Stock including a volatility rate of 45%, risk free interest rate of 2.69%, 5.0% dividend rate, the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the\nissuance date of $98.87 (pre-split), a debt discount rate of 12.5% and a discount for lack of marketability attributed to the registration period of the underlying stock. The\nselected historical volatility was based on Celsius and a certain peer group. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. STRIPS Rate with a corresponding term as of\nissuance date. The 5.0% dividend rate is consistent with the provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock and with the Company’s past payments of dividends made in cash.\nThe debt discount rate was based on estimated credit analysis and corresponding market yields as of the issuance date. The Company applied a nominal discount for lack of\nmarketability with respect to the assumed registration period of the underlying shares.\nMezzanine Classification\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable in the event of a change in control as defined in the Series A Certificate. ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (\"ASC\n480\"), specifically ASC 480-10-S99-3A, requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if they are\nredeemable (i) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (ii) at the option of the holder, or (iii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely\nwithin the control of the issuer. Preferred securities that are mandatorily redeemable are required to be classified by the issuer as liabilities whereas under ASC 480 an issuer\nshould classify a preferred security whose redemption is contingent on an event not entirely in control of the issuer as mezzanine equity. The Series A is not considered\nmandatorily redeemable other than in the event of a change of control, and a change in control is not solely in control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company\ndetermined that mezzanine treatment is appropriate for the Series A and has presented it as such in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes\nin stockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity, as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Pepsi, together with its affiliates, has certain rights and is also subject to various restrictions with respect to its ownership of the\nCompany’s outstanding common shares on an as-converted basis, through purchases of the Company’s common stock in the open market and the accumulation of PIK\ndividends. Additionally, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Pepsi has the right to designate one nominee for election to the Board so long as Pepsi (together with its\naffiliates) beneficially owns at least approximately 11.0 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. Notwithstanding that the\nSeries A is not currently convertible into common stock, the Purchase Agreement provides that Pepsi is deemed to beneficially own the underlying shares of common stock\nfor purposes of its rights under the Purchase Agreement. In August 2022, the Company expanded the number of Board seats in connection with the election of a Pepsi\nrepresentative to the Board.\nLiquidation Preference\nThe Series A ranks, with respect to distribution rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution, (i) senior and in priority of payment to the Company’s common\nstock, (ii) senior to any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking junior to the Series A, (iii) on parity with any class or series of\ncapital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series A, and (iv) junior to any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly\ndesignated as ranking senior to the Series A. The aggregate liquidation preference of the Series A was $550 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nVoting\nThe Series A confers no voting rights, except as otherwise required by applicable law, and with respect to matters that adversely change the powers, preferences, privileges,\nrights or restrictions given to the Series A or provided for its benefit, or would result in securities that would be senior to or pari passu with the Series A. As described\nabove, Pepsi has a contractual right to representation on the Board, subject to maintaining certain ownership thresholds.\n21\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nStock Split\nAs a result of the Forward Stock Split, the conversion ratio for Series A Preferred Stock, initially set at five-for-one, was adjusted to fifteen-for-one. The adjustment\nmaintains the proportional interests of Series A stockholders post-split. The revised conversion ratio, reflecting the impact of the Forward Stock Split, became effective on\nthe split's effective date.\nDividends\nThe Series A entitles the holder to cumulative dividends, which are payable quarterly in arrears either in cash, in-kind, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election\n(“Regular Dividends”). Regular Dividends accrue on each share of Series A at the rate of 5.00% per annum, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Series A Certificate. In\naddition to such quarterly Regular Dividends, shares of Series A also entitle the holder to participate in any dividends paid on the Company’s common stock on an as-\nconverted basis. There were no cumulative undeclared dividends on the Series A at September 30, 2024. There were no dividends issued to common stockholders for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nRedemption\nSubject to certain conditions set forth in the Series A Certificate, Series A may be redeemed at a price per share of Series A equal to the sum of (i) the stated value of such\nshare of Series A as of the applicable redemption date, plus (ii) without duplication, all accrued and unpaid dividends previously added to the stated value of such share of\nSeries A, and all accrued and unpaid dividends per share of Series A through such redemption date (the “Redemption Price”).\nCompany’s Optional Redemption\nAt any time from and after the earlier of (i) August 1, 2029, if the ten-day volume weighted average price of the Company’s common stock (the “Ten-Day VWAP”) does\nnot exceed the conversion price on the date immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a redemption notice to the holders, and (ii) the cancellation of the\nDistribution Agreement by the Company, the Company has the right to redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-outstanding shares of Series A at the Redemption Price.\nIn the event of the Company's optional redemption, the Company shall affect such redemption by paying the entire Redemption Price on or before the date that is thirty days\nafter the delivery of the Company’s redemption notice and by redeeming all the shares of Series A on such date.\nChange in Control Redemption\nIn the event of a change in control, as defined by the following scenarios, the Company (or its successor) shall redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-issued and\noutstanding shares of Series A: (i) a sale or transfer, directly or indirectly, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in any transaction or series of related\ntransactions (other than sales in the ordinary course of business); (ii) any merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with or into any other entity or entities as\na result of which the holders of the Company’s outstanding capital stock (on a fully-diluted basis) immediately prior to the merger, consolidation or reorganization no longer\nrepresent at least a majority of the voting power of the surviving or resulting Company or other entity; or (iii) any sale or series of sales, directly or indirectly, beneficially or\nof record, of shares of the Company’s capital stock by the holders thereof which results in any person or group of affiliated persons owning capital stock holding more than\n50% of the Company's voting power.\nUpon a change in control and redemption, each Series A holder will receive, an amount equal to the greater of (A) the Redemption Price in cash, or (B) the cash and/or\nother assets (including securities) such holder would have received if each share of Series A were converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to the then-\napplicable conversion ratio and participated in such transaction resulting in such change of control as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the\neffective date of such transaction.\nIf the Company or its successor shall not have sufficient funds legally available under the Nevada law governing distributions to stockholders to redeem all outstanding\nshares of Series A, then the Company shall (A) redeem, pro rata among the holders, a number of shares of Series A equal to the number of shares of Series A that can be\nredeemed with the maximum amount legally available for the redemption, and (B) redeem all remaining shares of Series A not redeemed because of the foregoing\nlimitations at the applicable change of control Redemption Price as soon as practicable after the Company (or its successor) is able to make such redemption out of assets\nlegally available for the purchase of such shares of Series A. The inability of the Company (or its successor) to make a redemption payment for any reason shall not relieve\nthe Company (or its successor) from its obligation to affect any required redemption when, as and if permitted by applicable law.\n22\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nHolder Right to Request Redemption\nOn each of August 1, 2029, August 1, 2032, and August 1, 2035, the majority holders of the Series A have the right, upon no less than six months prior written notice to the\nCompany, to request that the Company redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-outstanding shares of Series A, at the Redemption Price.\nIn the event of a holder-optional redemption, the Redemption Price will be payable, and the Company shall redeem the shares in three equal installments. These installments\nwould commence on August 1, 2029, August 1, 2032, or August 1, 2035, as applicable, and in each case on the fifteenth- and thirtieth-month anniversary thereafter. On each\nredemption date for a holder-optional redemption, the Company will redeem shares of Series A on a pro rata basis according to the number of shares owned by each holder.\nThe number of outstanding shares will be determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such\nredemption date by (ii) the number of remaining redemption dates (including the redemption date to which such calculation applies).\nIf, on any redemption date, legal constraints under the Nevada law governing distributions to stockholders or the terms of any indebtedness of the Company to financial\ninstitutions prevents the Company from redeeming all shares of Series A, the Company will ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may legally redeem, and\nwill redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so.\nShould any shares of Series A scheduled for redemption on a redemption date remain unredeemed for any reason on such redemption date, the following will occur: from\nthe redemption date to the fifteen-month anniversary of such redemption date, the dividend rate with respect to such unredeemed share will automatically increase to 8%\nper annum. From such fifteenth-month anniversary to the thirtieth-month anniversary of such redemption date, the dividend rate with respect to such unredeemed share will\nautomatically increase to 10% per annum. After such thirtieth-month anniversary of such redemption date, the dividend rate with respect to any such unredeemed share will\nautomatically increase to 12% per annum, in each case until such share is duly redeemed or converted.\nConversion\nThe shares of Series A may be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Series A Certificate either at the option of the Company or subject to\nan automatic conversion as discussed below. The Series A was issued with a conversion price of $25 which is potentially subject to adjustment pursuant to the Series A\nCertificate. The conversion ratio is calculated as the quotient of (a) the sum of (x) the stated value of such share of Series A as of the applicable conversion date, plus (y) all\naccrued and unpaid dividends previously added to the stated value of such share of Series A, and without duplication, all accrued and unpaid dividends per share of Series A\nthrough the applicable conversion date; divided by (b) the conversion price as of the conversion date. As of September 30, 2024, the conversion ratio of the Series A into\ncommon was one-for-fifteen. At September 30, 2024, approximately 22.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock were issuable upon conversion of the Series A\nPreferred Stock.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Series A was not probable of becoming redeemable, as the most likely method of settlement is through conversion which is likely to occur\nbefore the holder's right to request redemption becomes exercisable.\nCompany Optional Conversion\nAt any time from and after August 1, 2029, provided the Ten-Day VWAP immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a conversion notice to the holders of Series A\nexceeds the conversion price, the Company may elect to convert all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares of Series A into shares of the Company’s common stock.\n23\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nAutomatic Conversion\nThe Series A will convert automatically into shares of the Company’s common stock upon the occurrence of any of the following, each an “Automatic Conversion Event”:\n• Any date from and after the valid termination of the Distribution Agreement by the Company or Pepsi, if the Ten-Day VWAP immediately preceding such date\nexceeds the conversion price of such share as of such date.\n• Any date from and after August 1, 2028, on which (x) the Company’s products meet a market share requirement during a specified period (as defined in the\nDistribution Agreement) and (y) the Ten-Day VWAP immediately prior to such date exceeds the conversion price of such share as of such date. In the case of an\nAutomatic Conversion Event, each share of Series A then outstanding shall be converted into the number of shares of common stock equal to the conversion ratio\nof such share in effect as of the automatic conversion date. The occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event will terminate any right of the holder to receive a\nredemption at their request even if such request had already been submitted, provided that the Series A Preferred shares had not already been redeemed.\n14. INCOME TAXES\nIn general, the Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which\nthe Company operates, to determine its quarterly provision for income taxes. Certain discrete items are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur and can be a\nsource of variability on the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter. The Company’s effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-\nrecurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, and state and local income taxes.\nThe effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.3%. Such rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% primarily\ndue to disallowed stock-based compensation expense and state income taxes. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.1%. Such\nrate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to significant windfall benefits on stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter\ntreated as a discrete items, offset by disallowed stock-based compensation expense and state income taxes.\nThe effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 19.9%. Such rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% primarily\ndue to net benefits on stock-based compensation awards, disallowed stock-based compensation expense and state income taxes. The effective income tax rate for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 was 21.1%. Such rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to disallowed stock-based compensation\nexpense and state income taxes, partially offset by windfall benefits on stock-based compensation awards.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax returns for tax years beginning 2020\nremain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities.\n15. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOn April 30, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2015 Plan\") with the objective of attracting and retaining highly competent personnel through\nopportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2024, 20.8 million shares were available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan expires in 2025, and the Company intends to seek\nstockholder approval of a new plan at the Company's 2025 annual meeting of stockholders.\nThe 2006 Incentive Stock Plan (the \"2006 Plan\"), which was adopted on January 18, 2007 and expired in 2017, similarly had the objective of attracting and retaining highly\ncompetent employees, directors, and independent consultants through opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock. As of September 30, 2024, there were no\nunvested awards under the 2006 Plan and certain vested but unexercised awards remained outstanding. No further awards can be granted under the 2006 Plan.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $5.4 million and $5.0 million,\nrespectively, included in selling, general and administrative expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, this expense was approximately\n$13.7 million and $16.2 million, respectively, included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company used straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service or vesting period of the grant and recognizes forfeitures as they occur.\n24\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nStock Options\nThe maximum contractual term of the Company’s stock options is 10 years.\nThe Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards and warrant issuances.\nA summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock options as of September 30, 2024 and changes during the nine months ending on that date is as follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average Aggregate Average\nExercise Intrinsic Remaining\nShares Price Value(1) Term (Yrs)\nAt December 31, 2023 4,918 $ 3.81 $ 249,541 4.45\nExercised (2,489) 1.54 112,394 —\nForfeiture and cancelled — — — —\nAt September 30, 2024 2,429 $ 6.13 $ 61,277 5.00\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 2,429 $ 6.13 $ 61,277 5.00\n(1 The intrinsic value represents the amount by which the fair value of the Company's common stock exceeded the option exercise price as of September 30, 2024.\nThe total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised was $51.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $50.5 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised was $112.4 million compared to\n$78.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The total number of stock options exercised was 1.7 million during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense related to options to purchase shares.\n25\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units are awards that give the holder the right to receive one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit upon meeting service-based vesting\nconditions (typically annual vesting in three equal annual installments, with a requirement that the holder remains in the continuous employment of the Company). The\nCompany determines the fair value of restricted stock-based awards that vest over time based on the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. The holders of\nunvested units do not have the same rights as stockholders and do not have the right to receive any dividends or the right to vote.\nA summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented in the following table:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nGrant Date Grant Date\nShares Fair Value Shares(1) Fair Value(1)\nUnvested at beginning of period 1,218 $ 26.13 1,617 $ 20.24\nGranted 279 73.67 432 35.14\nVested (653) 22.90 (618) 19.50\nForfeited and cancelled (66) 38.07 (192) 24.22\nUnvested at end of period 778 $ 44.95 1,239 $ 31.42\n(1) Forward Stock Split - The share numbers have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the three-for-one stock split that became effective on November 13, 2023. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information.\nThe total fair value of shares vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $15.0 million and $22.1 million, respectively.\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock units to employees and directors as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $25.0 million and\n$20.0 million, respectively, and is expected to be expensed over the next 2.1 years.\nPerformance-based Stock Awards\nPSUs are awards that give the holder the right to receive one share of common stock for each PSU upon meeting performance or market-based vesting conditions. These\nconditions typically include the attainment of specific metrics over a defined period. The fair value of the PSUs is determined based on either the grant date fair value for\nperformance metrics or using a Monte Carlo simulation for market based awards. The Company recognizes expense if the metrics are probable of being achieved and\nexpensed using either a straight line or an accelerated attribution model. Additionally, the Company recognizes compensation expense for non-employees in the same\nmanner and periods as though cash had been paid for services received.\nThe Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved certain PSUs under the 2015 Plan, with each PSU initially equivalent in value to\none share of Celsius' common stock.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, PSUs with an aggregate grant date fair value of $7.5 million, were issued to certain employees. These awards included an immediate vesting of\n20% of the shares as well as specific performance-based metrics to be met in year one and year two of the issuance. These awards were fully vested, using the accelerated\nattribution method according to ASC 718, during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nIn March 2024, PSUs with an aggregate award of approximately 65,000 shares of the Company's common stock were granted to certain officers of the Company. The PSUs\nvest over a period of three years from the grant date based on continuous service, with the number of shares earned (50% to 200% of the target awarded) depending upon\nthe extent to which the Company can achieve certain financial and market performance targets measured over the period beginning January 1, 2024 through December 31,\n2026. Approximately one-third of the PSUs were valued at $79.27 per PSU based on the Company's common stock price on the grant date, and the financial targets for\nvesting are based on the Company's achievement of certain revenue metrics. The Company recognizes the grant-date fair value of these PSUs as stock-based compensation\nexpense ratably over the vesting period based on the number of awards expected to vest at each reporting date. The remaining PSUs were valued using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model. This model incorporates assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate based on zero-coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury\n26\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nissuances, and expected volatility derived from historical data of the Company's common stock and certain indices. The Company recognizes the grant-date fair value of\nthese awards as stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. Approximately one-third of the performance target for vesting is based on total\nshareholder return relative to the Company's peer group, with each PSU valued at $134.75. The remaining one-third have a vesting performance target based on a specific\nmarket price, with each PSU valued at $20.25.\nIn August 2024, an aggregate of 104,000 PSUs were issued to certain employees of the Company with a performance period ending on December 31, 2025. The PSUs were\nvalued at $39.40 per unit, based on the Company's common stock price on the grant date. A total of 87,000 shares vest dependent on the Company meeting specific market\nshare MULO+C metrics for each of the years ending December 31, 2024, and 2025. Should the performance goal not be met by the period ending December 31, 2024, the\nportion of shares shall remain outstanding and vest if the December 31, 2025, goal is met. The remaining 17,000 shares vest if the Company meets a cumulative\ninternational revenue target, in 2024 and 2025 to be achieved by December 31, 2025.\nA summary of the Company’s PSU activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented in the following table:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nGrant Date Grant Date\nShares Fair Value Shares (1) Fair Value (1)\nUnvested at beginning of period 123 $ 29.43 228 $ 30.49\nGranted 169 53.80 — —\nVested (78) 32.76 (93) 32.76\nForfeited and cancelled — — (12) 24.87\nUnvested at end of period 214 $ 47.94 123 $ 30.45\n(1) Forward Stock Split - The share numbers have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the three-for-one stock split that became effective on November 13, 2023.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal\nSEC Inquiry\nOn January 8, 2021, the Company received a letter from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking the production of documents in connection with a non-public, fact-\nfinding inquiry by the SEC to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws had occurred. Subsequent to January 8, 2021, the Company received subpoenas for\nproduction of documents in connection with this matter. The investigation and requests from the SEC do not represent that the SEC has concluded that the Company or\nanyone else has violated the federal securities laws. The Company has cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the SEC staff in its investigation and requests. At this\ntime, however, the Company cannot predict the length, scope, or results of the investigation or the impact, if any, of the investigation on the Company's results of\noperations.\nDerivative Actions\nOn January 11, 2023, certain of the Company’s directors and present and former officers were named as defendants in a derivative action complaint filed in the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Nevada, (the \"Lampert Derivative Action\"). The Company was named as a nominal defendant. The allegations involve purported false and\nmisleading statements or omissions made between August 12, 2021, and March 1, 2022, which are claimed to have artificially inflated the Company’s stock price. This\naction asserts the following claims: (i) breach of fiduciary duty, (ii) unjust enrichment, and (iii) violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated\nthereunder.\nSubsequently, substantially similar derivative action complaints were filed, first on May 19, 2023, against the Company, as a nominal defendant, and certain of the\nCompany's directors and present and former officers in a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, (the \"Hammond Derivative\nAction\"). This class action asserts claims for (i) breach of fiduciary duty, (ii) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, (iii) unjust enrichment, (iv) waste of corporate\nassets, and (v) violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.\nA second action was filed on July 10, 2023, against the Company, as a nominal defendant, and certain of the Company’s directors and present and former officers in a\nderivative action in the District Court for the Eighth Judicial District in Clark County, Nevada, (the “Ingrao Derivative Action”). The Ingrao Derivative Action asserts\nclaims for (i) breach of fiduciary duty and (ii) unjust enrichment.\nA third action was filed on July 12, 2023 against the Company, as a nominal defendant, and certain of the Company’s directors and present and former officers in a\nderivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the “Hepworth Derivative Acton”). This class action asserts claims for (i) breach of fiduciary\nduty, (ii) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, (iii) unjust enrichment, (iv) waste of corporate assets, and (v) violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and\nRule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.\nThe Lampert Derivative Action remains stayed, pursuant to the Court’s Order, issued on July 9, 2024, which approved the parties’ joint stipulation to stay of litigation. The\nIngrao Derivative Action remains stayed, following the Court’s entry of an Order, on September 11, 2023, approving the parties’ joint stipulation regarding stay of litigation.\nOn March 11, 2024, the Hammond Derivative Action and the Hepworth Derivative Actions were voluntarily dismissed and, on April 11, 2024, a single complaint\ncontaining substantially similar allegations was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, (the \"Refiled Derivative Action\"). The Refiled Derivative Action\nremains stayed, following the Court’s Order, issued on June 12, 2024, approving the parties’ joint stipulation to stay the litigation. Plaintiffs have collectively proposed that\ncertain corporate governance actions be implemented and have requested attorney fees. Although the Company believes the various derivative actions are without merit, the\nCompany has reached a negotiated settlement in principle, the amount of which is immaterial.\nStrong Arm Productions\nOn May 4, 2021, Plaintiffs Strong Arm Productions USA, Inc., Tramar Dillard p/k/a Flo Rida, and D3M Licensing Group, LLC filed a lawsuit against the Company in the\nCircuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida. Plaintiffs asserted that the Company breached two endorsement and licensing agreements that\nwere entered into, between Plaintiffs and the Company in 2014 and 2016. Plaintiffs alleged the Company had reached certain revenue and sales benchmarks set forth in the\n2014 agreement that entitled them to receive 2.3 million shares (as adjusted for the Forward Stock Split) of the Company's common stock. In addition, Plaintiffs claimed\nthey were entitled to receive unspecified royalties under the 2016 agreement.\n28\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nA jury trial commenced on this matter on January 10, 2023. On January 18, 2023, the jury rendered a verdict against the Company for $82.6 million in compensatory\ndamages. On April 27, 2023, the court denied the Company’s post-trial motions which sought (i) dismissal of the case notwithstanding the verdict based on the plain\nlanguage of the contracts at issue; (ii) in the alternative, granting a new trial; or (iii) in the alternative, reducing the award of damages to $2.1 million, which reflects the\nCompany’s stock price on the date that the jury found the relevant revenue and sales benchmarks at issue were met. The judgment will accrue post-judgement interest at\n5.52% per year as of February 13, 2023.\nThe Company believes that the jury verdict is not supported by the facts of the case or applicable law, is the result of significant trial error, and there are strong grounds for\nappeal. The Company filed a notice of appeal to the Fourth District Court of Appeal for the State of Florida on February 21, 2023, which is currently proceeding. The\nCompany intends to vigorously challenge the judgment through the appeal processes, and filed its initial brief on October 6, 2023.\nThe Company believes that the likelihood that the full amount of the judgment will be affirmed is not probable. The Company currently estimates a range of possible\noutcomes between $2.1 million and $82.6 million plus interest and has accrued a liability as of September 30, 2024, reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses in\nthe consolidated balance sheets, at the low end of that range. The ultimate amount of the original judgement that the Company may be required to pay could be materially\ndifferent than the amount the Company has accrued. The Company cannot predict or estimate the duration or ultimate outcome of this matter.\nCommitments\nThe Company has entered into distribution agreements that provide for the payment of liquidated damages in the event that the Company terminates the distribution\nagreements without cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. If management makes the decision to terminate an agreement without cause, an estimate of expected\ndamages is accrued, and an expense is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses for the period in which termination was initiated.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had purchase commitments to third parties of $62.8 million and $55.3 million, respectively. The\nCompany's purchase obligations are primarily related to third party suppliers and have arisen through the normal course of business. These obligations vary in terms and\nnone are individually significant.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had long term contractual obligations aggregating to approximately $42.3 million and $34.4 million,\nrespectively, which related primarily to suppliers, sponsorships, and other marketing activities.\n17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn November 1, 2024, Celsius completed its acquisition of all issued and outstanding membership interests in Big Beverages Contract Manufacturing, L.L.C. (\"Big\nBeverages\"), pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement, for $75.0 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments.

We engage in the development, processing, marketing, sale,\nand distribution of functional energy drinks to a broad range of consumers. We provide differentiated products that offer clinically proven and innovative formulas meant to\npositively impact the lives of our consumers. Our brand has also proven to be attractive to a broad range of customers, including fitness enthusiasts.\nOur flagship asset, CELSIUS®, is marketed as a premium lifestyle and energy drink formulated to power active lifestyles. This product line comes in two versions, a 12-ounce\nready-to-drink form and an on-the-go powder form. During 2023, we introduced a new CELSIUS® Essentials line, available in 16-ounce cans. Our products are currently\noffered in major retail channels across the U.S., including conventional grocery, natural, convenience, fitness, mass market, vitamin specialty and e-commerce. Additionally, our\nproducts are currently offered in certain Canadian, European, Middle Eastern, and Asia-Pacific markets.\nAn integral part of our value proposition is our focus on the functional energy drink and liquid supplement category, ensuring our products have clear and proven benefits. This\nis why we invest in research and development from the start and utilize our proprietary MetaPlus formulation in our portfolio, a blend of ginger root, guarana seed extract,\nchromium, vitamins, and green tea extract.\nDuring 2024, we have continued to develop our U.S. Pepsi relationship as well as expanding our international presence through the following arrangements:\n• In January 2024, we announced Pepsi as our exclusive distributor in Canada, as well as a new relationship with Lucozade Ribena Suntory Limited (\"Suntory\") to serve\nas our exclusive sales and distribution partner in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.\n• In March 2024, we entered into a definitive manufacturing, sales, and distribution agreement with Frucor Suntory Australia Pty Limited and Frucor Suntory New\nZealand Limited (both part of the Suntory Group) to expand into the Australia and New Zealand markets. Sales under this arrangement are expected to begin in the\nfourth quarter of 2024.\n• In March 2024, we entered into an incentive program with Pepsi which is intended to better align our businesses as we look to grow and expand our product portfolio\nacross the U.S. The ultimate impact of the incentive program on the Company's revenue and margin will be dependent upon achieving the intended outcomes of the\nprogram.\n• In April 2024, we entered into a definitive sales and distribution agreement with Orangina Schweppes France (part of the Suntory Group) to expand into France. Sales\nunder this arrangement are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n• In August 2024, we entered into a definitive sales and distribution agreement with Schweppes Suntory Benelux SA (part of the Suntory Group) to expand into\nBelgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Sales under this arrangement are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2025.\nWe were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and on November 13, 2023, a three-for-one forward\nstock split of our common stock was made effective for stockholders of record at the close of business on such date.\nResults of Operations\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was approximately $265.7 million, compared to $384.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nRevenue from our largest distributor declined $123.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, which was primarily driven\nby inventory optimization. Concurrently, related retailer promotional allowances created revenue headwinds that would have otherwise been offset by proportional distributor\nsell-in during the quarter.\n31\nEuropean revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $16.2 million, compared to $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue\nincrease in Europe was predominantly driven by successful innovation launches. Asia-Pacific revenues contributed an additional $0.6 million. Other international markets\ngenerated approximately $1.8 million in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe following table sets forth revenues by geographical location:\nFor The Three Months Ended September\n30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Dollar Change Percentage Change\nTotal $ 265,748 $ 384,757 $ (119,009) (31)%\nNorth America $ 247,125 $ 371,178 $ (124,053) (33)%\nEurope $ 16,243 $ 11,038 $ 5,205 47 %\nAsia-Pacific $ 594 $ 1,247 $ (653) (52)%\nOther $ 1,786 $ 1,294 $ 492 38 %\nGross Profit\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased by $71.9 million, or 37%, to $122.2 million, from $194.1 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Gross profit margin was 46% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 50% for the same period in 2023. The decrease in gross\nprofit was due to promotional allowances, incentives, and other billbacks as a percentage of gross revenue. These programs are driven by consumer purchases and sales from our\ndistributors into retail, neither of which correlated with the sales that we made to our distributors this quarter due to supply chain optimization conducted by our largest\ndistributor. Although gross profit as a percentage of revenue was lower year over year, we did receive the benefit of lower outbound freight and materials as a percentage of gross\nrevenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses totaled approximately $125.4 million, up 30% or $29.0 million from $96.4\nmillion for the third quarter of 2023.\nThe increase in SG&A expenses primarily consisted of:\n• a $17.5 million increase in marketing investments;\n• a $9.3 million increase in employee costs, reflecting our ongoing investments to support growth; and\n• a $2.2 million increase in other SG&A expenses.\nOther Income\nOther income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $11.4 million, which reflects an increase of $4.4 million versus $7.0 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to greater interest income earned on cash held in our money market accounts.\nNet (loss) Income Attributable to Common Stockholders\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.6 million, resulting in basic loss per share of $(0.00), based on a basic\nweighted average of 233.7 million shares outstanding. In comparison, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, net income attributable to common stockholders was\n$70.4 million, representing basic earnings per share of $0.30 based on a basic weighted average of 231.0 million shares outstanding. Diluted (loss) earnings per share was\n$(0.00) and $0.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n32\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was approximately $1,023.4 million compared to $970.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This\ngrowth was primarily driven by increased revenues in North America, which experienced continued gains in distribution points, shelf space, and SKUs per location, offset in part\nby inventory optimization from our largest distributor, increased macroeconomic headwinds, and a decline in growth in the total energy drink category.\nEuropean revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $47.1 million, which increased by $15.5 million or 49% from the same period in 2023. The revenue\nincrease in Europe was predominantly driven by successful innovation launches. Asia-Pacific revenues contributed an additional $2.1 million. Other international markets\ngenerated approximately $5.2 million in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe following table sets forth revenues by geographical location:\nFor The Nine Months Ended September\n30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 Dollar Change Percentage Change\nTotal $ 1,023,433 $ 970,579 $ 52,854 5 %\nNorth America $ 968,988 $ 930,545 $ 38,443 4 %\nEurope $ 47,069 $ 31,599 $ 15,470 49 %\nAsia-Pacific $ 2,129 $ 4,111 $ (1,982) (48)%\nOther $ 5,247 $ 4,324 $ 923 21 %\nGross Profit\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit increased by $46.6 million, or 10%, to $513.5 million, from $466.9 million for the same period in 2023. Gross profit\nmargins reflected an increase to 50% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 48% for the same period in 2023. Gross profit margin improvements resulted from\ndecreases in raw and package material unit cost and reduced outbound freight cost as a percentage of revenue partially offset by increased promotional allowances as a\npercentage of revenue from the reduction in disproportionate distributor sell-in.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG&A expenses totaled $339.3 million, up 31% or approximately $79.8 million from $259.5 million in the same quarter of\n2023.\nThe increase in SG&A expenses primarily consisted of:\n• a $56.0 million increase in marketing investments;\n• a $26.6 million increase in employee costs, reflecting our ongoing investments to support growth; and\n• a $2.8 million decrease in all other SG&A expenses.\nOther Income\nOther income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $31.0 million, which reflects an increase of $14.5 million versus $16.5 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to interest income earned on cash held in our money market accounts, partially offset by foreign exchange rate\ntransaction loss.\n33\nNet Income Attributable to Common Stockholders\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $131.0 million, representing basic earnings per share of $0.56 based on a\nbasic weighted average of 233.2 million shares outstanding. In comparison, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income attributable to common stockholders was\n$142.6 million, representing basic earnings per share of $0.62 based on a basic weighted average of 230.5 million shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share was $0.55 and\n$0.60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $903.7 million and $756.0 million, respectively, and working capital of\napproximately $1,074.0 million and $928.3 million, respectively.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our existing cash balances. Please refer to Part 1, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" of our 2023 Annual Report and\nPart II, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" of this Report for specific risk factors that could have a material impact on our operations. We believe that our current cash resources are\nsufficient to fund our cash outflows for both our short and long-term cash needs.\nPurchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, equipment purchases (including coolers), advances to certain of our co-packers, payments of accounts\npayable, and income taxes are expected to remain our principal recurring uses of cash and material cash requirements.\nCash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023\nCash flows provided by operating activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $187.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which compares to $136.0 million of cash\nprovided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The approximately $51.2 million increase in operating cash generated is primarily driven by an\nincrease in working capital, partially offset by a decrease in net income and higher tax payments.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $21.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which compares to cash used in investing activities of\n$9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increased purchases of property and\nequipment, with purchases of approximately $18.0 million in the current year period versus $12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and our purchase of a\nnon-marketable equity security during the third quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, property and equipment purchases were partially offset by\ncollections from our note receivable received from our China licensee of approximately $3.2 million.\nCash flows used in financing activities\nCash flows used in financing activities totaled $18.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which compares to cash used in financing activities of $18.9 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The main driver for cash used in financing activities for both periods was cash dividends paid on our outstanding shares of Series\nA Preferred Stock, all of which is held by Pepsi.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no off balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the\nmost important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make\nestimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no\nmaterial changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates from those described in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations\" included in our 2023 Annual report.\n34\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIn the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in\nmarket rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to,\nincreases in the costs of the price of aluminum cans, sucralose and other sweeteners, as well as other raw materials contained within our products). We generally do not use\nhedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with\nrespect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we\noperate.\nWe do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.\nThere have been no material changes to the information regarding market risk provided in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” contained in\nour 2023 Annual Report.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer) conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30,\n2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,\nwithin the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted\nby us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, or persons\nperforming similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date because of the material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting described below.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will\nprevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our Chief\nExecutive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer evaluated whether our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be\ncircumvented if an individual desires to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing conclusion, and notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below, management believes that\nthe consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with U.S. GAAP and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.\nWe identified a material weakness as of December 31, 2023 in our internal control over financial reporting, which was not fully remediated as of September 30, 2024. A material\nweakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our\nannual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. We concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not\neffective as of December 31, 2023 and was not fully remediated as of September 30, 2024 with respect to the following processes as the result of the ineffective design and\noperation of business process level controls: (i) accounting for revenue recognition, (ii) accounting for promotional allowances, and (iii) accounting for inventories.\nManagement has reassessed the design of controls and modified its processes to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness, including but not limited to\nplacing increased emphasis on appropriately designing and implementing effective business process level controls. This material weakness cannot be considered remediated until\nthe applicable controls are designed and operating effectively for a sufficient period of time, as supported by management’s testing results.\n35\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have been implementing and will aggressively continue to implement changes to improve the control environment with\nrespect to the business process level controls that led to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 discussed above. We\nanticipate the actions to be taken, and resulting process improvements, to generally strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness\nnoted above. These remedial measures were considered changes to our internal control environment that had a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nThe information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies in the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1,\nof this Report.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe face a variety of risks that are inherent in our business and our industry, including operational, legal, regulatory and product risks. Such risks could cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from our forward-looking statements, expectations and historical trends. Other than as set forth below, during the reporting period covered by this Report, there\nhave been no material changes to our risk factors as set forth in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our 2023 Annual Report.\nFailure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business. If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses,\nbrands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results\ncould suffer.\nWe regularly review and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions, is\ndependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the\nanticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals.\nOn November 1, 2024, we acquired substantially all of the equity interests of Big Beverages, a canned beverage manufacturer and co-packing partner of the Company.\nAcquisitions of businesses, brands or bottling operations may involve significant challenges and risks, and the expected benefits may take longer to realize than expected or may\nnot be realized at all. Our business may also be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are\nunable to consolidate operations. To the extent we integrate acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from\nany completed acquisition over the timeframe we expect, or at all, or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of such acquisitions. Integrating the\noperations of acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations can be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks including, but not limited\nto, the integration of company cultures and management teams, retaining key employees and customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance\nrequirements, increased costs, and use of resources. We may face difficulties in operating through new business models and/or supply chain models, or in new categories or\nterritories, and challenges in extending Company controls (including internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, data protection and\ncybersecurity), policies and governance structures (including with respect to food safety and quality, occupational safety, and sustainability) to newly acquired businesses, brands\nor bottling operations, which may result in increased costs and negative publicity. The costs of achieving benefits from acquisitions could be higher than we expected. Therefore,\nthe acquisition and integration of acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve profit margin targets\nwhen expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic financial benefits of such transactions.\nOther risks associated with acquisitions and any other strategic transactions that we may enter into include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial\nreporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in\nconnection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees;\nconforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with respect to environmental\ncompliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers;\nmanaging tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue\nassociated with divested brands or businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different\ninterests than we do; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and\nlitigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n36\nWe rely on third-party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers or their ability to manufacture our products\nbecomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.\nUntil the recent acquisition of Big Beverages, we did not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsourced such manufacturing to third-party co-packers. We continue to\noutsource manufacturing of our products to third-party co-packers, and we have created a network model within North America that encompasses the utilization of co-packers\nand warehousing across each geographical area, as well as alternative warehousing and co-packing capacity, in order to reduce our exposure within each geographical area.\nThese third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises or fail to meet our product specifications, could begin to charge rates that make using their services\ncost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. There could also be food safety concerns or other regulatory\ncompliance issues with our third-party co-packers, which could require them to (temporarily or permanently) cease manufacturing product and/or necessitate destruction of\nproduct that they have already manufactured. In the event of any disruption or delay in production of product by our co-packers, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or\nthe inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative\npacking facilities at commercially reasonable rates or within a reasonably short time period, and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nItem 2.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nPresentation\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\nThank you for standing by. My name is Jayel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time,\nI would like to welcome everyone to the Celsius Holdings Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Wiseman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\nPlease go ahead, sir.\nPaul Wiseman\nSenior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Celsius Holdings third quarter 2024 earnings webcast. With me\ntoday are John Fieldly, Chairman and CEO; Jarrod Langhans, Chief Financial Officer; and Toby David, Chief\nof Staff. We'll take questions following the prepared remarks.\nOur Q3 earnings press release was issued this morning, with all materials available on our website,\nir.celsiusholdingsinc.com and on the SEC's site, sec.gov. An audio replay of this webcast will also be\naccessible later today.\nToday's discussion includes forward-looking statements based on current expectations and information.\nThese statements involve risks and uncertainties, many beyond the company's control. Celsius Holdings\ndisclaims any duty to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nPlease review our safe harbor statements and risk factors in today's press release and in our quarterly\nfilings with the SEC for additional information, which contain a description of risks that may result in actual\nresults differing materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements.\nWe will present results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP measures, like adjusted EBITDA\nand adjusted EBITDA margin and their GAAP reconciliations are detailed in our Q3 earnings release, and\nnon-GAAP financial measures should not be used a substitute for our results reported in accordance with\nGAAP.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our CEO, John Fieldly.\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Celsius reported its third quarter financial results today,\nrevealing continued consumer demand growth and revenue which was broadly in line with expectations we\nset during the quarter.\nCelsius retail sales in the quarter ended September 30 increased 7.1% year-over-year on unit sales\nincrease of 7.3%. Celsius' resilient growth at retail overcame softness in the category, which grew at\n2% in the same period. Once again, Celsius was a significant driver of the overall energy category,\ncontributing more than 16% of all growth.\nTotal revenue for the third quarter was $265.7 million, a decrease from last year, primarily attributed to\ndistributor inventory optimization, which Jarrod will discuss in greater detail on this call. Year-to-date,\nrevenue through September 30 was $1.02 billion, an increase of 5% from last year.\nThe sell-through data we are seeing continues to be supportive of us being the largest driver of the energy\ncategory. I want to reiterate our 3 key growth drivers that we are focused on for the rest of the year and\nbeyond: attracting new consumers into the energy category; expanding the product availability; and\nincreasing consumption frequency. We believe that we're making progress across each of these initiatives\nwill help us pursue our vision of becoming the leading energy drink brand.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nLet me share more details on how we're thinking about each. First, we are continuing to bring new\nconsumers into the energy drink category through premium marketing and innovation around better-for-\nyou, great-tasting energy. Celsius continues to deliver innovative flavors that resonate with consumers,\nsuch as our new on-the-go powders in our Vibe line, and RTDs like Sparkling Watermelon, Lemonade and\nCherry Cola, which we're taking nationwide due to strong consumer demand.\nTwo recently announced Celsius ESSENTIALS flavors, Grape Slush and Watermelon Ice, alongside our\nnew 2025 Vibe and core line innovation previewed at the convenience store trade show, NACS, keeping\nconsumer excitement and category trial high.\nWe believe that Celsius continues to outperform on taste, function and our brand association with the Live\nFit lifestyle that brings new consumers into the energy drink category through our marketing.\nSecond, in terms of expanding product availability, based on recent industry surveys, we expect energy\nwill continue to gain shelf space in the beverage coolers and aisles, with Celsius being a strong beneficiary\nof these gains.\nThis validates positive customer conversations we had last month at NACS. Domestically, Celsius market\nshare has been resilient with our share in MULO+ with Convenience in the last 4 weeks ending October 6,\nrising to 11.6%, an increase of 10 basis points from this time last year.\nWe are focused on reaccelerating our share growth. We believe that our incentive program with Pepsi\nfeaturing priority periods and aligned resources should provide additional tailwinds for us going forward.\nTurning to other channels that are expanding our availability. Approximately 12.3% of Celsius' total North\nAmerica sales to PepsiCo in the quarter was to the foodservice channel, with strong results in workplace,\nrestaurant, recreational, lodging and gaming sales. Lodging and restaurant points of distribution were up\n46% and 27%, respectively, compared to last year.\nCelsius sales to Amazon increased 21% year-over-year to $27 million, up from $22.2 million in the prior\nyear period. Celsius ended Q3 with a 20.4% share on Amazon according to Stackline's last 14-week read\nending October 5, 2024. E-com continues to be a great opportunity for us building brand awareness and\nmaking our product accessible to consumers whenever and wherever they want it.\nSales at Costco in the third quarter of 2024 increased 15%. However, sales to Sam's Club, BJ's were\nnegatively affected due to timing of promotions and innovation loading in the year ago period. The total\nclub channel sales decreased 4% to $60.5 million in the third quarter 2024 from $63.2 million for the prior\nyear period. Our expansion is broader than just North America. In October, we launched in Australia, New\nZealand.\nOur third growth driver is increasing consumption frequency. Celsius expanded energy drink consumption\noccasions with refreshing flavors in our aspirational Live Fit lifestyle. Celsius continues to grow our\npresence in incremental consumption occasions like meal time through our partnerships with leading\nconvenience stores and quickserve restaurants like Jersey Mikes.\nWe're supporting our growth drivers by investing behind the brand, but also in our organizational\nexcellence, scaling operations, advancing technology and developing our people.\nLast week, we acquired Big Beverages, a long-term Celsius co-packer, which is intended to give us\nnew innovation capabilities, greater control of our supply chain, in addition to financial benefits that we\nbelieve will be achieved in the near and long term. We believe that vertical integration like this co-packer\nacquisition is a capital-efficient growth driver and another way we are investing in our long-term vision to\nbecome the leading energy drink brand in the United States.\nWe've also recently established a new center of excellence in Ireland, intended to drive our innovation,\nglobal procurement, supply chain and global marketing forward as we expand further across the U.S. and\ninto new global markets.\nOur field sales key accounts team have begun using AI-assisted selling tools as well as a new mobile\ntechnology that optimizes vehicle routes for further efficient selling and relationship management. We are\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nalso investing in new technologies to improve efficiencies in our orbit model and reduce our freight laying\ncosts.\nImportantly, we welcomed 2 new additions to our already strong Board of Directors, Hans Melotte and\nIsrael Kontorovsky. These professionals bring extended global experience in consumer goods, then a prior\nand present leadership roles at Starbucks, Johnson & Johnson and PepsiCo. Israel replaces Jim Lee, who\ndeparted our Board in conjunction with his move from Pepsi to Target. We thank Jim for his service, and\nwe wish him best of luck in his new CFO role.\nOur customers continue to believe, as we do, that Celsius is a winning brand with a long growth pathway\nahead of us. We are investing for long-term sustainable growth with strategies to energize our customers\nin more places more often. These 3 growth drivers are underpinned by our focus on organizational\nexcellence across people, technology and scale.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jarrod Langhans, to discuss our third quarter\nresults. Jarrod?\nJarrod Langhans\nChief Financial Officer\nThank you, John. While the third quarter was anything but normal, Celsius generated positive net\nincome, despite a significant revenue headwind, demonstrating the strength of our financial position\nand operations. Moreover, we continue to invest in our brand as we stay focused on driving our sales\nand marketing efforts, and we put a portion of our cash on hand toward vertical integration with the\nacquisition of Big Beverages, all of this to invest in our long-term growth.\nThis quarter, revenue was approximately $266 million, down 31% from $385 million in Q3 last year,\nprimarily due to inventory optimization by our largest distributor, impacting revenue by around $124\nmillion. Promotional allowances from increased retail sales created revenue headwinds due to the\nimbalance that existed between the decreased selling to our distributor and increased sell-through at\nretail.\nAdditionally, the previously announced incentive program with our largest distributor and its network\nof franchisees fully ramped up in the third quarter. This program further aligns our financial incentives\nthrough priority periods and other measures, but does impact our margin. Revenue was further impacted\nby reduced unit velocity and softer macroeconomic conditions.\nNorth American revenue for the 3 months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $247 million, a\ndecrease of 33% from $371 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by the previously mentioned\ninventory optimization.\nInternational revenue grew 37% to $18.6 million in Q3 2024 compared to the same period last year. Year-\nto-date, total revenue through September 30, 2024, was approximately $1.02 billion, an increase of 5%\nfrom the prior year period.\nGross profit in the third quarter decreased 37% to $122 million, down from $194 million in the prior year\nperiod. Gross profit margins in the third quarter were 46% of revenues compared to 50.4% for the prior\nyear period.\nThese effects are due to the aforementioned inventory optimization and full implementation of our\nincentive program in the quarter with our largest distributor. However, margin pressures from these 2\nfactors were partially offset by reduced outbound freight costs and savings on the purchase of materials.\nYear-to-date gross profit through September 30, 2024, was more indicative of our full year operations and\nwas $513.5 million or 50.2% of revenue, an increase of 10%, compared to $466.9 million or 48.1% in the\nprior year period.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter were 37.6% and 26.1%\nyear-to-date. While the sales and marketing expenditures were in line with our forecasted expectations,\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nthey were much higher as a percentage of revenue due to the optimization that took place by our largest\ndistributor, which resulted in approximately $124 million less in sales.\nWith that said, we continue to invest and support our brand in a thoughtful manner without creating\ndisruption to our ongoing campaign and investments.\nQ3 2024 general and administrative expenses rose 11% to $25.5 million, representing 10% of sales,\nup from 6% last year. Year-to-date through Q3, G&A expenses were 7% of total revenue, in line with\nexpectations.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for Q3 decreased 96% to approximately $4.4 million from $103.6 million last\nyear, with the year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.8%, totaling $192.8 million.\nQ3 net income decreased 92% to approximately $6.4 million, down from $83.9 million last year with year-\nto-date net income of $164 million. Despite the quarter's pressures, we maintained a cash balance above\n$900 million, and we are generating positive full year operating cash flow.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the lines for questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Salera of Stephens.\nJames Ronald Salera\nStephens Inc., Research Division\nI wanted to maybe drill down on the cadence as we close out 2024 and move into 2025. Just with the\ncombination of some of the increased promotional you guys have in the channel, the new flavor launches,\nis it correct for us to assume that we should see the trends in the scan data have improved sequentially\nmonth-on-month as we move through 4Q and then go into 2025?\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. Thanks, Jim, for the question. We do have a variety of promotional activities planned for Q4 as well.\nThe category is highly promotional as we know. There is a lot of new innovation that's coming out from a\nvariety of other brands within the category.\nWe're watching velocity on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis. We have a lot of great plans in place for the\nback half and heading into 2025, where we're really focusing on our growth drivers of increasing new to\ncategory, expanding occasions, with the usage occasions expanding as well as increasing availability.\nSo those are things we're monitoring. We have a lot of plans in place. Just coming up in the next few\nweeks, we have a big program with Jake Paul, Mike Tyson. We're a title sponsor, so we'll be able to get\nsome further national reach across the country and impressions. And the teams are focused on driving to\nretail.\nJames Ronald Salera\nStephens Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Great. And then maybe if I can sneak in a quick follow-up. If we think about the pressure that the\ncategory has seen, obviously, still one of the better categories across retail.\nJust any thoughts on what you would want to see out of the consumer that would kind of really accelerate\ncategory growth and drive energy drink category growth as we go into next year.\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. I think when you look at the third quarter that we're reporting on today, it was troubled with traffic.\nWe saw a lot of our major retailers talk about reduced traffic in convenience.\nWe need traffic to come back. We need occasions to come back. But the good news is when you look\nat the Celsius portfolio, our better-for-you and this performance energy and fitness lifestyle is a broad\nposition that has a lot of tailwind behind it.\nThe better-for-you is not slowing down. And I think what's really exciting for us as we sit here today is\nin the quarter, we saw for the first time about 50% of the category is greater -- greater than 50% of the\ncategory is now sugar-free. So the sugar-free movement, it continues to build steam.\nWe have an amazing sugar-free portfolio. We need macroeconomic trends to improve. We expect that to\nimprove. We saw some additional growth in the category over the last several weeks from the lows and\nactually the negative growth we saw in the third quarter.\nSo we feel with our function, our refreshing taste profile and our fitness position, we're well positioned\nwhen the category gets back, which we're confident it will. As you said, the category has been in a great\ngrowth driver in LRB. And we're going to increase availability as well, which we're really excited about.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies.\nKaumil S. Gajrawala\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\nI guess, a couple of things. The first is you're specific to mention in your prepared remarks that the new\nincentive structure with Pepsi and that you're positive about it. Can you give us maybe some more details\non what's behind that and why that should drive category acceleration from where we are now?\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. When you look at it, the program -- the further alignment and incentive program we implemented\nin 2004 is really further getting implemented into 2025 with additional focus on priority periods. We just\nfinished NACS last month and coming off their annual operating plan meeting that was in Las Vegas that\nour group -- our leadership team as well as a variety of other team members attended.\nJust -- we're getting great cross-functional collaboration, further alignment on our 2025 plans. And it's --\nwe feel like we're going to have more of a cohesive approach as we're further aligned to truly drive this\ncategory, getting additional availability, expanding placements and getting Celsius in the hands of more\nconsumers and disrupting that path to purchase, which is so critical on building a brand and getting more\ntrial.\nKaumil S. Gajrawala\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\nAnd I guess, the second question is, are they done? Is inventories in the right place? Do we just move on\nwith consumption from here? Presumably, you've chatted with them and hope for no more surprises. But I\nthink we'd all like to know if they're at the place they want to be.\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. We're watching the correlation between sell-in and sell-out. I'll turn it over to Jarrod to provide some\nfurther color on that.\nJarrod Langhans\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. So we've got a handful of weeks of visibility into the fourth quarter. We're definitely seeing a tighter\ncorrelation on a weekly basis between the inventory sell-in and depletions from our largest distributors'\nwarehouses into retail when comparing to Q3.\nIt's not fully matched yet. So there is a slight disconnect from the sell through versus the sell-in with\nretailers, but it's very slight at this point in time. At the current rate, we should see alignment of the sell-\nin and sell-through before Q4 ends based on the trends we're seeing and the discussions we're having.\nSo our teams are definitely working together diligently to minimize any potential impacts in Q4. With\nthat said, we could see some pressure in the quarter. November and December will be key drivers in\nthis process. So as things stand today, depending upon how we end the year, we could see an impact\nwhere we see some positive benefit or potentially all the way up to maybe $15 million of pressure. That's\nkind of our visibility into today. So that's kind of the range we can offer and what we're seeing from that\nperspective.\nKaumil S. Gajrawala\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Did I hear that right, another $15 million for 4Q? Is that what you just...\nJarrod Langhans\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nChief Financial Officer\nI said we could see -- actually see anywhere from a bit of positive benefit from it all the way up to around\n$15 million of pressure, depending upon how we kind of finish off the year.\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. We need to see how November and December turn out.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel.\nMark Stiefel Astrachan\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nJust quickly following on that last comment. I guess, the question -- obviously, that's the question\neverybody keeps asking over and over again. But your range of potentially $15 million of headwind to\nslightly positive, I assume if we're all sitting here trying to look at this from our desks, the best way to\nthink about this would be whatever end demand for the scanner data would look like, right?\nSo if your sales trends are growing somewhere around where they are now, low to mid-single digits,\nhow does that look from an inventory destocking or restocking perspective? I guess, maybe something\nto benchmark it relative to current performance would be helpful. And then I've got a couple of other\nquestions.\nJarrod Langhans\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. It's a good perspective, Mark. So I'd say if you see -- if we start to see things pick up, then we have\na better opportunity to benefit from that perspective. If we see things kind of turn the other way, then I\nwould expect a little bit more pressure.\nSo kind of if we stay where we are, we're probably tracking to not have anything substantial. But you kind\nof -- a little better is a little better for us. A little worse is a little worse for us.\nMark Stiefel Astrachan\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nYes. That's helpful. And then on market share. So I think, John, you said resilience, I think that was the\nword used in the prepared remarks. It is hanging in there. But I suppose, if you think about the share, it's\nstill down, I don't know, 1, 1.5 points from peak in May. I guess the question is, where do you think that\nconsumer has gone? And what do you think Celsius can do to regain that consumer?\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. I think when you look at it through that, going through since that peak of May, there's been a lot of\nchallenges. We've expanded into the convenience channel. That was the biggest opportunity for us within\nshelf space gains.\nAnd we did see some challenges there with foot traffic. We are -- we know from some of the data that\nwe're getting in from Circana, our shopper is potentially taking maybe that one less trip, that one less\noccasion. So we think there's a big opportunity to really target increased consumption in occasions and\nbring those consumers back as confidence returns and the category gets back to growth rate on bringing\nnew consumers in and expanding that.\nWe think we have a great portfolio. The better-for-you movement is there. Sugar-free is there. We've\ngotten a lot of -- there's been a lot of innovation that's come in from some of the largest players that are\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nexpanded trial. Maybe that shopper purchased another product of one of the new flavors that came in on\none of the other brands.\nBut we feel confident in our portfolio. We feel confident in some of the new innovation that's coming\nout for 2025. Coming out of NACS, we talked to many of our customers. And there's a lot of excitement\naround the energy category, expanding additional shelf space. And we heard positive feedback from many\nretailers on resets for 2025.\nSo we'll see how that ends up. But we feel confident we're going to further expand space and availability.\nAnd we've got some great retailer marketing programs planned into '25.\nAnd further alignment that I was talking about, answering the prior question, with Pepsi, we're getting\nfurther alignment each and every week, every month. We're collaborating better each and every day. And\nthis is getting into the third year of the relationship, and we're really looking to leverage that.\nMark Stiefel Astrachan\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nGot it. And just to follow up on that. So your share, it sounds like you're saying, is weaker in C-stores than\nit would be in mass, Amazon, Costco. Is that the way to think about it?\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. And that's historically as -- if you go back even historically as it's been, our share as a percentage has\nbeen better in food, drug, mass and on Amazon. So that's -- the big opportunity is to close the gap.\nWe got good share in a variety of international retailer as well as regional players. We just need to\nclose the gap. We need to get better placements. We need to disrupt that path to purchase. We need to\ncontinue to drive household penetration.\nAnd we feel that the consumer is there. We know the sugar-free consumer is there, the better-for-you\nconsumer, the fitness lifestyle consumer. And we're well positioned to capture that when this category gets\nback to growth.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Grom of UBS.\nPeter K. Grom\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nSo I guess, I wanted to ask about the inventory, but maybe just the assumption for a slight benefit versus\nthe $15 million dollar headwind. Is this something you plan to update us on as we move through the\nquarter, maybe similar to what we saw in 3Q?\nAnd then of that $15 million headwind, what's kind of underpinning that assumption? I guess, I'm just\ntrying to make sure we don't have a similar negative update, if you will, versus -- similar to what we had\nin September where things came in far worse.\nAnd I guess, just building on that, you mentioned better alignment several times throughout this call. But\nhow would you compare your visibility today on the inventory dynamic versus maybe what we saw in the\nspring and the summer?\nJarrod Langhans\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. I think we have good visibility, and we've been working closer and -- closer together. I think some of\nthe -- what got caught up in Q3 was some very good optimization that took place and some very efficient\noptimization. And I think our largest distributor actually commented on that on their call a couple of weeks\nago. So they did a great job with that.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nWe kind of got caught up in that in Q3. In Q4, we're kind of just looking at trends, and we're trying to\nbuild an analysis kind of -- if things got a little better, if things got a little worse, that's kind of the range\nwe provided based on the trends and the data we're following. And so that's our best estimate for you\nguys from that perspective.\nIn terms of Q4 versus Q3, Q3 was really where the optimization took place. Q4 is more a product of where\ndoes the category go more so than, I would say, any kind of significant optimization.\nPeter K. Grom\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nOkay. So that's helpful, Jarrod. I guess, if you were -- as we stand here today, is the best way to think\nabout 4Q North America sales growth is the kind of take what we see in underlying scanner data, call\nit, this low to mid-single digits and back out some sort of assumptions, if we're being conservative, $15\nmillion? Is that fair?\nJarrod Langhans\nChief Financial Officer\nYes.\nPeter K. Grom\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nOkay. And then one quick follow-up, just maybe building on the question on market share. You unpacked\nsome plans here, promotions, innovations. But I guess, a lot of your peers are kind of doing similar things.\nSo I'd be curious what you think is actually different today versus maybe what you were doing over the\ncourse of the summer. And then within that, we're kind of at a point where if you kind of look at the\nsequential market shares, if you hold here, you're going to start to see year-over-year decline.\nIs that something you think we should be braced for as we think about the tracked performance looking\nout over the next several weeks here?\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. Peter, I think there's a lot of variables there within this year. There's a variety of things happening\nfrom consumers, from shopping pattern changes to innovation, to consumer sentiment. We have a\nvariety of different tactics and strategies in place to continue to drive new category consumption, further\nactivating our Gen Z college university program, leveraging our better-for-you, the sugar-free movement.\nIncreasing availability is something we're really working on. Further, that's that alignment and\ncollaboration with Pepsi to really further expand that, cooler placements, path to purchase. You look at\nsome increased consumptions, that occasions, that foodservice, we talked about in the prepared remarks,\nthere's a lot of great opportunities ahead.\nTalk about some national reach. Like I just mentioned, the Jake Paul-Tyson to Netflix supposedly is the\nlargest consumer sporting event -- live sporting boxing event in history, actually. So that will be coming up\nin the next 2 weeks. It will get a lot of reach a lot of eyeballs, further drive household penetration.\nAnd then we've got some great flavor innovation coming in, further aligning that refreshing. We want to be\nthe most refreshing energy drink out there. So we have a lot of great strategy as we continue to evolve,\ncontinue to maximize efforts, target new consumers and build upon that.\nSo as the share goes, we're working hard to continue to drive increased share and increased velocity. And\nthat's what these teams are focused on, and we continue to evolve each day learning, getting better and\nexecuting and evolving.\nOperator\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas.\nKevin Michael Grundy\nBNP Paribas Exane, Research Division\nA couple of questions for me. Just kind of zooming out a bit, but kind of picking up on a lot of the line of\nquestions around the quarter. Has there been consideration around introducing formal guidance, both near\nterm and long term?\nAnd I ask that in the context, number one, historically, you pointed to Monster. We can agree they're kind\nof an outlier, whereas pretty much everyone else in staples issued some sort of guidance, number one.\nNumber two, I would say the range of outcomes in the U.S. now is a heck of a lot more narrow than it\nwas, my goodness, even probably like just 5, 6 months ago. Because I think -- and then lastly, I think you\nguys would know, it's not lost on you for a moment. I think there is a strong desire in the marketplace\nfor greater visibility, more sort of credibility around the results and kind of where we're going, both near\nterm,and long term.\nSo your feedback there, your thoughts there would be appreciated. And then I have a follow-up.\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. Kevin, it's -- there's a lot of variables in our models and our -- the outcome, especially over last\nseveral years. So there's a lot of dynamics at play. At this time, the company is not providing forward\nguidance, but it's not something that we can -- we can reevaluate in the future. But at this time, the\ncompany is not providing forward guidance. It's something we haven't done.\nKevin Michael Grundy\nBNP Paribas Exane, Research Division\nOkay. Follow-up, unrelatedly, international expansion. So I think in the past, there's been somewhat of\na more measured -- or even today, for that matter, a more measured sort of approach. And I think the\nthinking was understandably that there's this massive opportunity in the U.S., and share was just strictly\nsort of up into the right, and that's not when the company finds itself today.\nSo is there a sound school of thought, if you will, to expand international much more aggressively than the\ncompany is today? You're well aware of where your international business is as a percent of mix relative\nto Monster. So it seems like that's a potential value trigger where the company can really lean in to offset\nwhat has been a pretty marked deceleration in the U.S. business. So it'd be great to get your thoughts\nthere.\nAnd then relatedly, do you think you have the right team in place -- the right leadership internationally in\nplace to drive that sort of expansion?\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. Kevin, we just launched -- we've announced several further expansions this year, partnering with\nSuntory for the U.K., Ireland. We also have Australia, New Zealand and France. So we have a lot of new\nmarkets coming on board, which the teams are working on.\nWe agree with you. I think there's a lot of opportunities within international expansion. We are being very\ncognizant of timing and sequencing on the rollout of that on tempered expectations. As we continue to\ngrow and scale, we can -- things can turn out really well.\nSo the same health and wellness trends we see in the U.S. are global trends. We feel confident in our\ninternational expansion. We're going after higher energy drink volume markets. We have great partners.\nWe're getting great feedback from distributors and retailers and alignment with 7-Eleven in Australia, New\nZealand and Tesco in U.K.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nAnd so there's a lot of great things in the works, and we're going to continue to move as fast as the\nbrand gains acceptance -- consumer acceptance, a loyal consumer and roll forward. But we're not setting\nexpectations at this point in time.\nJarrod Langhans\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd just to jump in on that, Kevin, in terms of people or headcount, we are looking to stand up operations\nthat will allow us from a global perspective to expand better or quicker at scale.\nSo we did mention that on our prepared remarks where we are standing up kind of a center of excellence\nfrom a supply chain perspective, innovation, marketing, et cetera. So that will allow us the optionality\naround moving quicker from that perspective.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler.\nMichael Scott Lavery\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nJust wanted to come back to shelf space and the resets and maybe get a sense of how much that's\nalready set for 2025 and kind of what updates you can give us on it. And also curious just maybe how you\nsee the positioning competitively.\nCompare and contrast maybe how you see yourself against Ghost and if it's joining forces with KDP. Does\nthat change anything about the competition for shelf space, if not maybe for this round of resets, maybe\nbeyond? Just love to understand a little bit better how that is all set up.\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. No, Michael, great questions. I think in regards to the resets, like I said, coming out of NACS, there\nwas a lot of great positive feedback around the brand. So we're confident we'll be able to gain additional\nshelf space, better placements and hopefully -- and gain secondary placements as well, increase that cold\navailability to take advantage of those impulse purchases.\nSo the brand is very well received by buyers. We're bringing in incremental consumers, which is very\nvaluable for our retailers as well as our alignment. We just won Supplier of the Year awards over the last\n12 months at a variety of major retailers around the country, including 7-Eleven and Circle K and Casey's\nas well. So we're being recognized by our retail partners.\nIn regards to the acquisition of the most recent transaction with KDP and Ghost, great brands, great\nopportunities for KDP. Just further reinforces the opportunities that everyone is seeing within performance\nenergy, better for you, fitness lifestyle, which is the lifestyle of the future and today.\nSo as I always say, where there's disruption, there's opportunity. So I think that's on us on behalf of the\nteams. We're keeping a close eye. There might be some transitions between distribution networks. But\nwhenever there's disruption in any business, there's opportunities.\nSo our teams will be on the lookout. We're working hard each and every day. And where there's\nopportunities to take advantage, we will, and we'll go after it. But I think the Ghost and C4 are great\nbrands out there.\nMichael Scott Lavery\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nThat's helpful. And just a followup on the balance sheet. You've put a little bit of the cash to work for the\nBig Beverages acquisition, but there's still a big pile there.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nMaybe any thoughts on how to deploy that and/or, I guess, just -- you touched on some of the strategic\nthinking on being vertically integrated. Should we expect more of that to come?\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nYes. I think when you look at our balance sheet, we have an extremely healthy balance sheet. Vertical\n-- most recent vertical integration with Big Beverages really allows us for additional flexibility, take\nadvantage of opportunities. We can do LTOs, innovation and really helps us further optimize our orbit\nmodel. We're very focused on driving and gaining leverage with scale.\nSo this is a major step forward. As we look into '25, we'll be able to gain further leverage, and we're\nexcited about that partnership. So it's a good ROI investment. The cash on our balance sheet allows us to\nbe opportunistic and have availability. So we feel we're in a good position as we currently stand.\nMichael Scott Lavery\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\nSo opportunistic, but not necessarily committed to further vertical integration. Just depends.\nJarrod Langhans\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. It was -- this was a plant that was predominantly Celsius, so it was easy to pick it up and really bring\nit into our system and give us that flexibility around LTOs, innovation and those kind of things.\nBut we don't have the desire to become a co-packer. So it's not something we look at from a long-term\nperspective. It was a great opportunity to pick the plant up. We still believe in the orbit model and the\npartnerships we've created with co-packers across the U.S.\nThis was a co-packer that we were already using as well, so it wasn't something that we suddenly are\ngoing to move to them. It's definitely something -- we like our orbit model. We like to be a little asset-\nlight. But we think in this instance, vertical integration, the opportunity to leverage the business a little bit\nand to have the optionality around LTOs and innovation and R&D was well worth it.\nOperator\nAnd your last question comes from the line of Eric Serotta of Morgan Stanley.\nEric Adam Serotta\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nGreat. Two quick questions. First, how are you thinking about kind of evolving the execution playbook for\nnext year? It seems like, clearly, Red Bull is on the offensive going after the sugar-free flavor space. They\nhave been since the summer. Winter seasonal, realizing it's early, but seems to be off to a strong start.\nAnd Monster having a big push this fall and upcoming winter and sugar-free. So how are you looking to\nevolve the playbook next year, whether it's drill deep strategy or any other execution things?\nAnd second, on pricing, surprised it didn't come up already. But I believe that Monster's price increase was\n-- a list price increase was set for November 1. Have you guys communicated anything to the trade yet?\nAnd if so, what's the time line and magnitude?\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nAll right, Eric. Excellent, Eric. That's the first question in regards around the execution and really as you\nfurther identified the sugar-free movement that's taking place in the energy category with Red Bull now\nfurther leaning in as well as Monster leaning in with some innovation in sugar-free.\nThis just reinforces the opportunity that we have at Celsius as a strong, solid #3 player in the energy\ncategory. This shows the opportunities we have to further work with our retailers and bring more\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\nCELSIUS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 06, 2024\nconsumers in as this category not only grow, it gets back in a growth mode, but further seize the sugar-\nfree energy movement and percentage of business continue to grow at an increasing rate.\nSo we think we're well positioned. The more we can talk about sugar-free, great, and the opportunities\nthat exist for better-for-you products, Celsius is well positioned with our Live Fit mantra and bringing that\nessential energy for life.\nSo we think the increased competition in the space further allows us to further expand over the next\ncoming years and beyond. When you look at some of the strategies that we have for 2025, really\ngoing back to those 3 growth drivers we talked about in prepared remarks and then some of the other\nconversations, new to category is going to come back.\nWe know strongly, more consumers need more energy than ever before. And the consumers coming into\nthe category for the first time today, they're well aware of energy drinks. They're well aware it's part of a\ndaily lifestyle. We're seeing coffee being replaced, that coffee occasion. There's so many other occasions\nwhere energy drink play with the new to category consumer that has evolved. So we're going to continue\nto drive that.\nIncreased availability, we talked about that with some of the Pepsi partnership and alignment, that\nincreasing that path to purchase and then increasing consumption, C&U, foodservice, talk about Jersey\nMike, so many different opportunities to increase awareness, have additional availability in points of\ndisruption as we're moving through. This is the third year in the relationship with Pepsi, and it's going to\nbe a great year as we're heading forward.\nIn regards to pricing, we have talked about that on prior calls. We did roll out a price increase. But we\nhave said we're being cognizant of that, that we don't expect a significant benefit into 2025.\nSo we expect as promotional activities and opportunities exist where we can gain leverage, we will. But\nwe're not -- we have not provided the amount nor have we provided any additional guidance that we will\nhave additional leverage or pricing flow through our financial statements in '25. We're being conservative\non that.\nOperator\nThat concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Chairman and CEO, John\nFieldly, for closing remarks.\nJohn Fieldly\nPresident, CEO & Chairman\nThank you, operator. Thank you to everyone who joined us on our webcast this morning. Celsius continues\nto grow the energy category with our great tasting, refreshing beverages that are on trend for today's\nfitness-minded consumer.\nOur 3 growth drivers, more consumers in more places more often, will guide us now and into the future as\nwe continue to grow the Celsius brand here in the U.S. and around the world. We will share a full schedule\nof upcoming conferences that we'll be attending in the next quarter soon.\nThank you to all of our employees, including our newest members of the Celsius family joining us from Big\nBeverages. Thank you to all our customers, investors, partners who are so supportive of Celsius on our\nmission to change the energy drink category.\nMake it a great day. Grab a refreshing Celsius and live fit.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.
