(Nasdaq: ADEA) (the “Company” or “Adeia”) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“In the third quarter, we signed 7 deals in multiple verticals including consumer electronics, Pay-TV, OTT and semiconductor. Our financial results remain solid as we delivered $86.1 million in revenue and an EBITDA margin of approximately 60%. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy and we are making significant progress in expanding our pipeline of opportunities in OTT, semiconductor and adjacent media markets. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term revenue growth target. We also continued to make accelerated repayments on our debt during the quarter and with our Board’s recent increased share repurchase authorization we look forward to taking a more balanced approach to capital allocation beginning in the fourth quarter, which includes our quarterly dividend, debt paydown, tuck-in acquisitions, and stock repurchases,” said Paul E. Davis, chief executive officer of Adeia. “As demonstrated by the over 100 license agreements we have signed since the beginning of 2021, our preferred approach is to find a mutually acceptable resolution without litigation. However, we occasionally need to file litigation to protect the value of our intellectual property. Earlier today we filed litigation against The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Hulu and ESPN. While we remain open to a mutually beneficial resolution, we are confident in the litigation we filed and are fully prepared to proceed through the entirety of the legal process.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $86.1 million as compared to $87.4 million in the second quarter of 2024\n  * GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.17 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.27\n  * GAAP net income was $19.3 million and adjusted EBITDA was $51.3 million\n  * Cash flows from operations was $14.3 million\n  * Made accelerated debt repayment of $12.0 million on our term loan during the quarter\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * Signed 7 deals across multiple verticals including consumer electronics, Pay-TV, OTT and semiconductor\n  * LG Electronics, a global provider of consumer electronics, signed a multi-year renewal for access to our media portfolio\n  * VIZIO, a leading smart TV brand, signed a multi-year renewal for access to our media portfolio\n  * Liberty Global, a European Pay-TV operator, signed a multi-year renewal for access to our media portfolio\n  * Signed additional renewals with a provider of streaming services and devices, a provider of online programming guides, and an OTT provider in Korea for access to our media portfolio, and signed an agreement with an existing semiconductor customer for advanced hybrid bonding engineering support \n  * Filed litigation against The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Hulu and ESPN\n  * Signed a new multi-year agreement with a leading luxury retailer with a growing e-commerce presence\n\n\n\n**Capital Allocation**\n\nIn October, the Board of Directors approved an increase of the existing share repurchase authorization up to a total of $200.0 million.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company made a $12.0 million principal repayment towards its term loan, bringing the outstanding balance to $537.1 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\nOn September 16, 2024, the Company distributed $5.5 million to stockholders of record on August 27, 2024, for a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, payable on December 18, 2024, to stockholders of record on November 27, 2024.\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nThe Company is adjusting and narrowing its full-year 2024 outlook as follows:\n\n**Category (in millions, except for tax rate)**| **2024 GAAP Outlook**| **2024 Non-GAAP Outlook**  \n---|---|---  \n**Updated**| **Prior**| **Updated**| **Prior**  \nRevenue| $370.0 − 400.0| $380.0 − 420.0| $370.0 − 400.0| $380.0 − 420.0  \nOperating expenses(1)| $246.0 − 254.0| $249.0 − 263.0| $144.0 − 148.0| $145.0 − 155.0  \nInterest expense| $52.0 − 53.0| $52.0 − 55.0| $52.0 − 53.0| $52.0 − 55.0  \nOther income| $5.5 − 6.0| $5.0 − 6.0| $5.5 − 6.0| $5.0 − 6.0  \nTax rate| 15% − 30%| 15% − 30%| 23%| 23%  \nNet income(2)| $65.9 − 69.3| $71.4 − 75.6| $138.2 − 157.9| $144.8 − 166.3  \nAdjusted EBITDA(2)| N/A| N/A| $228.0 − 254.0| $237.5 − 267.5  \nDiluted shares outstanding| 113.0 − 114.0| 113.0 − 114.0| 113.0 − 114.0| 113.0 − 114.0  \n  \n(1) See tables for reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP operating expenses(2) See tables for reconciliation of GAAP net income to (i) non-GAAP net income and (ii) adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA)\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will hold its third quarter 2024 earnings conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific Time (5:00 PM Eastern Time) on Thursday, November 7, 2024.

These forward-looking statements are based on information available to the Company as of the date hereof, as well as the Company’s current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business, financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “might,” “potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “target,” similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, and are not guarantees of future results. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the Company’s ability to implement its business strategy; the Company’s ability to enter into new and renewal license agreements with customers on favorable terms; the Company’s ability to retain and hire key personnel; uncertainty as to the long-term value of the Company’s common stock; legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting the Company’s business; general economic and market developments and conditions; the Company’s ability to grow and expand its patent portfolios; changes in technology and development of new technology in the industries in which in which the Company operates; the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which the Company operates; unforeseen liabilities and expenses; risks associated with the Company’s indebtedness; the Company’s ability to achieve the intended benefits of, and its ability to recognize the anticipated tax treatment of, the spin-off of its product business; unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, natural disasters and future outbreaks or pandemics, each of which may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the Company’s business, are more fully discussed in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the Company’s filings with the SEC are, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. \n\nCauses of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, failure to complete licensing arrangements on anticipated terms and timeline, failure to prevail in litigation we may bring against third parties, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or trading price of common stock. The Company does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.\n\n**About Adeia Inc.**\n\nAdeia is a leading R&D and intellectual property (IP) licensing company that accelerates the adoption of innovative technologies in the media and semiconductor industries.

In addition, adjusted EBITDA adjusts for recurring charges of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide investors with important perspectives on the Company’s ongoing business and financial performance and are helpful to provide investors with an understanding of our core operating results reflecting our normal business operations. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as EBITDA margin, which is defined as EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) do not have a standardized meaning. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached hereto. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. All financial data is presented on a GAAP basis except where the Company indicates its presentation is on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nSet forth below are reconciliations of the Company’s reported and forecasted GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics.\n\n**Investor Contact:**\n\nChris ChaneyVice President, Investor

These forward-looking statements are based on information available to the Company as of the date hereof, as well as the Company’s current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business, financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “might,” “potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “target,” similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, and are not guarantees of future results. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the Company’s ability to implement its business strategy; the Company’s ability to enter into new and renewal license agreements with customers on favorable terms; the Company’s ability to retain and hire key personnel; uncertainty as to the long-term value of the Company’s common stock; legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting the Company’s business; general economic and market developments and conditions; the Company’s ability to grow and expand its patent portfolios; changes in technology and development of new technology in the industries in which in which the Company operates; the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which the Company operates; unforeseen liabilities and expenses; risks associated with the Company’s indebtedness; the Company’s ability to achieve the intended benefits of, and its ability to recognize the anticipated tax treatment of, the spin-off of its product business; unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, natural disasters and future outbreaks or pandemics, each of which may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the Company’s business, are more fully discussed in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the Company’s filings with the SEC are, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. \n\nCauses of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, failure to complete licensing arrangements on anticipated terms and timeline, failure to prevail in litigation we may bring against third parties, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or trading price of common stock. The Company does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.\n\nInvestor Contact:Chris ChaneyVice President, Investor Relations[IR@adeia.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Bx13vO_Tu2suHrjd3Jo3IDX8KobJhy2KBMr_0UUaa4leQFXpkxOPZ5ZrZol7cm-yWFtbbZ76_VfqXg8PhMQ_ZA==)\n\nMedia ContactJoAnn YamaniVice President, Marketing & Communications[Press@adeia.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HQWouXjNNAKjcJGOcV_jIRkBvywcQQ61NRaRRwqq-6ccZzuqc5EA_SYdBGHitAjDTSdyPpgr_Dox8-tagWeFIg==)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ODJlYjI3NjAtMzQwMC00ZDgzLWI5Y2ItNWNiODA5NjY1M2I2LTEyNjIyNDM=/tiny/Adeia-Holdings-Inc-.png)\n\n## Site - Shareholder Tools\n\n[ ![Print Page](/sites/g/files/knoqqb78531/themes/site/nir_pid7854/dist/images/icons/printer.svg) Print Page]()\n\n[ ![Email Alerts](/sites/g/files/knoqqb78531/themes/site/nir_pid7854/dist/images/icons/email.svg) Email Alerts](/ir-resources/email-alerts)\n\n[ ![RSS Feeds](/sites/g/files/knoqqb78531/themes/site/nir_pid7854/dist/images/icons/communications_1.svg) RSS Feeds](/ir-resources/rss-feeds)\n\n[ ![Contact IR](/sites/g/files/knoqqb78531/themes/site/nir_pid7854/dist/images/icons/user_profile3.svg) Contact IR](/ir-resources/contact-ir)\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://investors.adeia.com/news-releases/news-release-details/adeia-initiates-patent-infringement-litigation-against-disney&t=Adeia Inc. - Adeia Initiates Patent Infringement Litigation Against Disney \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Adeia Inc. - Adeia Initiates Patent Infringement Litigation Against Disney+https://investors.adeia.com/news-releases/news-release-details/adeia-initiates-patent-infringement-litigation-against-disney \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://investors.adeia.com/news-releases/news-release-details/adeia-initiates-patent-infringement-litigation-against-disney&title=Adeia Inc. - Adeia Initiates Patent Infringement Litigation Against Disney \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [Google+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://investors.adeia.com/news-releases/news-release-details/adeia-initiates-patent-infringement-litigation-against-disney?&t=Adeia Inc. - Adeia Initiates Patent Infringement Litigation Against Disney \"GooglePlus\")\n\n\n"

(Nasdaq: ADEA) (the “Company” or “Adeia”) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“In the third quarter, we signed 7 deals in multiple verticals including consumer electronics, Pay-TV, OTT and semiconductor. Our financial results remain solid as we delivered $86.1 million in revenue and an EBITDA margin of approximately 60%. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy and we are making significant progress in expanding our pipeline of opportunities in OTT, semiconductor and adjacent media markets. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term revenue growth target. We also continued to make accelerated repayments on our debt during the quarter and with our Board’s recent increased share repurchase authorization we look forward to taking a more balanced approach to capital allocation beginning in the fourth quarter, which includes our quarterly dividend, debt paydown, tuck-in acquisitions, and stock repurchases,” said Paul E. Davis, chief executive officer of Adeia. “As demonstrated by the over 100 license agreements we have signed since the beginning of 2021, our preferred approach is to find a mutually acceptable resolution without litigation. However, we occasionally need to file litigation to protect the value of our intellectual property. Earlier today we filed litigation against The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Hulu and ESPN. While we remain open to a mutually beneficial resolution, we are confident in the litigation we filed and are fully prepared to proceed through the entirety of the legal process.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $86.1 million as compared to $87.4 million in the second quarter of 2024\n  * GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.17 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.27\n  * GAAP net income was $19.3 million and adjusted EBITDA was $51.3 million\n  * Cash flows from operations was $14.3 million\n  * Made accelerated debt repayment of $12.0 million on our term loan during the quarter\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * Signed 7 deals across multiple verticals including consumer electronics, Pay-TV, OTT and semiconductor\n  * LG Electronics, a global provider of consumer electronics, signed a multi-year renewal for access to our media portfolio\n  * VIZIO, a leading smart TV brand, signed a multi-year renewal for access to our media portfolio\n  * Liberty Global, a European Pay-TV operator, signed a multi-year renewal for access to our media portfolio\n  * Signed additional renewals with a provider of streaming services and devices, a provider of online programming guides, and an OTT provider in Korea for access to our media portfolio, and signed an agreement with an existing semiconductor customer for advanced hybrid bonding engineering support \n  * Filed litigation against The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Hulu and ESPN\n  * Signed a new multi-year agreement with a leading luxury retailer with a growing e-commerce presence\n\n\n\n**Capital Allocation**\n\nIn October, the Board of Directors approved an increase of the existing share repurchase authorization up to a total of $200.0 million.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company made a $12.0 million principal repayment towards its term loan, bringing the outstanding balance to $537.1 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\nOn September 16, 2024, the Company distributed $5.5 million to stockholders of record on August 27, 2024, for a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, payable on December 18, 2024, to stockholders of record on November 27, 2024.\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nThe Company is adjusting and narrowing its full-year 2024 outlook as follows:\n\n**Category (in millions, except for tax rate)**| **2024 GAAP Outlook**| **2024 Non-GAAP Outlook**  \n---|---|---  \n**Updated**| **Prior**| **Updated**| **Prior**  \nRevenue| $370.0 − 400.0| $380.0 − 420.0| $370.0 − 400.0| $380.0 − 420.0  \nOperating expenses(1)| $246.0 − 254.0| $249.0 − 263.0| $144.0 − 148.0| $145.0 − 155.0  \nInterest expense| $52.0 − 53.0| $52.0 − 55.0| $52.0 − 53.0| $52.0 − 55.0  \nOther income| $5.5 − 6.0| $5.0 − 6.0| $5.5 − 6.0| $5.0 − 6.0  \nTax rate| 15% − 30%| 15% − 30%| 23%| 23%  \nNet income(2)| $65.9 − 69.3| $71.4 − 75.6| $138.2 − 157.9| $144.8 − 166.3  \nAdjusted EBITDA(2)| N/A| N/A| $228.0 − 254.0| $237.5 − 267.5  \nDiluted shares outstanding| 113.0 − 114.0| 113.0 − 114.0| 113.0 − 114.0| 113.0 − 114.0  \n  \n(1) See tables for reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP operating expenses(2) See tables for reconciliation of GAAP net income to (i) non-GAAP net income and (ii) adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA)\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will hold its third quarter 2024 earnings conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific Time (5:00 PM Eastern Time) on Thursday, November 7, 2024.

These forward-looking statements are based on information available to the Company as of the date hereof, as well as the Company’s current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business, financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “might,” “potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “target,” similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, and are not guarantees of future results. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the Company’s ability to implement its business strategy; the Company’s ability to enter into new and renewal license agreements with customers on favorable terms; the Company’s ability to retain and hire key personnel; uncertainty as to the long-term value of the Company’s common stock; legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting the Company’s business; general economic and market developments and conditions; the Company’s ability to grow and expand its patent portfolios; changes in technology and development of new technology in the industries in which in which the Company operates; the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which the Company operates; unforeseen liabilities and expenses; risks associated with the Company’s indebtedness; the Company’s ability to achieve the intended benefits of, and its ability to recognize the anticipated tax treatment of, the spin-off of its product business; unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, natural disasters and future outbreaks or pandemics, each of which may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the Company’s business, are more fully discussed in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the Company’s filings with the SEC are, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. \n\nCauses of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, failure to complete licensing arrangements on anticipated terms and timeline, failure to prevail in litigation we may bring against third parties, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or trading price of common stock. The Company does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.\n\n**About Adeia Inc.**\n\nAdeia is a leading R&D and intellectual property (IP) licensing company that accelerates the adoption of innovative technologies in the media and semiconductor industries.

In addition, adjusted EBITDA adjusts for recurring charges of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide investors with important perspectives on the Company’s ongoing business and financial performance and are helpful to provide investors with an understanding of our core operating results reflecting our normal business operations. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as EBITDA margin, which is defined as EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) do not have a standardized meaning. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables attached hereto. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. All financial data is presented on a GAAP basis except where the Company indicates its presentation is on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nSet forth below are reconciliations of the Company’s reported and forecasted GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics.\n\n**Investor Contact:**\n\nChris ChaneyVice President, Investor
