(NASDAQ: INVA) (“Innoviva” or the “Company”), a diversified holding company with a core royalties portfolio, a leading critical care and infectious disease platform known as Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics (“IST”), and a portfolio of strategic investments in healthcare assets, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted select corporate achievements. \n\n“For the third quarter of 2024, we continue to deliver strong revenue growth, with solid performance from our core GSK royalty assets, and accelerating sales from our IST commercial products, GIAPREZA®, XACDURO® and XERAVA®. Since the formation of IST, now in its second year of operation, we have shown consistent sales expansion in our commercial products, primarily driven by increasing product demand, validating our investment in hospital-based therapeutics,” said Pavel Raifeld, Chief Executive Officer of Innoviva. “Of special note, XACDURO® was nominated for the Best Biotechnology Product by The Galien Foundation USA in recognition of its pioneering science and positive impact on patients. We are proud of this recognition which highlights the commitment and innovation we are bringing to this space, where there is significant unmet medical need and an immense demand for new drugs. We also continue to further advance our pipeline and are on track to submit a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for zoliflodacin, potentially first in class, single dose oral drug for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea, to the U.S. FDA in early 2025.” \n\nMr. Raifeld continued, “Over the past quarter, we also saw meaningful operational progress across our strategic healthcare assets. We remain focused on prudent capital allocation in our quest to maximize shareholder value and see multiple opportunities for continued value creation.” \n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Royalty revenue:** Third quarter 2024 gross royalty revenue from Glaxo Group Limited (“GSK”) was $60.5 million, compared to $57.0 million for the third quarter 2023. \n  * **Net Product Sales:** Third quarter 2024 net product sales were $27.8 million, which included U.S. net product sales of $19.7 million and ex-U.S. product sales of $8.1 million. U.S. net product sales consisted of $13.1 million from GIAPREZA®, $2.3 million from XERAVA®, and $4.3 million from XACDURO®, a 68% increase compared to $11.8 million for the third quarter 2023. \n  * **License Revenue:** Third quarter 2024 license revenue of $4.6 million included product development cost-sharing reimbursements from our partner. \n  * **Equity and long-term investments:** Third quarter 2024 unfavorable net change in fair value of equity and long-term investments of $35.2 million was primarily due to lower share price of Armata Pharmaceuticals (“Armata”). \n  * **Net income** : Net income of $1.2 million, or $0.02 basic per share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net income of $82.0 million, or $1.26 basic per share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **Cash and cash equivalents** : Totaled $260.6 million. Royalty and product sales receivables totaled $91.1 million as of September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Key Business and R &D Highlights**\n\n  * **XACDURO ®** (sulbactam for injection; durlobactam for injection), co-packaged for intravenous use, a targeted antibacterial treatment for patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by susceptible isolates of _Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus_ complex. \n    * XACDURO**® **was recently nominated for the 2024 Prix Galien USA Award for Best Biotechnology Product, which recognizes excellence in scientific innovation that improves the state of human health. \n  * **Zoliflodacin** : a potential first-in-class, single dose, oral antibiotic is currently being developed in partnership with The Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership (\"GARDP\") for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea. \n    * In September 2024, we presented additional findings on our investigational agent zoliflodacin at the 2024 Sexually Transmitted Infections Prevention Conference in Atlanta. The first oral presentation demonstrated that zoliflodacin had potent _in vitro_ activity against 200 clinical isolates, consistent with previous U.S. surveillance data. The second presentation demonstrated that microbiological cure rates for specific subgroups were comparable to the primary endpoint analysis. Safety in these subgroups was also comparable. \n    * In October 2024, we had five presentations at IDWeek 2024, which took place in Los Angeles. One oral presentation on zoliflodacin included a review of the unique public-private partnership that led the clinical development of zoliflodacin. The second presentation highlighted the activity of sulbactam-durlobactam and standard-of-care antibiotics against _Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus_ complex for hospitalized patients in the U.S. Three posters were presented including two on zoliflodacin: _In vitro_ activity against baseline isolates in U.S. participants from the phase 3 trial and a pharmacometrics analysis supporting dose selection. Surveillance data of eravacycline against clinical pathogens, collected worldwide from multiple infections sites during 2018-2022 was also presented. \n    * We continue to advance zoliflodacin following its successful Phase 3 clinical trial results and expect to submit an NDA to the U.S. FDA in early 2025. \n\n\n\n**About Innoviva**\n\nInnoviva is a diversified holding company with a core royalties portfolio, a leading critical care and infectious disease platform known as Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics (“IST”), and a portfolio of strategic investments in healthcare assets.
