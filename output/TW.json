(Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, and Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), one of the largest stock exchanges in the world, today announced their collaboration to offer institutional investors enhanced access to liquidity in Japanese exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The launch of a new direct link between Tradeweb and TSE’s request-for-quote (RFQ) platform, CONNEQTOR, allows Tradeweb buy-side clients to include CONNEQTOR liquidity providers when launching a trade enquiry on the Tradeweb Japan-listed ETF marketplace. Global X Japan executed the first transaction using this new connectivity. \n\nEnrico Bruni, Head of Europe and Asia Business at Tradeweb, said: “This exciting collaboration between Tradeweb and TSE’s CONNEQTOR platform demonstrates our focus on linking liquidity pools for the benefit of institutional investors looking to transfer risk with a higher degree of certainty. We are in the business of enhancing clients’ execution experience, and we look forward to bringing more time and cost efficiencies to investors trading Japanese ETFs, both locally and globally.” \n\nMoriyuki Iwanaga, President of Tokyo Stock Exchange, said: “CONNEQTOR has been developed as a platform to enable investors to trade ETFs \"faster and cheaper\". We hope that the new connection with Tradeweb will promote investment in the Japanese market by allowing investors outside Japan, who have had difficulty using CONNEQTOR, to easily access ETFs listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from overseas. TSE will continue to strive to provide and develop a highly convenient market environment, where investors can enjoy better prices and smoother execution.” \n\nWith Tradeweb’s direct link to CONNEQTOR, clients can submit orders from the Tradeweb user interface to CONNEQTOR’s list of market makers – in addition to Tradeweb’s network of liquidity providers – and receive the best two-way quote back. Clients will continue to benefit from innovative functionality, such as Tradeweb’s rules-based automated execution tool, AiEX, and the post-trade infrastructure of TSE, where transactions with CONNEQTOR market makers will be cleared and settled. \n\nJooyoung Yun, CIO of Global X Japan, said: “We are very supportive of new initiatives that facilitate greater access to the Japanese ETF market. Tradeweb and CONNEQTOR have responded to the needs of institutional investors in bringing greater connectivity and flexibility, as well as straight-through-processing improvements to Japanese ETF trading.” \n\nThe collaboration with TSE builds on Tradeweb’s award-winning offering that allows buy-side traders to transact Asia, Europe and U.S.-listed ETFs, while benefitting from multi-dealer liquidity, greater pre-trade transparency and competitive pricing. Clients can also leverage Tradeweb’s new generation of automated trading via its AiEX tool, as well as advanced functions such as time release. Tradeweb is a global leader in ETF RFQ execution, revolutionising trading in this asset class since the launch of its first ETF platform in Europe in 2012, in the U.S. in 2016, and in Asia in 2018. Between Q1 and Q3 2024, Tradeweb reported global ETF trading volumes exceeding USD 1 trillion. Over the same period, institutional ETF volumes transacted by Asia clients on Tradeweb’s RFQ marketplace increased by 30% year-over-year. \n\nSince its launch in February 2021, CONNEQTOR has aimed to improve the speed of ETF trading in Japan, allowing investors to trade at real-time best price quoted, while reducing transaction costs and improving operational efficiency. CONNEQTOR is used by more than 250 institutional investors, and they can trade ETFs by requesting simultaneous quotes from market makers around the world, without having counterparty risks. Its monthly trading value reached a record high of JPY 295.5 billion (USD 1.93 billion), and an average daily trading value of JPY 13.4 billion (USD 87 million), a 97% increase over the previous year in July 2024. \n\n**About Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc.

(Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of October 2024 of $54.7 trillion (tn)1. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $2.35tn, an increase of 34.1 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY). Excluding the impact of the ICD acquisition, which closed on August 1, 2024, total ADV for the month of October was up 18.4% YoY. \n\nIn October 2024, Tradeweb records included: \n\n  * ADV in European government bonds \n\n\n\n**October 2024 Highlights**\n\n**RATES**\n\n  * U.S. government bond ADV was up 34.9% YoY to $220.8 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 26.3% YoY to $53.4bn. \n    * U.S. government bond volumes were supported by record volume in our institutional business, as well as strong growth in wholesale and retail volumes. Growth was supported by increased adoption across a wide range of protocols, heightened activity across a diverse set of client types, and favorable market conditions. Strong European government bond market activity, as well as a growing client base, contributed to record European government bond volumes on the platform. \n  * Mortgage ADV was up 28.2% YoY to $248.6bn. \n    * To-Be-Announced (TBA) volumes hit a new record, fueled by continued strong dollar-roll activity and increased macro-rate volatility. October also set a record for the number of specified pool lists executed on the platform, underscoring the growing adoption of our offering. \n  * Swaps/swaptions ≥ 1-year ADV was down 9.4% YoY to $416.6bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 5.9% YoY to $793.2bn. \n    * Swaps/swaptions ≥ 1-year activity was down due to a 40% YoY decline in compression activity, which carries a lower fee per million. Quarter-to-date compression activity as a percentage of swaps/swaptions is trending lower than 3Q24. Strong risk trading volume in swaps/swaptions was driven by volatile markets in the run up to the UK budget and the U.S. election. Clients continued to utilize the request-for-market (RFM) protocol for risk transfers. Emerging markets swaps growth remained strong. \n\n\n\n**CREDIT**\n\n  * Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 32.7% YoY to $7.4bn and European credit ADV was up 17.6% YoY to $2.5bn. \n    * U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), portfolio trading and Tradeweb AllTrade®. Tradeweb captured 17.3% and 7.0% of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. European credit volumes were driven by record volumes in Tradeweb’s Automated Intelligent Execution tool (AiEX) and Tradeweb AllTrade®. \n  * Municipal bonds ADV was down 16.7% YoY to $394 million (mm). \n    * Municipal bonds ADV was down YoY given lower tax-loss harvesting compared to the prior year as well as subdued secondary volumes due to record new issuance in October. \n  * Credit derivatives ADV was up 13.0% YoY to $13.6bn. \n    * Increased hedge fund and systematic account activity, along with heightened credit volatility, led to increased swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity. \n\n\n\n**EQUITIES**\n\n  * U.S. ETF ADV was down 9.0% YoY to $6.5bn and European ETF ADV was up 10.8% YoY to $2.8bn. \n    * European ETF volumes were higher as clients continued to embrace our automated request-for-quote (RFQ) trading tools. U.S. secondary market volumes were muted due to investor sentiment leading up to the U.S. election. \n\n\n\n**MONEY MARKETS**\n\n  * Repo ADV was up 28.7% YoY to $678.4bn. \n    * A continued increase in client activity on Tradeweb’s repo trading platform drove elevated global repo activity. The combination of elevated funding rates, an unwind of the Fed’s balance sheet, and current rates market activity continued to shift more assets from the Fed’s reverse repo facility to money markets. Retail money markets activity remained strong, as investors adjusted to the potential for continued rates cuts. \n  * Other Money Markets ADV was up YoY to $294.6bn. \n    * Other money markets volume growth was driven by the inclusion of ICD volumes in October 2024. \n\n\n\nPlease refer to the report posted to [https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/monthly-activity-reports/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradeweb.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fmonthly-activity-reports%2F&esheet=54147673&newsitemid=20241105822255&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradeweb.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fmonthly-activity-reports%2F&index=1&md5=b33bc50da109ffe396af2abf1bb55abb) for complete information and data related to our historical monthly, quarterly and yearly ADV and total trading volume across asset classes. \n\n**About Tradeweb Markets **Tradeweb Markets Inc.
